3
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,136
How are you feeling,
from your accident?

4
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,470
Fine, thank you.

5
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:24,604
Honestly, if you'd told me five years
ago I'd be sitting here today...

6
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,329
Anthony's attacks,
how do they make you feel?

7
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,163
Well, concerned, of course.

8
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,167
Helpless.

9
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,670
- Frustrated, maybe.
- With your inability to help him?

10
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,346
I was referring to your
inability to help him.

11
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,472
She has helped me.
What are you saying?

12
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:01,558
It's been three years,
you still pass out on a regular basis.

13
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,144
I understand your frustration.

14
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,983
Did he share our insights
about his last panic attack?

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,538
I told you, remember? The capocollo,
and my mother when I was a kid.

16
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,702
Right, yes.

17
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,877
Is there anything in the family dynamic
that could serve as a trigger?

18
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,880
- Something in your dialoguing?
- Excuse me?

19
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:34,048
I don't know you that well.
We're trying to get to root causes.

20
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:39,724
- Maybe you do things that affect me.
- Oh, really?

21
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,516
What?
People affect each other in life.

22
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,726
Oh, is this how it works?

23
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,692
You're looking for someone
to point the finger at?

24
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,025
She didn't say anything.
Don't get defensive!

25
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,454
You know what? Maybe you should
explore your own behavior.

26
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,912
Maybe you pass out
because you're guilty.

27
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,126
You stick your dick in anything,
maybe that's a root cause.

28
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,044
Very nice. That's very nice.

29
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,041
Mm-hmm

30
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,720
I told you months ago I broke it off
with that Russian person. Right?

31
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,854
It's like smoking your whole life
and then suing cigarette companies.

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,939
You agreed to come here.

33
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,769
Forget it, this is fucking ridiculous.

34
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,396
Right, just sit there.

35
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,990
Silence, anger, then you pass out
and you blame the rest of the world.

36
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,657
Yeah, I love you too.

37
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,165
- You're both very angry.
- Must've been top of your class.

38
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,302
Jesus Christ!

39
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,513
What?

40
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,650
Great. And I'm the one that doesn't
fucking communicate?

41
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,781
Want to know what's wrong?

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,329
After 19 years, we have to pay
someone to teach us how to interact.

43
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,497
You were all in favor.

44
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,498
Slow down.
Stop driving like a maniac!

45
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,170
Maybe we'll die.

46
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,333
Think it's easy?
I'm the new kid at school.

47
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,045
- I can't even open my mouth.
- Who's picking on you?

48
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,343
- She took your side with everything.
- Please!

49
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm sure you'll have a good laugh
about it next time.

50
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,226
Yeah.

51
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,183
Oh, motherfucking fuck!

52
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,526
Jesus Christ.

53
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,537
- Happy? What did I tell you?
- It's a fucking speed trap.

54
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,504
How you doing?

55
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,553
Got new shoes.
Soles are a little heavy.

56
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,723
License, registration,
and insurance card, please.

57
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,851
You're with the township, right?

58
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,730
I had dinner with your boss last week.
Tony Soprano.

59
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,238
Please remove the license
from the wallet.

60
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,751
- You know why I stopped you?
- Yeah, I do.

61
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,255
Why don't you and your wife
have dinner on me?

62
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,415
You can tell her about it.

63
00:06:55,582 --> 00:07:01,260
- Are you offering me a bribe, sir?
- Of course not. You gotta relax.

64
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,098
Would you shut the engine, please?

65
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,560
What happens if I don't feel like
shutting the engine?

66
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,024
Dispatch, request backup.

67
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,315
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Tony.

68
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,231
<i>Five-eight-two, what's your 20?</i>

69
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,322
Dispatch, cancel backup.

70
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,247
- This the high point of your career?
- Wait in the car.

71
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,171
Our tax dollars, hard at work.

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,095
You'd think they'd be out
arresting dope dealers.

73
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,976
This fucking smoke's
actually writing me up.

74
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,437
- Stay in the car, Tony.
- Affirmative action cocksucker.

75
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,999
- What'd Freddie want?
- Peppers and eggs.

76
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,952
- Help me carry it.
- I saw a meter maid.

77
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,207
Bullshit.

78
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,341
Get me a Manhattan Special
instead of the Coke.

79
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,175
There's always some fucker
on your machine.

80
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,179
- You shouldn't listen to my machine!
- Shut your mouth!

81
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,810
You know what? Fuck you.

82
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,730
Don't call me anymore!

83
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,483
Get back in the goddamn car!

84
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,401
- Could you give me a ride?
- What the fuck are you looking at?

85
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,365
- We're on a job in Teaneck.
- Two minutes.

86
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,827
- Get back here, Tina.
- Eat shit, asshole!

87
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,531
Can't you just do me this favor?

88
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,709
- Why don't you go?
- Can't you take me?

89
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,370
Look, there's a car service...

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,879
Sal!

91
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,667
What the fuck?
He didn't do anything!

92
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,755
- Come on, you wanna fuck her?
- Stop, he didn't do anything!

93
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,382
What are you doing? Stop!

94
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,763
Get back in the fucking car!

95
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:16,391
Get in the car!
Get in the fucking car, now!

96
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,027
Bryan!

97
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,748
Hey.

98
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,917
How are you?

99
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,915
Thanks for coming, Tony.

100
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,376
Hey. How you doing?

101
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,923
Hey.

102
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,046
I brought him some Whitman's.

103
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,428
How's he doing?

104
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,474
I talked to him before,
I think he squeezed my hand.

105
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,225
He's gonna be a vegetable.
A fucking retard.

106
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,936
- No, he's gonna be fine.
- Look at the bright side.

107
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,772
He wasn't that smart to begin with.

108
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,445
It's a tense situation.
A little fucking levity.

109
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,957
- What are you doing here?
- I can't visit my cousin?

110
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,247
I want this cocksucker
to bleed from his ass, skipper.

111
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,918
- You got it.
- Just say the word.

112
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,299
Go grab us some coffee.

113
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,133
Come on, you kidding?

114
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,806
Better yet, go to the ear,
nose and throat department.

115
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,472
Get your hearing checked.

116
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,816
You tell the cops who did this?

117
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,614
I'm upset, but please.
I know how to keep my mouth shut.

118
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,324
Unless there's a salami sandwich.

119
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,376
What the fuck?
We're having a meeting.

120
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,043
Two minutes he's in charge,
he's Lee lacocca.

121
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,719
Come on. Not here. Come on.

122
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,351
- Any beef with him and Mustang Sally?
- Didn't owe him any money?

123
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,810
No, nothing.

124
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,986
No, this kid's a wack job.
Meadowlands, last year.

125
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:31,192
Threw a hot dog vendor off the
second mezzanine. Too many onions.

126
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,570
Geeg?

127
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,417
- Get him under control.
- With extreme fucking prejudice.

128
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,540
- We gotta go. All right.
- See you, Ton.

129
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,001
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

130
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,213
Thanks, Tony.

131
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,412
If I go and prepare
a place for you...

132
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,416
I will come back again
and take you to myself...

133
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,417
so that where I am,
you may also be.

134
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,552
- This is the word of the Lord.
- Thanks be to God.

135
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,937
There are many rooms
in my father's house.

136
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,224
Most certainly one for Febby.

137
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:50,938
Febby lived a full life,
a life of service to others.

138
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:56,611
His 78 years saw him serve
his family as a devoted father...

139
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,784
his country as a supply sergeant
in the Pacific...

140
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:06,788
and most importantly,
our Lord as a devout Catholic.

141
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,124
When I last visited Febby
in the hospital...

142
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,589
he'd finished his chemotherapy.

143
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:19,175
Though frail and extremely thin,
his fighting spirit was still intact.

144
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,014
His body was wracked with pain.

145
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,647
You know Greg D'Aiuto?
His grandfather had cancer.

146
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,486
They froze him till they find a cure.

147
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,031
Mary. Carmela.

148
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,200
Hugh.

149
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,993
Oh.

150
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,167
- For the poor box.
- Thank you.

151
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,664
- I'm going to check out the hearse.
- Don't get lost, A.J.

152
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,433
Well, I'll see you out at...

153
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,098
See you, Father.

154
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,734
Come here, you.
Let me look at you.

155
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,525
Hey! Come here!

156
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,488
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Wanted to surprise you.

157
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,571
You mean old prick.
I thought you were in Miami.

158
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,830
It's too hot there.

159
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,577
I came to see the grandkids,
and my doctor's here.

160
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,581
Yeah, Bobby said you weren't
feeling too good.

161
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,375
I'm gonna bring the car around.

162
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,092
- Sorry about your uncle.
- Febby was Carmela's uncle.

163
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,262
Buon'anima.
He should rest in peace.

164
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,393
Ninety-four pounds when he died.

165
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,850
He was always thin.
What do you expect?

166
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,526
As long <i>as</i> I got you here...

167
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:59,358
Your godson, Mustang Sally lntile.
He did a Lee Trevino off a guy's head.

168
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,492
That prick is my godson in name only.
It was a favor to his father.

169
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,074
Well, I'm just saying, because...

170
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,789
this isn't the first time.

171
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,796
You do whatever you gotta do.

172
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,587
Just so you heard it from me.

173
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,922
Thank you. And I appreciate you
looking out for Bobby.

174
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,430
He's been a huge help with my uncle.

175
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,432
That one don't need any help.

176
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,935
He's out of jail on a fucking medical.

177
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,272
He makes me laugh, your uncle.

178
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,444
Yeah, we're talking about you,
you cagey fuck!

179
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,777
- You got them all fooled.
- Yeah, that's right.

180
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,241
There's Bobby.
I'm sorry for your loss.

181
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,543
- See you later.
- Okay.

182
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,961
Hey, Hey, Hey.

183
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,343
What the fuck, he's really sick?

184
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,632
That cough.

185
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:05,431
He smoked those Camels
since he's in short pants.

186
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,262
- Lung cancer? Oh, fuck.
- Another toothpick.

187
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,773
What kind of way is that
to talk about a sick person?

188
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:23,359
- Good night, now.
- Good night. Thank you.

189
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,121
Forty-two years. My God.

190
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,626
When it's right, it's right.

191
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,627
We said we'd save the Barolo
for a big night?

192
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,213
Check out these numbers.

193
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:45,971
Heh?

194
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,888
- My God! I knew we were busy, but...
- Not bad, eh?

195
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,101
♪ LA DI DA ♪

196
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,064
I think I'm gonna pass
on the wine tonight.

197
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,608
A night like this,
you're gonna make me drink alone?

198
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,364
What is it, you okay?

199
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,709
You know I love it here,
and you are such a great boss...

200
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,504
but Christopher doesn't
want me working anymore.

201
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:24,761
- Please don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad. I'm happy for you.

202
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,221
You know, with his change
in situation...

203
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,472
You know how he is.

204
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,931
You think I wanna be stuck
in this prison?

205
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,891
I wanted to give you notice. I was
supposed to tell you two weeks ago.

206
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,939
Is it okay if tonight's my last night?

207
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,944
Yeah, I guess I'll get
Charmaine to cover.

208
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,323
Thank you!
I was so nervous about telling you.

209
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,373
Christopher's picking me up.
I'm gonna fix my makeup.

210
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,074
Okay.

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,748
Of course.

212
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,314
You're not gonna jump me?

213
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,773
- What?
- I'm open here. I'll have to king you.

214
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,985
Fuck it, I don't want to play.

215
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,946
I don't really want to either.

216
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,705
- What's with you? All day, Gloomy Gus.
- Sorry, it's just...

217
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,461
It's my father.

218
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,589
He's tough, he'll beat it.

219
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,295
- It's not the cancer, it's Tony.
- Tony? What about him?

220
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,300
Don't speak in anagrams.

221
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:55,101
- He okayed my dad to hit Sally.
- He put that kid in a coma.

222
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:00,979
Fuck Sally, I'm worried about my
father. He's been retired seven years.

223
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,100
Are we in the Navy?

224
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,236
It's not that.
This was a proud man, Junior.

225
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:15,705
He's over the other night, I had to
help him off the toilet, he's so weak.

226
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:21,336
Shut the fuck up with the toilets!
All this morbidity!

227
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm sorry, you're right.

228
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,171
Fuck.

229
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,266
This point in his life,
to have him do a thing like this.

230
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,686
I never ask you for anything.
Tell Tony I'll do it if he wants.

231
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,566
Fuck what he wants.
I'm the boss.

232
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,779
You're right, I'm sorry.

233
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,323
Stop your crying! I'll tell him.

234
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,027
Making me fucking depressed now.

235
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,539
Bacala's okay with it.
Why do you care?

236
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,870
- What is it with these power trips?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

237
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,550
- Pardon me. May I?
- Yeah.

238
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,180
- Your girl got any coffee out there?
- I think we can rustle some up.

239
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,355
Tax code, another client.
IRS troubles.

240
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,105
Sorry, Mel. To find a place
they're not allowed to bug...

241
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:33,074
- Dr. Schreck's office is full.
- I sit too much anyway.

242
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,416
It has to be the old man?
There's no other way?

243
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,454
There's a million ways,
but this'll work.

244
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,422
It was Gigi's idea,
I'm not cutting his balls off.

245
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:56,548
Sally's MIA. Two days ago he
reaches out to Bacala for help.

246
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:02,604
Old man Bacala's his godfather, he can
get close without arousing suspicion.

247
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,769
- Doesn't sit right.
- He's done it before.

248
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,273
- He's a sick man!
- It's something to live for.

249
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,790
I took those Duncan Sheik records
and shoved them up his ass.

250
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,376
Wait a minute.

251
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,456
- Who let this one in?
- Wolfgang Fuckface.

252
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,835
Hey, Artie.

253
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,685
The man who stole her away.

254
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,064
Adriana, she gave her notice.

255
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,195
Help yourself.

256
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,659
You better be good to that girl.

257
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,877
You cocksucker.

258
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,584
No wonder the food sucks.

259
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,920
You're supposed to cook
with the wine, Artie.

260
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,717
Three years.

261
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,550
Best hostess I ever had.
This piece of shit steals her away.

262
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,100
- Artie, come on.
- He knows I'm breaking his balls.

263
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,346
Alright.

264
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:36,314
Seriously, though.
I'm you, I hire a food taster.

265
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,824
Don't fuck with a chef.

266
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,574
You're the only one
who can swing a meat cleaver?

267
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,365
- Fuck you.
- Artie.

268
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,830
I'm kidding!

269
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,714
Wanna try cooking
with one fucking eye?

270
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,379
That's enough!
Go wait outside!

271
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,257
Now!

272
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,976
What the fuck?

273
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,698
What the fuck is wrong with you?
She's his fiancée!

274
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,366
I loved her.

275
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,611
I fucking love her now.

276
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,418
Artie, do me a favor.

277
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,217
Don't ever fucking say that again
to anybody, ever.

278
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,761
What am I, a joke?

279
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,599
Yeah, a stupid fucking bald one.

280
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,847
Not to mention married.

281
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,309
Can I tell you something?

282
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,643
She's a cunt, my fucking wife.

283
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:02,408
A girl like Ade, that's a woman.
If I still had my hair...

284
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,238
She's a young girl. You could have
hair like fucking Casey Kasem.

285
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,118
It won't make a difference.

286
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,406
Yeah.

287
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,092
Now look, go in the back,
get some coffee.

288
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,469
Go home, go the fuck to sleep.

289
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,179
I should go apologize.

290
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,813
Not right now, okay?
Let me talk to Chris.

291
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,849
You go home.

292
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,445
Call me tomorrow.

293
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,074
Got a business opportunity
over in Newark.

294
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,161
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

295
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,264
Mr. Spears for you on three.

296
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,138
Seth, I gotta take this.

297
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,810
All right.

298
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,096
Hey.

299
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,599
What about this speeding ticket?

300
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,981
<i>- What?
- I just got</i> a <i>letter in the mail.</i>

301
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,402
Throw it out.

302
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,694
I gotta call my guy down at the DMV?

303
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:29,529
<i>It's a deplorable situation
and I'll take care of it.</i>

304
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:33,162
Good news about the
riverfront esplanade thing.

305
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,619
Just straighten the fucking
ticket out, okay?

306
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,418
Where's your father?

307
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,056
He stopped by the bakery.
Wanted to pick up a shortcake.

308
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,517
He never comes empty-handed.

309
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,895
Talk to Tony?

310
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,778
No, I decided against it.
I didn't even call him.

311
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,861
This life comes with responsibilities.

312
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,569
- Your old man knows that.
- I was asking for me.

313
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:14,411
Teddy Roosevelt gave an entire
speech with a bullet in his chest.

314
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,624
Some things are a matter of duty.

315
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,143
Son of a bitch.

316
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,192
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Fucking steps.

317
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,619
Well, here, sit down. Jesus.

318
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,246
Fuck, is that blood?

319
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,957
Jesus Christ, call a fucking doctor!

320
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,254
No, no, no.

321
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,928
It's the nodules in his lungs.
It happens when he's out of breath.

322
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,810
St. Dennis, is this what it comes to?

323
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:21,349
Get him some water!
These doctors, what are they doing?

324
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,143
I don't know, whatever they do.

325
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,356
Water.

326
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,232
I want you to call John Kennedy
at St. Barnabas.

327
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,737
Junior, I'm happy with my guy.

328
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,786
What is he doing?
Are you on chemo?

329
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,490
Is he giving you oxygen therapy?

330
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,585
Junior, the cure is worse
than the fucking illness!

331
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:49,631
Cocksucker! This is an outrage!
You can't clip someone like this!

332
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,383
Junior, I want to do it.

333
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,556
Eight years sitting on my ass.
It'll feel good being useful.

334
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,351
He's tough.
What if things don't go your way?

335
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,187
If they don't, they don't.

336
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,861
What the fuck, I'm dead anyway.

337
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,332
Paul Newman's dressing
makes 100 million a year...

338
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,081
and people love my sauce.

339
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,871
Arthur, you run a restaurant.

340
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,508
What do you know
about mass production?

341
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:36,216
I have an associate's in business.
We can't grow unless we take risks.

342
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:42,556
Going into business with a gangster
isn't a risk. It's a sure disaster.

343
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,900
It's legitimate.
It's part of the revitalization.

344
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,939
Newark gives tax breaks
for reopening old factories.

345
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,698
I'm trying to work.

346
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,073
Fuck the Vegetables.

347
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,275
We have a chance
to have our own company.

348
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,243
Our own line of products.

349
00:28:57,244 --> 00:28:59,910
Then why is it called Satriale's?

350
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,913
The pork store has a customer base.
Name recognition.

351
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:10,254
Vesuvio doesn't? Your grandfather
opened up in the '30s, Arthur.

352
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,759
Tony talked to this marketing guy.

353
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:18,675
Brand names beginning with a "V"
make people think of vagina. Turnoff.

354
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,349
- What did you just say?
- Vaseline, et cetera.

355
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,105
The whole thing is...

356
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,110
- Can't you see the opportunities?
- To be a mob front.

357
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:33,356
- Jesus Christ, already.
- When are you gonna learn?

358
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,941
Be happy in thine own self.

359
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,371
I'm telling you, the DVD's incredible.
Flat screen, fucking Surround Sound.

360
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,667
"In this world or the next,
I shall have my revenge."

361
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,959
Here we go.

362
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,631
It's like the chariots are going
through the fucking house.

363
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,632
Skateboard's not enough.

364
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,305
Sweetheart, more water, please.

365
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,481
So I hear you got old man Bacala
making a comeback?

366
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,444
He didn't hear it from me.

367
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,691
I'm not butting in.
Junior asked me to talk to you.

368
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,535
He's just looking out
for the old man.

369
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,155
It does seem a little extreme.

370
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,500
But my man Gigootz knows
what he's doing.

371
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,583
- Glad I have your fucking approval.
- Whatever you say, cappy.

372
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,761
Here it is. For you, Junior,
and anybody the fuck else.

373
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,924
Gigi's captain.
He gave the order.

374
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,432
I okayed it.
End of fucking story.

375
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,145
Tony, no offense.
Obviously it's your call.

376
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,942
Yeah, obviously.

377
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,331
- What?
- Nothing.

378
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,545
It's just, you send in an old man?

379
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,544
What's he gonna do,
gum him to death?

380
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,756
- Anybody ask for your input?
- No, no, I'm just saying.

381
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,713
You should let me do it.

382
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:28,179
I'll take the guy apart at the joints.
With him conscious.

383
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,498
This way, sir.

384
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,929
We got all kinds...

385
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,645
Whoa, it's Shaft.

386
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,405
- What, are you here on a stakeout?
- May I help you?

387
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,279
I need a piece of this.
Unless you wanna come over...

388
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,992
check out my birdbath,
make sure it's up to code.

389
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,161
I'll check the computer.

390
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,131
Get your ticket book.
That constitutes indecent exposure.

391
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,091
I no longer need my ticket book.

392
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,648
Your friend, the assemblyman, had me
transferred to the property room.

393
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:58,561
- No longer the scourge of Cedar Grove?
- Nor eligible for overtime.

394
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,987
Leon, take your break at 2.

395
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:12,458
Just so you know, I didn't tell him
to do any of that shit.

396
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,838
That's very kind of you.

397
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,049
We're out of stock.

398
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,216
Tony!

399
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,221
- Tony, the phone!
- All right! Jesus!

400
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,980
He'll be right with you.

401
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,476
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

402
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm going to Fortunoff's.

403
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,481
- When are you coming home?
- When I'm done.

404
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,870
<i>- Hello?
- It's Ron. You paged me?</i>

405
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

406
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,370
I ran into that guy, the traffic cop?

407
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:02,042
- It's done, already taken care of.
- I know, <i>it's</i> just...

408
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,926
- You <i>got him busted off the street?
- Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

409
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:12,059
Yeah, but it's kind of harsh, no?

410
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,432
I spoke to his unit commander.

411
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,518
Nobody likes him.
He's a rabble-rouser.

412
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,522
Yeah, maybe. But I don't know, it...

413
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,572
It goes beyond you.
The guy's depressed or something.

414
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,904
They think he might have
some serious mental problems.

415
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,676
Cocksucker.

416
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,601
<i>You're a liar!</i>

417
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,894
<i>What was he lying about?</i>

418
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,071
- The old man?
- What's he look like?

419
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:19,001
- Like an old fucking man.
- He's all coughing and shit.

420
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,211
Uncle Bobby, thank God.
Thanks for coming.

421
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,471
More fucking stairs.

422
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,317
You should quit while you're young.

423
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,606
- Gotta die from something.
- Take that shit out of here.

424
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,656
All right, I'm sorry.

425
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,659
Let me talk to my uncle.

426
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,578
Over here.

427
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,999
- Who's this little spic?
- He fucks the lady whose house it is.

428
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,129
I'm sorry.

429
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:11,128
You put that kid
in a fucking coma, Sal.

430
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:19,061
- For what, talking to some puttana?
- I know I was wrong. I'm sorry.

431
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,026
He wasn't some citizen.
The kid has friends.

432
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:32,533
I'm sorry, Uncle Bobby. Whatever
Tony Soprano wants me to do.

433
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,908
Take it easy, I got you a <i>pass.</i>

434
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,660
Thank you.

435
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,292
Thank you so fucking much.

436
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,295
It's good you called,
that's all I'm gonna say.

437
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,002
Tell Tony it won't happen again.

438
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,965
Or if it does, I'll at least yell
"Fore!" next time.

439
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,598
I'm sorry, I shouldn't make jokes.

440
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,058
- Get me a glass of water.
- Yeah.

441
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,574
- You want ice?
- No.

442
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,446
Let the water run,
make sure it's cold.

443
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,199
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

444
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,795
So this guy still in a coma?

445
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,092
Should I visit him,
or is that too fucked up?

446
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,102
Yeah, I think you should go see him.

447
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,437
I don't know.

448
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,439
Maybe I should send flowers,
or some shit.

449
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,403
Oh, what the fuck?

450
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,278
Hey, you fucking greaseball, you.

451
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,614
Any more smart remarks?

452
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,618
No, Mr. Bacala, please!
Please, no more!

453
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,842
Mmm...

454
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,549
Oh, shit!

455
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,753
All the fucking luck!

456
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,048
I said he shouldn't do it.

457
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,882
I had to go all the way
to Staten Island to identify him.

458
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:32,222
- He's a cold-hearted prick, my nephew.
- Cocksuckers didn't even clean him up.

459
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,810
He still had bits of glass in his hair
from the windshield.

460
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,609
What was he, 71?

461
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,112
I don't know, 68.

462
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,786
What did they say?
What was the cause of death?

463
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,947
Who? What do you mean?

464
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:55,120
Was it the cancer or the accident?
How advanced was the metastasis?

465
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:59,754
All due respect, Junior,
what do you care about the details?

466
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,427
All this technical shit?

467
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,763
You're right.

468
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:12,680
The man's passed on.
We should let him rest in peace.

469
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,396
He was a good man, your father.

470
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,652
A good friend.

471
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,942
Motherfucker!

472
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,657
Goddamn it!

473
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,568
Dirty bastard!

474
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,994
Son of a...

475
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,915
Jesus-fucking-Christ!

476
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,172
- Good night.
- Bye.

477
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,732
Customer says good night,
you barely look up?

478
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,524
I said it low.

479
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,197
Miss Personality over here.

480
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,699
What's with the glasses?

481
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,994
I left my contacts home.

482
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,294
I don't know what it is, but you've
had a hair across your ass all week.

483
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,385
Lower your voice.

484
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,426
Still mad because I told you
you can't go in with Tony?

485
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,391
You don't tell me anything,
Charmaine.

486
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,349
And I'm going into business with Tony.

487
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,855
If you do this, Artie,
if you choose Tony over me...

488
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,107
What are you gonna do, divorce me?

489
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,661
- Is that what you want?
- What'd I say?

490
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,580
This marriage is over, Arthur.

491
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,461
- I'm serious.
- It's about fucking time.

492
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,252
And you're not getting
the kids, either!

493
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,761
Son of a bitch.

494
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,103
Hey. Look who's here.

495
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,184
- He volunteered to mow your lawn.
- I did not.

496
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,401
Hi, Anthony.

497
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,323
It's that time of year.
Brought the last of my sweet corn.

498
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,289
What's the matter?
You all right?

499
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:43,789
Anthony, be a good boy. Wait outside.
I need to talk to your father.

500
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,096
If this is about old man Bacala,
I don't wanna fucking hear it.

501
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,179
I have cancer.

502
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,824
- You have what?
- Cancer. The big casino.

503
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,828
Jesus Christ, when did you find out?

504
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,290
Blood in my stool.

505
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,749
Had a test before
your mother's funeral.

506
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,672
That's why you been acting
so fucking weird?

507
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:33,639
I mean, where is it?
Is it in your colon, or...?

508
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,215
My stomach.

509
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,977
Jesus Christ, Uncle Jun.

510
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,780
- Did they say how bad?
- Won't know until they open me up.

511
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,199
I go in in two weeks.

512
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:02,375
- This has to stay between us, Anthony.
- Yeah, of course.

513
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,877
Look, we'll get you help.
We'll get you the best there is.

514
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,217
First Jackie with cancer, then Febby.

515
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:20,351
Old man Bacala had it,
but now you'll get me help?

516
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,519
These things come in threes.

517
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,113
Is that why you didn't want
the old man to make the hit?

518
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:40,573
What, if he died of cancer,
he'd take your place?

519
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:46,704
- I asked you not to make him do it.
- Jesus Christ! Un-fucking-believable.

520
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,629
I'm serious, Anthony.

521
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,590
Promise me that you'll
dummy up about this.

522
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,882
Yeah, all right.

523
00:45:55,086 --> 00:46:00,092
You're sick, people treat you
like a nonentity. I'm serious.

524
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,220
You can't talk about this
with anybody.

525
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,556
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

526
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,482
Of course.

527
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,606
- Hello?
- Uncle Jun's got cancer.

528
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,790
A lot of death.

529
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,410
Ma.

530
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:36,136
- Pop and the emphysema.
- Uncle Jun. Another toothpick.

531
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,472
Hey, Jan, come on.
A little respect, huh?

532
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,305
I'm sorry, it's just what Ma
used to say.

533
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,762
Yeah, that's right.

534
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:50,767
- She said that about her own brother.
- Another toothpick.

535
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,020
Jesus.

536
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,611
What was he, 36 years old,
Uncle Mickey?

537
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,367
Liver cancer.

538
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,115
Jesus. These old-timers.

539
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:13,040
The more hard-ass their attitude,
the more they suppress their feelings.

540
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:16,919
- I think it's the illusion of control.
- Control?

541
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:23,509
You say the most horrible shit you can
think of in the face of tragedy.

542
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,969
It's like saying to God:

543
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,648
"See? You don't fool me, asshole.
I know what you're planning."

544
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,194
Yeah, like they're trying
to ward off evil, or some shit.

545
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,948
Remember how Ma,
she hated compliments?

546
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,033
Giving or taking them?

547
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,329
Because then maybe,
at any minute, boom!

548
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,168
I really been coming to know Christ.

549
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,379
Ma, Febby, Uncle Jun?

550
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,513
Always comes in threes.

551
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,388
And then there's the Holy Trinity.

552
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,053
You think that's a coincidence?

553
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,236
What happened to Sal Bonpensiero?

554
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,367
Witness protection.

555
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,375
Would you like to pray with me?

556
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,371
<i>Two weeks ago?</i>

557
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,675
<i>Why didn't you say anything?
Did you report it?</i>

558
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,835
Campus security's a joke.

559
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,597
Don't you think they should know
there's a thief?

560
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,472
- Who? What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

561
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,729
Her bike was stolen two weeks ago.

562
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,810
The ten speed?

563
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,734
- Didn't you lock it up?
- They used bolt cutters.

564
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:42,568
A black guy from the neighborhood.
One of the kids saw him.

565
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,121
- What?
- Did I say anything?

566
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,133
A black guy? Imagine that.

567
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:07,589
- Tony...
- It's just, I can't believe it.

568
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,514
I am not listening.

569
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,096
You're thinking the same thing.

570
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,393
What did I say?

571
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,856
You're twice as likely
to be robbed by a black.

572
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,608
- That is so racist!
- It's a fact.

573
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,651
<i>From who, David Duke?</i>

574
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:26,028
- Why are they in the basement?
- Try the FBI. <i>I</i> saw it on <i>TV.</i>

575
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,034
<i>- You're quoting the FBI?
- They aren't.</i>

576
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,113
- But the lamp?
- On battery backup.

577
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,622
- Why?
- Crime is economic, not racial.

578
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:41,043
You're more likely to steal
if you're poor...

579
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,420
which most black people are.

580
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,135
Wait till one takes your stereo.

581
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,928
You're a hypocrite!

582
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,344
This is what I've been saying!
Stay with your own!

583
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,592
Wait a second.

584
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:57,229
- Where are you taking that lamp?
- Mine gives me a headache.

585
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,401
<i>- Don't change the subject!
- I'm out of here!</i>

586
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,153
<i>Be sure to call
when you need some money!</i>

587
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,696
Now you got something you can
rat me out about in therapy!

588
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,873
- Madonna, this place!
- You only retire once.

589
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,758
Is that an earring?

590
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,385
Huh?

591
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,397
- Your ear, I never noticed before.
- This?

592
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,648
Had it for years.
I don't wear it all the time.

593
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,983
Did Chris tell you
we had a little run-in?

594
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:53,198
- He's just jealous.
- Of what? We're friends.

595
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,621
Well, you know how he is.

596
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:02,746
- I'm glad he didn't make you cancel.
- He thinks I'm with Cindy.

597
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,469
I'm gonna miss you, Ade.

598
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,223
I'm gonna miss you too, Artie.
Charmaine, the busboys.

599
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,971
Charmaine...

600
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,306
What? What's wrong?

601
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:27,486
Charmaine and me, we're gonna
try it apart for a little while.

602
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,821
- Oh, my God, are you okay? The kids?
- It's for the best.

603
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,988
Did I tell you I'm gonna
go into business with Tony?

604
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,460
- What, like a restaurant?
- Satriale Foods.

605
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,999
We'll probably change the name
to Vesuvio.

606
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,345
Sauce, taralli, ravioli.

607
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,343
That's great. Congratulations!

608
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,849
You change your mind,
there's room on my staff...

609
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,310
for a bright, sexy vice president.

610
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:13,817
It's a big step. Marriage.

611
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,038
- You sure you're ready?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

612
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:37,716
- You know where the ladies' room is?
- Yeah, I think it's behind the bar.

613
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,140
Okay...

614
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,388
No, No...

615
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,400
The plate is hot.

616
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:01,410
Restaurants, stores,
slips for luxury yachts.

617
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:07,704
We go with my plumbing and electrical.
The steel and brickwork, all yours.

618
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:13,380
- We need to talk about Local 187.
- You gotta see the scale model.

619
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,382
There are even little people.

620
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,263
Fucking Newark. They got little
hookers giving little blowjobs?

621
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,437
I gotta go take a leak.

622
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:35,443
I got a call from Eddie Voehl
at the PBA.

623
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,281
Your friend the cop
is bitching about his overtime.

624
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:43,410
He's got some black officer's squad
looking into his case.

625
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,828
Ch, yeah?

626
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:52,798
If you want, I can get it squashed.
Get him reassigned.

627
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,296
You know what? Fuck him.

628
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,431
Cocksucker got what he deserved.

629
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,485
Yes?

630
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,071
The Tony Soprano wiretap
has been neutralized.

631
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,454
What do you mean?

632
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,519
- Hello?
- In here.

633
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,149
What are you doing?
You're not ready?

634
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,319
I'm not going.

635
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,871
- They gave you permission.
- I can't. I'm not up to it.

636
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:10,789
- It's my father's funeral.
- You hear me, I don't feel up to snuff.

637
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,873
You look okay to me.

638
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,798
Junior?

639
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,752
Didn't you get my flowers?

640
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,176
My whole family's in the car.

641
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,055
I gotta tell you,
I take this as a personal insult.

642
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,266
- Think I don't care?
- What else can I think?

643
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,899
You selfish fuck,
I can't go because I'm sick!

644
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,899
I have cancer.

645
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,648
Cancer?

646
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,569
Oh, my God.

647
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,907
Real wisenheimer,
now how do you feel?

648
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:58,632
Two weeks, I go in for the surgery,
and I'll start the chemo after that.

649
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,465
Junior, I'm sorry.

650
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:08,802
- I don't know what to say.
<i>- I'll</i> say a prayer for your old man.

651
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,807
My father.

652
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,230
NOW you?

653
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,316
What the fuck is happening?

654
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,951
<i>You will miss the boat.</i>

655
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,039
<i>Lady, I missed the boat</i>
a <i>long time</i> ago.

656
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:43,089
Including tax and delivery,
it comes to $897.23.

657
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:47,264
Just make sure it gets to my house
in one piece.

658
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,680
Come on.
