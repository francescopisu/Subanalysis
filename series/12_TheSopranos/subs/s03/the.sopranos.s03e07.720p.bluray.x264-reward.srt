2
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,776
I want you
to count backwards from 10.

3
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,859
Ten, nine...

4
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,951
eight, seven...

5
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,993
Mr. Soprano, there's someone
here to see you.

6
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,920
Even here, you hector me?

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,716
The director has authorized us
to make you an offer.

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,802
Give up your nephew Tony.
Help take him down.

9
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,597
- What do I get?
- Guaranteed cure.

10
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,556
- No more cancer?
- Not a single diseased cell.

11
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:31,532
<i>I'm happy for you.
I know you've waited a long time.</i>

12
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,330
<i>- I don't like it.
-  Don't let people take advantage.</i>

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,455
<i>I'm kidding, you old fuck.
What's the matter with you?</i>

14
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,133
<i>Dr. Kennedy? It's Dr. Enloe. I have
the results for the frozen section.</i>

15
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,758
Can we move this along?
I have a thyroid in OR six at 10:30.

16
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:56,344
Based on the preliminary results
and depending on the full report...

17
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,022
<i>- Is it clean, Enloe, or not?</i>
- Yes, <i>it's</i> clean.

18
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,354
- Miles, you close.
- Quickly.

19
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,646
I've got his BP up,
don't know for how long.

20
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,157
Watch and learn, Miles.
Watch and learn.

21
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,122
Well?

22
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,711
Your uncle is a very strong man.
He did very well. The news is good.

23
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,220
- Beautiful.
- So the cancer is...?

24
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,054
Gone? You bet.
I took out a tumor the size of a fist.

25
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
<i>Oh, Madonna.</i>

26
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,230
So if you'll excuse me,
I have another patient waiting.

27
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,728
Cheryl, make sure Marty gets
that Goldman Sachs statement. Yes?

28
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,567
I just wanted to say thanks, you know?

29
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,327
My uncle thinks the world of you.
If there's anything I can do...

30
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,829
a favor, anything, let me know.

31
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,249
I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Soprano.

32
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,249
Game three.

33
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,754
- That's $60.
- Good luck getting it.

34
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,677
I won, Paulie.
It's only right you pay.

35
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,092
- And for other things.
- Like what?

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,889
Fucking Dom Perignon for everybody
in the skybox at the Garden.

37
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,056
Check comes, you're MIA.

38
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,691
You're worried about what I give you.
Worry about what you give me.

39
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:35,447
- Blow me with your lectures.
- Kid, you wearing a wire?

40
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,445
You crazy?

41
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,622
- Pat him down.
- He fucking touches me...

42
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,537
Then make it easy on us all.
Take them off. Everything.

43
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:51,380
New York reopened the books, but
they laid down a probationary period.

44
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,136
When I was coming up,
this would never happen.

45
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,802
- But too many are doing a simulcast.
- Yeah, maybe you, you fuck.

46
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,564
Do me a favor
and don't take it personally.

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,494
- Everything.
- Go fuck yourself.

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,122
Before, I was breaking balls.
Now you're beginning to worry me.

49
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,014
I guess you could call that a dick.

50
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,099
You're going.
That's all there is to it.

51
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,521
- Jason Mangelli isn't going.
- Tony, you want to weigh in here?

52
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,365
Tony?

53
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,532
- What?
- The Washington trip?

54
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,369
You're gonna be
on that bus tomorrow.

55
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,752
You're all packed and paid for
and you're gonna learn.

56
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,206
We're going to FBI headquarters.

57
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,796
So?

58
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,547
Excuse me.

59
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,977
What did you do to this <i>scarole?</i>
It's delicious.

60
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,516
Balsamic.

61
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:35,734
That's all they have at King's these
days. Balsamic, balsamic, balsamic.

62
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,319
My mother never heard of balsamic.

63
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,327
- I gotta go. Problems at work.
- It's Sunday dinner, Tony.

64
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:47,082
I know. I gotta go.
All right, Hugh, see you later.

65
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,505
- Can I be excused too?
- No, you may not.

66
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:58,009
He's got homework to finish
before the trip. Go ahead, Anthony.

67
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,261
- That's a nice example he sets.
- Ma.

68
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,766
The man's got two speeds, moping
or yelling, when he's here.

69
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:13,108
- He's got an uncle sick with cancer.
- They didn't speak for a year.

70
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,529
Actually, if you must know,
Tony has been better.

71
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,577
We've been seeing
his therapist together.

72
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,378
- What?
- He's no Angelo Stamfa, that's all.

73
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,303
- What does that mean?
- Angelo was dying to marry you.

74
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,839
Stamfa's is a chain of drugstores.

75
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,642
He doesn't need therapy?
He prescribes his own pills?

76
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,269
Don't be so sensitive.

77
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,648
What's sensitive?
I gotta hear this Stamfa shit again?

78
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,278
- All I was saying was...
- I know what you're saying.

79
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,787
Hugh, bring your plate.

80
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,622
You are blowing this all out
of proportion. We worry, that's all.

81
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,834
Spare me your concern, all right?
Spare me your attitude too.

82
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:22,345
Did you forget? Dad's mall was zoned
residential until Tony made a call.

83
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,254
- Bullshit.
- Oh, really?

84
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:29,684
That contract at Sparta High? The
other builders were too busy to bid?

85
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:34,314
My heart bleeds. The waters don't
part for you wherever you go?

86
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,023
I earn it. You two get a free pass.

87
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,238
- What's up?
- Hey, Tony.

88
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,640
Anyway, $4 a pound.

89
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:18,525
- Who brought this in here?
- Georgie. It's wacky, huh?

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,700
- You think it's a playroom back there?
- What?

91
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:31,034
Fucking toys. This is a business.
That's an office.

92
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:36,077
- They were selling them at Rite Aid.
- What? What did you say?

93
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,210
<i>L</i> pay you a fucking salary!

94
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,061
Carmela.

95
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,202
You sounded tense on the phone.

96
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,245
Yeah, I...

97
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,045
I wanted to make sure
it was okay if I came alone.

98
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,802
I mean, because Tony couldn't make it.

99
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,263
I love the artwork you have.
Those country scenes.

100
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,144
Thank you.

101
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,065
That statue is not my favorite.

102
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:59,619
It's not like this when Tony's here.
You never give the silent treatment.

103
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:04,631
Is that what you think?
I'm giving you the silent treatment?

104
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,678
You could tell me why you came today.

105
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:15,467
I'm worried about my husband.
The mood swings.

106
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,181
I thought when his mother died,
maybe...

107
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,524
But... still half the time
he doesn't even talk to me.

108
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,941
You've seen him like that,
that day he sat here like a wall.

109
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,862
I know he's your patient
and I'm the patient's wife...

110
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,532
but you try living with that,
see how you feel.

111
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,622
- I see.
- Oh, you do?

112
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,209
For your information,
I am not the only one.

113
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,217
Tony isn't under the weather.
He didn't feel like coming.

114
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,218
"Fuck that shit," he said.

115
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,511
Usually happens
when we touch on a nerve.

116
00:11:55,673 --> 00:12:01,476
He was distressed about this young
man's death in the garbage compactor.

117
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:06,360
See, he didn't say
garbage compactor, did he?

118
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,902
See?

119
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,856
- What do you believe?
- You know his job.

120
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,912
He reports to a strip club.
Who knows how he spends his days?

121
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,423
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.

122
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:41,603
Tony has been out of sorts for so long
and there's nothing I can do to help.

123
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:47,018
I think coming to therapy with him
has stirred feelings in you...

124
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,732
that you would like to address.

125
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,194
Oh, please. I'm just emotional today.

126
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:58,908
I would like to help you, but <i>as</i> you
pointed out, your husband's my patient.

127
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:04,914
I am not the one who needs
mental help. I just needed to vent.

128
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,626
In case you change your mind...

129
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,590
here's the number of
a colleague in Livingston.

130
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
He was a teacher of mine.

131
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,980
That really won't be necessary,
but thank you anyway.

132
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,113
Thank you for your time.

133
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,668
- You took these yourself?
- That's a village I lived in.

134
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,175
<i>You could send them in
to National Geographic.</i>

135
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:59,181
So I got back your complete
surgical pathology and op reports.

136
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,263
- I feel 100%.
- That's good.

137
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:09,183
It's possible though that there may be
some malignant cells we didn't get.

138
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,192
When we operate...

139
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:18,155
we have to decide how much healthy
tissue to cut around the tumor.

140
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:24,323
The margins weren't wide enough.
We took a small sampling of the tumor.

141
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:29,211
When we got back the complete results,
it showed nodal involvement.

142
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,999
Don't blame yourself, doc.
What do we do next?

143
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,302
- It's called amended surgery.
- Oh, Jesus. Cut me again?

144
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,885
<i>- Mrs. Brody is here.
- Don't let me keep you.</i>

145
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,849
I am kind of backed up.

146
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:49,856
Let's schedule you for Tuesday at 6.
We can admit and prep you Monday.

147
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,644
- Any questions?
- When can he eat regular food again?

148
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,021
I'd guess two weeks.

149
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:01,660
Let's fill out the consent forms.
One less thing you have to deal with.

150
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,576
- Take all the time you need.
- You say sign, I sign.

151
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,249
Tell me to crap on the <i>Queen</i> Mary...

152
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:13,005
an hour later, they're hosing
it down. I owe you everything.

153
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,582
How do I know
what nodal involvement is?

154
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,675
Didn't you listen? A whole issue
of U. S. <i>News</i> on seniors and health.

155
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,308
"Take somebody to the doctor's,"
it said. Somebody to ask questions.

156
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,558
You ask one dumb fucking question
about my diet.

157
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,455
- Angie?
- Carmela, hi.

158
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:59,376
- What a surprise.
- I didn't know you shopped over here.

159
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,843
They're running a special on lams.
Every penny counts.

160
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,593
How are you doing, Angie,
with Pussy gone?

161
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,887
I tell you, shopping for one
is no picnic.

162
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,646
Why don't you come for dinner?
It's just me and Tony.

163
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,607
Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky
and Tony won't show.

164
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:28,830
- That's Cocoa's worst time of the day.
- That dog is not a substitute.

165
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,242
That French poodle is
all I got left of Sal.

166
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,628
He disappears one day
and I get a sick dog.

167
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,924
The vet says to put her down,
but I want another operation.

168
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,461
With Sal, there was nothing
too good for that dog.

169
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,973
But where am I gonna come up
with $1200?

170
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:52,638
Tony helps out and I am so grateful.
It covers the basics.

171
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,352
But anything extra, there's no way.

172
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,190
Angie, I'm sorry.
That must be so tough.

173
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,438
<i>I told the wallpaper guy
that this was okay.</i>

174
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,231
<i>Well, why did you do that?</i>

175
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,695
<i>Because I didn't want to deal with
your parents anymore.</i>

176
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,373
Anybody around here love
the word "Jimmy Choo shoes"?

177
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,000
No way.

178
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,211
Oh, my gosh, they're gorgeous!

179
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:27,138
Or would the lady prefer
something in gold?

180
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:32,518
Say a nice, I don't know,
whatever the fuck that is.

181
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,651
They're all yours. They're from next
season. You can't even buy them yet.

182
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,076
- What size are these?
- Ten.

183
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:54,207
Ten? That's Sasquatch size.
I'm a 8 1/2.

184
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,244
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Where'd I get 10 from?

185
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,416
Yeah, where?

186
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,718
So now what happens?
I gotta give them all back?

187
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,219
Temporarily. I'll get you
8 1/2s tomorrow.

188
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,056
- All of them? You swear?
- More even.

189
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:24,279
Since you been, you know, "in,"
I just can't believe the stuff we get.

190
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,071
It's so great.

191
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,077
Except for that Paulie. Fuck him
and the Coupe DeVille he rode in on.

192
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,871
He's saying
you're holding back again?

193
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,911
Like I'm gonna give that prick
a full share? Come here.

194
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,419
What do you say?

195
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,592
- I love you, baby.
- Oh, you fucking better.

196
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,598
- You better.
- I do.

197
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,070
You could've called.
Now everything's cold.

198
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:12,235
That's why they invented microwaves.
For inconsiderate husbands.

199
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,660
Since we're alone, it'd be nice
to have dinner together.

200
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,167
Don't bust my chops.
I got a lot on my mind.

201
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,797
This is fucking delicious. Really.
Is this the pecorino?

202
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,635
Right.

203
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,053
The hell with heating it up,
it's good like this.

204
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,978
I'm glad something brings you joy.

205
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,103
You're amazing, your cooking.

206
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm having lunch with our daughter's
dean. You won't be joining me?

207
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,533
All he wants is our money.
We already shell out 40 grand a year.

208
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,167
It's well spent. She's really
learning. If she passes us by...

209
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,169
If? She did that when she was 14.

210
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,172
Isn't that what you want
for your kids?

211
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,711
No. I want them
to be backwards and ignorant.

212
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:17,058
And I'm gonna make sure of that by
not going to lunch with some asshole.

213
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,516
Fine, Tony. Don't go.

214
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,398
Guess who I ran into
at the supermarket today?

215
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,237
Angie Bonpensiero.

216
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,071
Really?

217
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,869
How's she doing?

218
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,071
Her dog is sick.

219
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,745
What, that ﬂuffy French Cocoa
piece of shit? What's wrong with him?

220
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,416
Her. Osteoporosis.
Angie needs money for an operation.

221
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,215
Take it up with Pussy.

222
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,756
If you can find the fuck,
wherever the Feds put him.

223
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:02,725
I'd look in Arizona. Stake out all the
T.G.l. Friday's. He loves their wings.

224
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:09,277
He left Angie holding the bag. And
those FBI "family values" cocksuckers.

225
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,065
- They let him go without his wife.
- Lnto the program?

226
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,278
That's right. He ratted us out.
Me and you. That's where he is.

227
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,744
I don't want to hear about him
or his cunt wife.

228
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,788
His what wife?

229
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,628
- Okay, who was your oldest?
- Easy. Chuckie Periccio's mother.

230
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:41,598
- You had sex with Beverly Periccio?
- Yeah. A whole summer's worth.

231
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,982
Okay, my turn.
Who was your most famous?

232
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:53,188
And Bobby DiTillio doesn't count.
He's only famous in New Jersey.

233
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,325
You know Penn and Teller,
the magicians?

234
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,780
You fucked them?

235
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,447
Penn. And I didn't fuck him,
I gave him head.

236
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,911
- Which one is he?
- The big one.

237
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,748
They were playing AC
and they're funny.

238
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,255
He followed me into the ladies' room...

239
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,337
You lowlife cunt whore!
Get out of my sight!

240
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,255
- You fucking shitbag motherfucker!
- In the fucking bathroom?

241
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:34,275
- Who is it?
- The FBI. Come on, dickhead, open up.

242
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,525
Paulie, it's 2 in the morning.

243
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:45,290
- It's an outrage. Adriana, you there?
- Yeah?

244
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,202
Sorry for the intrusion.
Put something on and come out.

245
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,336
You can't fucking do this!

246
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,500
I can't? You must have not read up
on the latest rules.

247
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,385
And put that piece away.

248
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,214
What's all this?

249
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,056
The Berezovsky brothers jacked
a shipment from Milan off pier 87.

250
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,848
Nice goods. My broad wears a size 10.

251
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:15,566
Patsy, pack up some of these shoes.
You don't mind if I take my taste now?

252
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,817
He's not taking those.

253
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,577
Make yourselves comfortable.
We'll just have a look around.

254
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,668
<i>- I'll</i> still get more shoes, right?
- Don't know. I have to pay for them.

255
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,928
- This really sucks, Christopher!
- You see the shit I go through?

256
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,895
- Motherfucker.
- What?

257
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,856
Nothing.

258
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,125
Leave it on. It's nice.

259
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,484
Meadow?

260
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,032
- Didn't you hear me knocking?
- I thought it was Vanessa.

261
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,629
You don't answer the door
when friends knock?

262
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,880
They keep you from studying.
My first class isn't until 2.

263
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:48,514
I brought your laundry.
I made ziti with the sweet sausage.

264
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,516
Oh, I'm so starved.

265
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,726
It reeks of cigarettes in here.
Are you smoking?

266
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,232
Caitlin.

267
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:06,699
I hope you're taking advantage of
offers here. A boy handed this to me.

268
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:11,408
"A seminar on the CIA
and the cultural cold war."

269
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,081
Oh, this looks interesting.

270
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:24,091
- It's basic, we're way past that.
- I'm reading Barbara Kingsolver.

271
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,220
I so wish I had time for fiction.

272
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:34,010
So how is the drama queen
doing anyway?

273
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:39,270
- Fine. Can we not talk about this?
- If you want me to leave, I will.

274
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,731
I have an hour before my lunch
with Dean Ross.

275
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,272
- Lunch with the dean?
- Can we not talk about this?

276
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,781
- Mom!
- His secretary called and invited me.

277
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:55,039
- Come on, what about?
- Money, I'm sure.

278
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,369
- They probably want a donation.
- How corrupt.

279
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,756
I wanted to make sure
you're recovered from the Noah thing.

280
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,383
I'm worried it'll affect your grades.

281
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,388
You call losing a wonderful man
because of Dad, a "thing"?

282
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,214
Is that what happened?

283
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,935
You kept seeing him long after
that business with your father.

284
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:22,146
Don't drag me into whatever bullshit
accommodational pretense you've got.

285
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,520
Was that last night's
reading assignment?

286
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,736
All right.

287
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:35,284
Let's hear it. What's your big theory
about me and Daddy?

288
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,824
No way. I'm not touching that.

289
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,026
Fucking bitch!

290
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,317
Uncle Jun, what the hell
are you doing?

291
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,278
Those marshals see you coming in here?

292
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:22,873
Because I need being remanded
to a jail hospital like I need crabs.

293
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:28,170
There's no car out there. And I came
up through the cellar like always.

294
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,131
Where's Bacala?
He's supposed to help.

295
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,797
I sent him to the drugstore
for more Pepto.

296
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:43,389
You're getting better. That's the
important thing. You look better.

297
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,401
If you're gonna lie, tell me
there's a broad in the car.

298
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,563
You want that,
it's a phone call away.

299
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,702
- Still want this?
- I gotta get nutrition somehow.

300
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,115
Kennedy says eat only
what I can sip through a straw.

301
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,004
What's going on with you
and Ralphie Cifaretto?

302
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:18,637
You don't got enough on your plate?
Worry about your own problems.

303
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,177
When can you eat real food?

304
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,936
Who knows? Kennedy's putting me
under the knife again.

305
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:31,400
Back up. More surgery?
Shouldn't you get a second opinion?

306
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,359
Chemo? Forget it.

307
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:38,449
With Kennedy, it's cut, zip, over and
out. He has the hands of an angel.

308
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,199
Don't forget his name.

309
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,866
I have to be impressed
because his name's John Kennedy?

310
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:48,082
All the micks named their kids that
after the guy got killed.

311
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,667
I loved that man.

312
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,842
He was older than me and now look.

313
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,463
How many White Castles did you have?

314
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:01,559
- I didn't, I swear.
- I can smell them!

315
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,938
Let me call Cusamano.
He knows doctors.

316
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,729
He sent Silvio's mother to one.
It can't hurt.

317
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,814
- People come from the city see Kennedy.
- Then we won't be fighting traffic.

318
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,993
Come on, Uncle Jun,
you know I'm right.

319
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,915
All right, you set it up.
You come with me.

320
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,498
To listen and ask questions.

321
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:34,755
Good, good. I'll let you know,
all right? All right.

322
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,096
He thinks I need a second opinion.

323
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,687
He doesn't like that
I'm going back under the knife.

324
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,946
- Maybe there's something to that.
- Another expert. Think on this.

325
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:02,369
Anthony is a cunt-hair away from owning
all of Northern Jersey. I'm that hair.

326
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,873
Maybe he has something else on
his mind besides my speedy recovery.

327
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,372
Junior, all this cynicism,
this can't be good for you.

328
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,140
- You speak Italian.
- Second generation.

329
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,347
- Really? Ross?
- Rosetti.

330
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,893
A thousand years of a proud name
undone at Ellis Island.

331
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,148
A <i>paesan.</i>

332
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,561
- Not far from you. New Brunswick.
- No, get out!

333
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,527
My success, I credit
to the Jersey public schools.

334
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,200
- Where did you go to college?
- Rutgers.

335
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,201
- I went to Montclair State.
- Good school. Your major?

336
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,832
Business administration.

337
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,915
To Meadow Soprano,
a valuable addition to Columbia.

338
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,831
- Really?
- Absolutely.

339
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,758
I've talked to her professors.

340
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:04,595
They say she does all her work
and makes insightful contributions.

341
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,395
I am glad to hear you say that.
I was worried about her adjusting.

342
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,724
Let's not tell her.
We don't want her overconfident.

343
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,360
- She sleeps an awful lot.
- They all do.

344
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,338
Tony, what the hell?

345
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:51,096
You know, driving over here, I was
thinking about how to handle this.

346
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:57,811
Been working on my anger lately, so I
figure it's good if I quietly say...

347
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,982
any kind of problem you got,
you come directly to me.

348
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,778
Please. Leave Carmela
the fuck out of it.

349
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,413
- Of course.
- Then I saw the Cadillac.

350
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,582
The money I give you, you're driving
a Cadillac and you want more?

351
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,296
Shot the whole plan.

352
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,382
So remember this:

353
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,812
You see my wife, you talk about oven
cleaner. Anything else, come to me.

354
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,435
But think twice before you do.

355
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:42,526
Think about your fat-fuck husband
and what he did to you. Him, not me.

356
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,868
Cocoa, please. Cocoa, down!

357
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,195
Hey, how are you?

358
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,994
I'm sorry, Tony.
Just push her away.

359
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:57,374
She's all right. Good girl, good girl.

360
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:03,922
- She don't look sick.
- It comes and goes.

361
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,386
Your kids don't feel boxed in
by the city?

362
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,304
We're out all the time.
Felicia has us all into kayaking.

363
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,521
- You do it together?
- Yeah.

364
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,817
The kids love it.
They're better at it than I am.

365
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,145
- More wine?
- Why not?

366
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,403
Remember I said I spend half
my time with student affairs?

367
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:31,196
- This is how I spend the other half.
- At lunch?

368
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,079
Development.

369
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,663
Fancy word for fund raising.

370
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,912
New student center.
We break ground in the fall.

371
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,086
- See the marble wall by the entrance?
- Yes.

372
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,925
- That's where the donor names will go.
- Everybody who donates?

373
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,389
The wall is reserved for those
whose commitment begins at $50,000.

374
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,517
It's what we felt
you'd be comfortable with.

375
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,857
Based on your generosity
to the Verbum Dei School.

376
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,435
You know what
we gave to Verbum Dei?

377
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,776
I'm half-embarrassed to say it,
but it's my job.

378
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:12,870
All the information,
including tax benefits, is in here.

379
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,622
I will have to talk to my husband.

380
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,785
Fifty grand?
You gotta be kidding me.

381
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:24,373
He talked a lot about Meadow
having the best possible experience.

382
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,964
- Those Jews are holding her hostage.
- He's Italian.

383
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,878
Jews with better food.

384
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,056
They know from Verbum
we're big givers.

385
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,468
We gave 5 grand a year.
That's a long way from 50.

386
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,811
This is college, Tony.
Five thousand is a slap in the face.

387
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,563
Well, let them say no.

388
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,818
Here.

389
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,448
It's around 5 grand.

390
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:04,005
Run it through your household account.
And that's it. Not a penny more.

391
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:14,299
5-FU with cisplatin and doxorubicin.
This is what I would recommend.

392
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,138
Are you getting this?

393
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:24,187
Sort of. So the chemotherapy
would be instead of the surgery?

394
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,944
I can't guarantee it.
We'll evaluate the results.

395
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,694
I could end up having the chemo,
puking my guts out...

396
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,986
having the six hairs I have left
fall out and still be cut.

397
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,369
It's possible.

398
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,365
With Kennedy,
you don't get these maybes.

399
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,082
- But you gotta have surgery.
- Kennedy's a great surgeon.

400
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,037
Can't you people agree?

401
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,378
- Sure. Convene a tumor board.
- What's that?

402
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,883
A meeting of the chief of oncology,
pathologists and specialists...

403
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,719
who work together
to reach a consensus.

404
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:02,513
- Then you hear what they have to say.
- Your uncle will not be present.

405
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:07,648
They'll pass their decision to you.
What you do is still your decision.

406
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,863
- And Kennedy will be there?
- No surgeon would miss it.

407
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,405
Not much to him, if you ask me.

408
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,073
Oh, you mean he's not Kennedy?

409
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,742
You make life and death decisions
because of a man's name?

410
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:27,879
It's only Sloan-fucking-Kettering,
best cancer hospital in the world.

411
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,039
Excuse me.

412
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:40,509
Let me ask you something
about this JFK worship of yours.

413
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,020
What about Hoffa
and the Teamsters?

414
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,648
That was the brother.

415
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,696
Dr. Krakower?

416
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:03,787
Hi. Thanks for calling me back.
I was referred by a Dr. Melfi.

417
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,373
Yes, I would.
Anytime that's good for you.

418
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:13,133
That's great. That's fine.
Grove Avenue, right. I gotta go. Bye.

419
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,795
Who was that?

420
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,966
The paving guy. I'm thinking
of having the driveway redone.

421
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,978
- You smoking?
- What is this, the third degree?

422
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,557
- This says "with pulp."
- You like it with pulp.

423
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:33,654
Not this much. I like the one
that says "some pulp."

424
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,235
- What the fuck was that for?
<i>- I'll</i> write you up a list.

425
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:50,671
Hi. Oh, honey, I missed you so much!

426
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,093
This is the longest we have ever
been away from each other.

427
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,096
- Did you miss me?
- Sure.

428
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,137
Did somebody drop this?

429
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,353
Well? How was it?

430
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,142
Good. They had PlayStation 2
in the hotel room.

431
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,025
And?

432
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,324
That was the total of your trip
to the nation's capital?

433
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,984
I guess.

434
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,712
I'm sorry. The orange juice is fine.
Whatever kind is fine.

435
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:38,503
- Fuck the orange juice.
- I give up. What then?

436
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:44,724
The money you give to Angie and other
widows you've got on your payroll...

437
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,351
It's a business expense!

438
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:50,852
But there's not enough to make sure
your daughter is protected?

439
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:55,315
I won't pay. I know too much
about extortion.

440
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,406
Big deal, he pats you down.

441
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,911
I could do that standing on my head.
It's everything else.

442
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,370
He came to my apartment and
embarrassed me in front of Adriana.

443
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,997
I heard he strip-searched you.

444
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,883
I'm not kidding. He's a sick fuck.
He was sniffing her panties.

445
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,260
- What?
- You heard me.

446
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,887
I don't deny that Paulie can be
a little quirky. He always has.

447
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,683
You're moving up fast.
Why do you think that is?

448
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:40,197
- Because I'm your nephew?
- So be a big boy and suck it up.

449
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:48,697
Soprano, Corrado.
Male, caucasian, <i>72</i> years old.

450
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,039
Presented with severe weight loss
and early satiety.

451
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:57,957
He was scoped and a mass in the
curvature of his stomach was detected.

452
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,628
A CT scan revealed no evidence of
metastasis. Kennedy was referred.

453
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,638
He recommended gastric resection
for cure.

454
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,762
There were no surprises.
I thought we had it.

455
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,474
I was told we had clean margins.

456
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,732
Often, too little healthy tissue is
taken around the site...

457
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,269
which leaves the possibility
for a false negative.

458
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,108
You want the whole stomach?

459
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,992
If there's a problem, we'll take it
to the board. What do we do?

460
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,951
He's high-risk. His pressure fell
below 60 for eight minutes.

461
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,658
Incision's fresh.
I can do it in half the time.

462
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,791
- If we don't do surgery, we do 5-FU.
- Which works how well?

463
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,256
- Not very.
- Which is why we decided to go in.

464
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,844
- What do I tell Mehta?
- Mehta? Sloan-Kettering Mehta?

465
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,180
Your patient sought a second opinion.

466
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:57,190
Forget it then. I don't need that shit
looking over my shoulder.

467
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:02,863
I'll tell him.
Yes, I'll have him there. Thanks.

468
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,192
Don't sugarcoat it!

469
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,284
If you concentrate on your breathing,
it'll be easier.

470
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:16,042
The girl said she'd page Dr. Kennedy.
Where is he?

471
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,875
Twenty minutes and I'll be back.

472
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,224
- You go too easy on him.
- Probably.

473
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:37,648
Hey, if my nephew Cubby wasn't dead,
I'd have a soft spot for him.

474
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,355
Did you sniff that girl's panties?

475
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,397
He told you that? Fucking baby!

476
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,739
- You got to apologize.
- I'm not apologizing to him.

477
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,367
You were out of line.
He's gonna marry the girl.

478
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:59,002
As of the wedding day, anything that
touches her pussy is off-limits.

479
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,052
Think it's all up?

480
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,013
Soon enough there'll be more
where that came from.

481
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,097
Sounds like you were going
at it in there.

482
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,442
My pain a source of entertainment?

483
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,573
You see me laughing? Brought you
a milk shake from 31 Flavors.

484
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:34,079
It's your fault. I've been throwing up
all day since I started the chemo.

485
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,873
Oh, right. I gave you cancer.

486
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:43,539
You don't know what this is like,
Anthony. I can't do it.

487
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,379
- Kennedy was right.
- What's he gotta say?

488
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,136
I can't get him.
They won't put me through.

489
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,470
Why not?

490
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,806
I leave messages at the hospital and
office. I sent him a box of cigars.

491
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,141
I couldn't get past reception.

492
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,977
- He didn't call?
- Do they even tell him?

493
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,485
The machine says
for an emergency, press 6.

494
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:11,776
I press 6. Still no callback
24 hours later. He must be busy.

495
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,070
Yeah, that must be it.

496
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,658
You got his number?

497
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:30,044
Three more weeks.
Three more fucking weeks.

498
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,675
Answering machine.

499
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,599
What are you gonna do?
These doctors, it's not like on TV.

500
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:46,151
Dr. Kennedy, this is Tony Soprano,
Corrado's nephew.

501
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:50,359
My cell phone is 917-555-0157.

502
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:56,369
Call me back anytime day or night.
It's important.

503
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,198
Batter up.

504
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,879
Bye.

505
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,904
- Now what?
- Get in.

506
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,499
You're not even married yet,
you're dipping into whores.

507
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:51,166
Didn't cost me a quarter.
I don't pay for it.

508
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,010
How'd you find me?

509
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:59,265
Better be careful. If I can do it,
so can your bride-to-be.

510
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:04,013
What is this? Some new rule about
who I fuck? You want more shoes?

511
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:11,149
No. They don't fit her. I don't know
why I thought she was a size 10.

512
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,610
- I don't know either.
- I'm here to tell you one thing.

513
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,620
You go whining to the Big Man again
about shit between us...

514
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,702
we'll have a problem, my friend.

515
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,053
You seen these?

516
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,809
Fuck is that?

517
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:47,598
My godson got it for me.
They're all over the place.

518
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,983
We gotta bring one into the club.

519
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,756
Watch and learn, Phil.
Watch and learn.

520
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,770
- What are you doing?
- It's me, Tony. Corrado's nephew.

521
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,775
You belong to this club?

522
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:39,441
- Me? No. I came here to see you.
- You'll have to call my office.

523
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,495
You need a new secretary.
You're not getting all your messages.

524
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,619
For you.

525
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:52,333
Titanium. I use one.
Added 10 yards to my drives.

526
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:57,667
- Thanks, but I can't accept it.
- For what you've done for my uncle.

527
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:03,511
I already got one
and Mr. Williams here, he don't play.

528
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,764
- Right?
- Stupid fucking game.

529
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,390
- What can I do with it?
- What is it, Jack?

530
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,274
He'll just be a minute!

531
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:23,743
- I could use a little extra distance.
- Who couldn't?

532
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,490
My uncle's not doing so well.
Bad reaction to the chemo.

533
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,913
That happens.
There's nothing that I can do.

534
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,665
There are worse things that
can happen to a person than cancer.

535
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,758
My uncle thinks he's gonna die.

536
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,592
You know how old people are
with their superstitions.

537
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,099
He thinks it's because
he went against you.

538
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,232
I was his surgeon, that's all.

539
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,106
You got a bee on your hat.

540
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:07,871
Show that man the respect he deserves.

541
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,120
Answer his phone calls.

542
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:26,347
Cheryl, make sure
Mr. Soprano is scheduled for...

543
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,925
Just remember it.

544
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,405
- Everybody's marriage has problems.
- Is he seeing another woman?

545
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,864
You can make that plural.
He sees other women.

546
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,862
I look the other way.
I want to help him.

547
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,290
Do you? Moments ago
you used the word "divorce."

548
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:57,462
I said I was considering divorce.

549
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,421
I may be overstepping my boundaries,
but aren't you Jewish?

550
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,878
Is that relevant?

551
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:11,013
Us Catholics place a great deal of
stock in the sanctity of the family.

552
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:16,306
- And I'm not sure that your people...
- I've been married for 31 years.

553
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:21,145
Well, then you know
how difficult it can be.

554
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,859
He's a good man, he's a good father.

555
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:30,825
You said he's a depressed criminal,
prone to anger, serially unfaithful.

556
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,490
Is that your definition
of a "good man"?

557
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,956
I thought psychiatrists
weren't judgmental.

558
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,672
Patients want to be excused
from their predicament...

559
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,004
because of events
in their childhood.

560
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,509
That's what psychiatry
has become in America.

561
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:55,429
Visit any shopping mall or ethnic
pride parade to witness the results.

562
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:02,227
- What we say in here stays in here?
- By ethical code and by law.

563
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,528
His crimes...

564
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,575
they are organized crime.

565
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,577
The Mafia?

566
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,863
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

567
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:21,045
Oh, so what? So what?

568
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,377
He betrays me every week
with these whores.

569
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:28,086
Probably the least of his misdeeds.

570
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:33,967
You can leave now or you can stay
and hear what I have to say.

571
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:40,064
- You'll charge the same.
- I won't take your money.

572
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,481
That's a new one.

573
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:46,355
You must trust your initial impulse
and consider leaving him.

574
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,023
You'll never be able to feel good.

575
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:55,697
You'll never be able to quell
the feelings of guilt and shame...

576
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,582
as long as
you're his accomplice.

577
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:02,120
- You're wrong about the accomplice.
- Are you sure?

578
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,587
All I do is make sure
he's got clean clothes and dinner.

579
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,637
So "enabler" would be a more accurate
job description than "accomplice."

580
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,423
My apologies.

581
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:23,642
So you think I need to define
my boundaries more clearly...

582
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,152
keep a certain distance,
not internalize my...

583
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,279
What did I just say?

584
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,491
Leave him.

585
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,996
Take only the children,
what's left of them, and go.

586
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,829
My priest said I should try
and help him to be better.

587
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,539
How's that going?

588
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:52,671
<i>Have</i> you read <i>Crime and Punishment?
Dostoyevsky?</i>

589
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:57,058
It's not an easy read,
it's about guilt and redemption.

590
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,975
And I think, were your husband
to turn himself in, read this book...

591
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:08,440
reflect on his crimes for 7 years
in his cell, he might be redeemed.

592
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,989
I would have to get a lawyer...

593
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:16,368
find an apartment,
arrange for child support...

594
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,159
You're not listening.

595
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,867
I'm not charging you
because I won't take blood money.

596
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,877
And you can't either.

597
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,382
One thing you can never say:

598
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,007
That you haven't been told.

599
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,844
I see.

600
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,301
You're right. I see.

601
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:49,106
You're poisoning me.
I don't know how much more I can take.

602
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,688
- You taking care of this young man?
- Dr. Kennedy!

603
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,196
How you doing?
I've been busy. You all right?

604
00:53:56,567 --> 00:54:01,619
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
Will this work? Or should we operate?

605
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,745
- You got a top guy here.
- Him?

606
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,586
- I'd see him if I needed to.
- Son of a bitch.

607
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,874
Stay strong and keep fighting.

608
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,839
That's my home number.
You start to feel punk, you call.

609
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,337
Thanks.

610
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,134
I'll check on you Wednesday.
Take care of this young fellow.

611
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,875
- Carm.
- What?

612
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,546
You sick?

613
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:55,460
Everybody else in this family sleeps
all day, I thought I'd try it.

614
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,636
You...

615
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,880
depressed?

616
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,549
Or what?

617
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:07,142
I figure in the division of labor
around here, that's your job.

618
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:28,744
Because, you know, if you want to go
to therapy on your own or something...

619
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,796
I notice you been tense lately.

620
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:37,631
That's rich.
You suggesting I go to a shrink.

621
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,093
I don't have the time.

622
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,017
I'll still go to yours, if you want.

623
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,610
You know best.

624
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,857
- That dean called today.
- Well, that can't be good.

625
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,114
I told him to put us down
for the 50,000.

626
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:06,156
Carmela, I gave you 5.

627
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:11,669
Maybe I could go another 5.
Maybe 10, but that's enough.

628
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,794
Tony, you gotta do
something nice for me today.

629
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,555
And this is what I want.
You gotta do this.

630
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:28,886
All right, I'll go to 10.
That should be enough for them.

631
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,564
I already told him 50.

632
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,198
- 50 G's?
- Yes.

633
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:05,260
You look like you could use
a night off from cooking.

634
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,349
What do you say we go out?
