2
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,321
I gotta pee.

3
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,785
The janitor leaves at 8.
You can wait 10 minutes.

4
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,965
Now I gotta pee.

5
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,645
Got it.

6
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,830
This is the kid I told you about.
He needs to crash.

7
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,998
He can get you a Glock 9.

8
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,169
Welcome to the Boonton Holiday Inn.

9
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,346
My name is Leena.
What's your name?

10
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,222
- I probably shouldn't say.
- Mr. X, then.

11
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:05,687
You'll be safe. Your Guido friends
would never look for you here.

12
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,031
How do I open this door?

13
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,966
Did you like the room?
Did you think it was nice?

14
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,881
That's Sammy Kahn.
That's one of my favorites.

15
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,427
I'll have the deposit to you,
end of the week.

16
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,560
If you could transfer...

17
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,730
We have a bigger sing
on Parisian Night, on Fridays.

18
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,275
Oh, Madonna mia,
they don't eat snails, do they?

19
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,696
<i>No. Coq au vin, blanquette of veal...</i>

20
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,953
Ma? What's the matter?

21
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:06,248
My son lets me live in a place
like this. He's such a good boy.

22
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,466
Yeah, well, who's the queen, eh?

23
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,093
Come on, now, dry those peeps.

24
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,639
Listen to this. 19-year-old kid.

25
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,354
He's coming out for the NBA draft
as a sophomore.

26
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,560
He's dead. From crack.

27
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,573
I was thinking about Ro.

28
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,200
Jackie convinced her
he was just smoking marijuana...

29
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,618
making C's in school.

30
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,459
And he was dealing hard drugs.

31
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,003
- You never know with your kids.
- It's like I said.

32
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,171
Shit happens over drug money.

33
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,725
Well, you tried, Tony, with that boy.

34
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:08,192
Nice haul, cracking that strongbox.
Almost 100 K.

35
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,980
Where's my half? Fucking week now.

36
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,731
Well, let's see.

37
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,527
- After you kick up, you'll net...
- You my accountant?

38
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,662
I'm better than nine-tenths
of your accountants.

39
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,991
You're in arrears
in the respect department.

40
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,376
- What?
- Your future stepson.

41
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,334
Card game?
He pissed on your leg.

42
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,382
Killed your dealer,
shot at made guys.

43
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,421
You're talking shit
that's none of your business.

44
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm gonna give that little fuck
ammazzare he'll never forget.

45
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,518
- Soon as we locate him.
- He's in a housing project in Boonton!

46
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,019
So this 50 G's,
you think you deserve it?

47
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,281
Deserve, lo cazzo. It's my territory.

48
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,116
- What?
- It's me.

49
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,202
Uh... Tony.

50
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,246
Tony.

51
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,875
Tony, what is it?

52
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,711
It's really Vito. You said to call.

53
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:18,175
No, no, no. I'm not doing
nothing important right now.

54
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,803
I'm watching a guy clean his
windshield. He's got a green hat on.

55
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,436
It's that big?

56
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,432
Some birds up ahead flying.

57
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,653
Some weeds across the street.

58
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,108
Well...

59
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,444
- I can be there in a half-hour.
- I think I see a rabbit.

60
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,738
I don't know what it is.

61
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,618
- Maybe it's a possum.
- No, I'll see you then.

62
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,587
Well, what can I do?

63
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,502
To be continued.
Tony needs me.

64
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,262
We'll work this out another time.

65
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,934
Hello?

66
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,599
<i>Tony? It's me.</i>

67
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,357
- You shouldn't call me here.
- What <i>else</i> am <i>I gonna</i> do?

68
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,526
- Don't say nothing.
- You gotta help me.

69
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,614
- Talk to your stepfather.
- I can't talk to him.

70
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,499
- Look, I'm in the...
- I don't wanna know.

71
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,288
Call him, tell him to get you,
help you, whatever.

72
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,502
Tony, please. I'm sorry.

73
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,168
Don't hang up.
For my dad, if not me.

74
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,132
He's been dead two years.

75
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,798
The expiration date on your bullshit
was last week.

76
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,639
When you did the same,
you got forgiven.

77
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,520
Think about it. There's a difference.

78
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,063
<i>Don't call me.</i>

79
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,194
Mr. X, can you play chess?

80
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,991
No.

81
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,153
I can. My daddy taught me.

82
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,852
Economic downturn,
that's all you hear. But not you.

83
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,517
You got 300 G's of Esplanade green
grass being chauffeured home.

84
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,686
Yeah. Good job.

85
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,111
Jackie Jr. call you?

86
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,363
- No, why?
- He called me.

87
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,704
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

88
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,210
I told him to take it up with you.

89
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,872
Ton, what do you want me to do?
You're the boss...

90
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,714
We talked about this.
You were gonna give him a <i>pass.</i>

91
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,878
But he should know.

92
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,133
You don't want to create
confusion, insubordination.

93
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:16,098
But more important than the decision,
is that it happen in a timely fashion.

94
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,773
But, fuck. Why am I telling you?
You know all this. You're a captain.

95
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,910
Chain of command
is very important in our thing.

96
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,993
- I'm sorry he called.
- Don't apologize.

97
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:52,760
Imagine. Neither of you ever got a
passing grade on any geometry test...

98
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,145
and then the midterm.

99
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,933
Sister Agnes shared these with me.

100
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,979
Both of you got 96 percent correct.
Remarkable.

101
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,276
I'd like to call your parents
and share the news.

102
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,945
Oh, you really don't have to.

103
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,417
What do you want to tell me?

104
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,966
If you cooperate now,
it'll be easier later.

105
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,798
All we did was study hard.

106
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,352
I don't have to waste my time
with you.

107
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,232
It was your urines Mr. Lubimov
spent hours scrubbing.

108
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,272
- Your DNA was an exact match.
- Oh, jeez!

109
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,823
He peed first! I didn't even
have to pee till he did it!

110
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,156
I could take another test,
you could watch.

111
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,495
- He's back.
- Junior Soprano beat cancer?

112
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,833
- As far as anyone can tell.
- This prick is laughing at us.

113
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,175
- We get another crack at him?
- Judge sets a trial date in 30 days.

114
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,585
Good.

115
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,421
Tony?

116
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,464
We had the lamp problem.

117
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,262
Can't we use the nephew?
He's been made.

118
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,935
What about what we did with Banners?

119
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,600
Moltisanti is engaged. To a lovely
thing called Adriana La Cerva.

120
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,480
Good.

121
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,025
Would you ask Deborah
to come in, please?

122
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,949
May I point out, all she's
done is background checks.

123
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,860
Where'd you start?

124
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,034
Deborah.

125
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:46,124
How would you like a new best
friend for the next nine, 10 months?

126
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,549
Ahhh.

127
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,055
How big can you make your hair?

128
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,232
No! Your pawn can only move
two spaces on the first move.

129
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,942
Sorry.

130
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,398
There.

131
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,616
- You're done for.
- We just started.

132
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,154
Yeah, but the way
she's developing her knights...

133
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,580
I win again.

134
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,338
You should've played that out.

135
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,253
That's the only way you gonna learn.

136
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,670
I'm going to the park. To see Bruce.
You guys need anything?

137
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,588
No, I'm cool.

138
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,096
What are you laughing at?

139
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
How could it be $3200?

140
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,349
He said the transmission
was completely compromised.

141
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,636
I never heard of that.
I want my guy to look.

142
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,148
- I told him to go ahead.
- Call him back, tell him not to.

143
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,106
Tell him we're picking up the car.

144
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,985
Forget it, let him do it.

145
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,745
<i>- You're</i> sure?
<i>- What the fuck did I say?</i>

146
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,368
Look, Ro.

147
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,747
I'm coming home late.
I got some shit I gotta do.

148
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,885
<i>The Super Bowl returns...</i>

149
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,935
How much? A dime? You got it.

150
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,240
We're writing a lot of slips
on this game.

151
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,868
I'm going to the betting parlor.

152
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,889
I dreamt of that Lo Mein
all the way over here.

153
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,222
Now, who came in here
and ate my shit?!

154
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,906
Not for nothing, T, but I think
you been wound a little tight lately.

155
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,909
- It's Ralphie.
- That's what we got to talk about.

156
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,997
He didn't pay the 50 G's he owes me
out of that check cashing store.

157
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,831
- You lost me.
- I got an alarm guy I pay.

158
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,921
I tip Ralphie's guys about the safe.
Gave them the codes.

159
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,088
So Ralphie says the dough is his.

160
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,261
- I'll talk to him.
- Fuck that.

161
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,518
I told you this guy's no good.

162
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,683
I need the money for my planning.
I want a sit-down.

163
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,516
All right. Answer the fucking phone.

164
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,113
Hello? Yeah.

165
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,609
Carmela.

166
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,323
Sounds like she's crying.

167
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,966
Yeah?

168
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,797
What?!

169
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,306
A permanent expulsion.
I prayed I would never see this.

170
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,140
Even I got through school
without getting expelled.

171
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,348
- Maybe it's a blessing.
- I don't see how.

172
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,984
- The place was too easy.
- What? I got expelled.

173
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,397
You got nothing to say
unless I ask a question!

174
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,860
Tony.

175
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,530
I work hard all day to pay for this
house, big-screen TVs, food...

176
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,081
video games, all kinds of scooters
and bicycles, Columbia University...

177
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,414
and for what?
To come home to this?!

178
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,332
Sucks to be you.

179
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,928
My God, Tony!

180
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,845
There's more where that came from!

181
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,761
The counselor said it
was a cry for help.

182
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,020
Come on!

183
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,901
She recommended a school.
They have a psychologist on staff.

184
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,189
- No. He's going to military school.
- What?

185
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,359
- I got brochures.
- You got school brochures?

186
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,621
From Janice. She was gonna
send Harpo, but it was too late!

187
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,200
- I'm not sending him away.
- We're looking at those brochures!

188
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,044
What is with you, Tony?

189
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,752
"Highly-structured environment."

190
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,886
Which one is that?

191
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:33,561
H.M.l. Hudson Military Institute.
"Our Second Century of Excellence."

192
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,563
- I never said I'd go.
- We're just looking.

193
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,067
We're looking, and then you're going.

194
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,159
- Here.
- Hello?

195
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,736
Yes?

196
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,995
Oh, hi, Marie.

197
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,115
No.

198
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,082
Oh, my God.

199
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,921
- Where's Rosalie?
- She's right here.

200
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,179
- She can't come to the phone.
- I'll <i>come</i> as soon as <i>I</i> can.

201
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,430
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

202
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:18,815
Jackie Jr. was shot to death. At the
Boonton projects. By drug dealers.

203
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,109
I'm going over to Rosalie's.

204
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,952
You see?

205
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,632
- Taco Bell.
<i>- Hi.</i>

206
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,798
- Hey.
- There's something I gotta tell you.

207
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,308
<i>- I heard.
- How?</i>

208
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,721
Like Mom's not gonna tell me
you got expelled?

209
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,475
Not that.

210
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,818
<i>- I heard you copped to everything.
Whey had my DNA.</i>

211
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,071
Moron. it takes six weeks
to get DNA tests.

212
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,481
Shit.

213
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,825
- I gotta <i>go.
- I didn't tell you yet.</i>

214
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,406
- What?
- Jackie.

215
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,494
He was doing a deal
with some black dudes. They shot him.

216
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,326
<i>He's, like, dead.</i>

217
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,347
22 years old,
living in a housing project.

218
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,593
Imagine the shame for the family.

219
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:46,068
Fortunately, they were no longer
boyfriend and girlfriend.

220
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,356
- How's your daughter taking it?
- Not well.

221
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,532
You certainly saw it coming
with this boy, didn't you?

222
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,415
In the end, I failed him.

223
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,711
What the fuck you gonna do?
World today...

224
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,214
One thing. I won't make
the same mistake with A.J.

225
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,298
He got expelled.
Him we're sending to military school.

226
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,555
We never discussed exactly
what you want for your children.

227
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,558
I don't want their faces blown off.

228
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,270
You went into your father's business.

229
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,392
I didn't have a choice.

230
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,483
I try to give my kids
every opportunity.

231
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,240
Meadow's going to Columbia,
for chrissakes.

232
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,404
Wants to be some kind
of a professional woman.

233
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,414
- Like you.
- A psychiatrist?

234
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,043
And have to listen to guys like me
whine all day'?

235
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,915
She mentioned being
a pediatrician once.

236
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,923
- You'd like that?
- I would like something like that.

237
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,680
But the important thing
is she get far away from me.

238
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,095
I mean, she could live close.

239
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,639
I think I understand.

240
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,558
- And your son?
- A.J.?

241
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,362
In my business? Forget it.

242
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,779
He'd never make it.

243
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,291
Your father and I have to drive A.J.
up to Hudson Institute.

244
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,953
I'd feel much better if you were up.

245
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,333
Jackie's dead, and you perseverate
on secondary schools?

246
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,805
I was up half the night with Ro.

247
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:43,186
This morning her sister and I made
all the funeral arrangements.

248
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,479
A.J. doesn't have a school.

249
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,644
He can't chat all day on the Web
with the other dropouts and flakes.

250
00:21:55,105 --> 00:22:01,488
You know, he's the first person
my own age that I knew that ever died.

251
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,711
Well, he knew all the risks involved.

252
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,837
What, the X?

253
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,418
Half the kids I know take it.
They get it from someone.

254
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,256
- It's not a thing you get killed over.
- Except he did.

255
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,515
- Or not.
- Meaning?

256
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,436
Look at who he grew up with.

257
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,186
Look at who his father was.
Look at everyone we know.

258
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:34,400
- Let's not get cute.
- When I'm being cute, I'll tell you.

259
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,580
You liked Jackie, so you won't
believe it was his fault.

260
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:49,710
So, like others, you look for bogeymen
with Italian names to blame.

261
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,966
So whatever you're thinking, stop,
because that is not what happened.

262
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,064
- Stealing an exam is a personal defeat.
- It was wrong.

263
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,608
That sounds pre-programmed.

264
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,316
Is that how you saw your future self?
A cheat?

265
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,732
- No.
- How do you explain it?

266
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,488
There's, like, academic pressure.
About getting into college.

267
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,118
<i>They're obsessed.</i>

268
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,502
With "like, academic pressure"?
Or academic pressure?

269
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,626
There's all this pressure.
My parents too.

270
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,635
My sister goes to Columbia
and my parents expect me to go.

271
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,513
That's "stinking thinking."
Like with an alcoholic.

272
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,434
- No one makes him drink.
- I'm not an alcoholic.

273
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:50,764
How do we do things differently
than at your former school?

274
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,308
- I don't know.
- I realize that.

275
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,101
I'm about to tell you.

276
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,022
At your school, and it's not
a bad one, you're right...

277
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,780
there's too much emphasis
on what's good for you, John and Jane.

278
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:08,790
Here, the higher good is of the Corps.
As Gen. MacArthur said:

279
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,118
"The Corps, the Corps, the Corps."

280
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,540
Now, how do we achieve this
revolution in thinking on your part?

281
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,048
Cadet Corps has first call
0530 each day...

282
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,131
march to first mess 0620...

283
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,222
dorm inspection 0700,
classes 0800 to 1440.

284
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:34,516
Athletic formation 1500,
except Thursdays, which is drill.

285
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:39,904
1900 to 2100 is evening study time.
Taps, lights out 2200.

286
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,066
What's missing? Give up?
Television.

287
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,705
- What's "0530" mean?
- 5:30 a.m.

288
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,165
I outlined a blueprint
for self-discipline...

289
00:24:55,327 --> 00:25:00,003
that would take you through
your life, and that's your question?

290
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:08,391
Why do guys in the Army, or spies,
use that "0" thing when they tell time?

291
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,722
That'll be made abundantly clear.

292
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,230
Keep it simple.

293
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,611
Captain Delaunay?

294
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,948
Give Mr. Soprano the T.O.l.
while I meet his parents.

295
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,859
Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,806
I think Anthony could greatly
benefit from our program...

297
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,594
which, as I candidly told him,
is very rigorous.

298
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,936
Do you mind?

299
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:02,570
I'll be very frank with you. I do not
agree with this hard-nosed discipline.

300
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,106
The mothers seldom do.

301
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,782
Wait till he starts
opening doors for you.

302
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,993
Now, that would be a miracle.

303
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,160
What about creativity?
Independent thought?

304
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,088
I stressed heavily
notions of duty and groupthink.

305
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:26,252
But I didn't mention the Army's motto
Be an Army of One.

306
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,763
Why be an army at all?
How about a veterinarian?

307
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,674
Isn't there enough war?

308
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:36,934
- Amputees? Horrible displaced...
- He's just gonna march a little bit.

309
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,600
Don't get hung up on marching.
It's part of it...

310
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:47,115
but it's nothing compared to
the mentoring and faculty involvement.

311
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,274
Well, that sounds wonderful.

312
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,617
We've created too many options
for our kids. They're confused.

313
00:26:53,779 --> 00:27:00,287
When things go wrong, we fob them off
onto the substance-recovery industry.

314
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:06,634
This "army of one" thing. What happens
when each army of one decides:

315
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,511
"Fuck it, I won't go
over the foxhole"?

316
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,675
Or, "Let's shoot the lieutenant"?
Because they been told...

317
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,890
you know,
"You're an army of one."

318
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,350
<i>Audra Murphy was an army of one.</i>

319
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,357
We're preparing him
for a military career?

320
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,859
No. No.

321
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,232
One day at a time.

322
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:31,317
- You want to train him to be a killer?
- Will you stop? They're soldiers.

323
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:36,034
- The Army hardly ever goes to war!
- They were marching with rifles!

324
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,826
- They're symbolic!
- Symbolic of what?

325
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,585
Respect!

326
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:47,003
He will be disciplined by kids
hardly older than himself.

327
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,552
Boys his age still kill frogs
and small animals.

328
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:55,223
The Cusamanos' Binky? The bomb
with nails, you think it was A.J.?

329
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,851
No. That's what I am trying to say!

330
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,889
He is still a child!
He's a normal child!

331
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,854
He's made mistakes
and he's got a shitload to learn.

332
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,775
That doesn't mean I'll let
you send him to a school...

333
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,199
that scares him
into following orders!

334
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:18,286
- He thinks the world owes him a living!
- What could have given him that idea?

335
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,370
We tried it your way for 15 years.
Validating his feelings.

336
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:29,542
That school did the same! He thinks
the world runs on his feelings!

337
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,223
- He's gonna go learn to be a man!
- I will not send him to that place!

338
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,551
Oh, no, fuck that! Allow me!

339
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,734
Fuck!

340
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,074
God!

341
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,655
T!

342
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,078
About the sit-down...

343
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,294
Jesus Christ, can I bury
my best friend's kid?

344
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,302
I am not ready for this.

345
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,931
Okay, let's go. We gotta do this.

346
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,763
Come here, you.

347
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,441
Rosalie?

348
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,982
Ro, honey? Hi, sweetheart.

349
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,578
Ro, I'm so sorry.

350
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,327
Lay some off.

351
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,006
I'm so sorry about your brother.

352
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,507
You remember my cousin,
Mackenzie Trucillo?

353
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,975
Oh, my God.

354
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,351
- Sweetheart, let's sit down.
- Come on, sit.

355
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,895
- It's all right.
- Sit down.

356
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,696
It's okay.

357
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,073
A point and a quarter.

358
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,165
Would you listen to me, Moose?
It's very simple.

359
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,668
Look at this place.

360
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:40,256
Two days before the Super Bowl
and nobody shows up.

361
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,674
That's not true.

362
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,845
You'd think I'd remember,
all my years married to Jack.

363
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,435
What happened, Ton?
Vegas moving the line?

364
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,733
Just make sure.

365
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,778
Point and a half.

366
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,163
Talk to you a minute?

367
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:18,803
Russ? Mr. Cozzarelli?
My partner and I cut this.

368
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,557
Devotional music. It's ragged,
it's a demo. Christian contemporary.

369
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,095
I wish I had it for my mom's funeral.
Tommy Mottola at Sony...

370
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,390
looks like he's gonna
offer us a deal.

371
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:44,612
Listen, about Jackie.
And, you know, Ralph.

372
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:48,703
How you handled it,
so it wouldn't stick to any of us...

373
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:57,250
I'm only here out of respect to you.
But I'm sorry.

374
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:02,513
And I appreciate you looking out for me.

375
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,465
- Oh, yeah?
- You two were close, I know...

376
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,600
No, you don't know.

377
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,726
Anyway, what I said,
about not loving you...

378
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,144
<i>That's not how it is.</i>

379
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,146
Let's try it your way.

380
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,484
I got here first? Cocksucker!

381
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,158
Sit down. Relax, have a coffee.
He'll be here.

382
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,167
Well, I think I got Ma situated.

383
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,331
- The Brother Jobe Home?
- No, fuck that. We went there.

384
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,671
Che puzzo, I almost gagged.

385
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,086
We're gonna go with Green Grove.

386
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,343
- On Tony's recommendation.
- I never did that.

387
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,346
You did.
When you had your ma there.

388
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,854
By the way, did she have
the Silver Bird package?

389
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,559
I don't know.

390
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,444
- It's the most expensive nursing home.
- It's a retirement community.

391
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,526
The level of care. Ma was crying.

392
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,861
- Eight grand a month?
- Who cares?

393
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,536
You see a Seeing Eye dog here?
Cup full of pencils?

394
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,742
I'm not trying to insult you...

395
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,408
Be tough, but I'll figure it out.

396
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:59,122
Worth every fucking penny.
I'm the hero now, boy.

397
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,206
Thank you.

398
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,721
- You're late.
- I can be on time...

399
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,052
but you'll always be stupid.

400
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,717
Hey, hey! Sit down!

401
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,728
Sit the fuck down and shut up!

402
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,397
- You want one of those?
- No.

403
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,145
<i>I was at</i> my <i>goomar's</i> all <i>night.</i>

404
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:29,076
Ro, with the grief, poor kid.
I can't get any sleep. It's incessant.

405
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,828
So. Who wants to talk first?

406
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,957
What's to talk about?
I'm owed that 50 G's.

407
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:39,962
A fucking alarm code? 50 G's?
Five, tops. Maybe, as a finder's fee.

408
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,963
The heist fell in your lap.

409
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:45,968
You fuck those fat pigs
at the carpenter's union.

410
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:50,927
Three mil a year from construction,
this family sees.

411
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,184
All right, five's
a negotiating platform.

412
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,136
Take it easy.

413
00:34:56,303 --> 00:35:00,649
It's not five, we all know that.
His guys did the heavy lifting.

414
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,653
Little Paulie was good to go.
Fucking car never came.

415
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,941
They left him waiting outside
his house like an asshole.

416
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,450
Ralphie, give him 12 K.

417
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,296
- I can't believe this.
- Why not?

418
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,835
- You believed a UFO was over Jersey.
- I won't tell you again!

419
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,470
T, I'm asking you to reconsider.

420
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,304
You requested a sit-down.
He heard you out.

421
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,845
But Christ, I'm leaving
$38,000 on the table.

422
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,145
Tony! I had to park the car
all the way over there.

423
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,696
Son of a bitch!

424
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,169
Miss? Where could I find
something more dressy?

425
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,207
- Not evening, but muted?
<i>- I'll</i> go look.

426
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,845
They have this great black
cocktail I saw over there.

427
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,598
Those I have.
Thing is, it's for a funeral.

428
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,516
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. Guy was, like, 22.

429
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,181
Car accident?

430
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,521
Actually, murder.
It was a cousin of mine.

431
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:30,030
Last time I went to one, my boyfriend
bitched over what I wore.

432
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:35,445
It was his boss' mother's wake.
I said, "You think Tony even noticed?"

433
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,363
But he keeps on about everything.

434
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,036
Oh, Madonna. Jesus...

435
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,206
Me, too. I love Blahniks,
but they were killing me last night.

436
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,962
I was gonna go to Starbucks.

437
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,127
- So was I!
- Wanna go together?

438
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,261
- Yeah.
- Great.

439
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,142
- Blahniks are slim-line.
- I was dancing, my God!

440
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,223
<i>- I'll</i> tell you, Jimmy Choos...
- Worse.

441
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,016
- My name's Danielle.
- Adriana. Do you live in Nutley?

442
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,440
<i>If you're one of many
who suffer from erectile dysfunction...</i>

443
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,105
<i>you know it's no laughing matter.</i>

444
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,899
Hey, I know this guy!

445
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,945
<i>- -Treatment is covered
by most medical plans.</i>

446
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,953
<i>I'm Dr. Ira Freid,
of the Freid Medical Group.</i>

447
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,584
<i>Be it Viagra, penile enhancement...</i>

448
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,334
Imagine?
Needing an operation like that?

449
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:34,670
<i>I can increase the length, girth and
vitality of what occurred naturally.</i>

450
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,470
<i>My associates and I have offices
throughout the Tri-State area.</i>

451
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,143
<i>Our discretion is assured.</i>

452
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,139
Ohhh.

453
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,601
- Sergeant Bilko!
- Tony.

454
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,860
You're right. I'm sorry.
But we shouldn't get too gloomy.

455
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,656
My God, your dress grays.
You know what? You look very handsome.

456
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,158
- She's right, you do.
- Yeah, right.

457
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:02,118
No, I'm serious. Tight suit like that,
it shows off your lats.

458
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,658
- Put on the hat.
- No way.

459
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,044
Please? He looked cute
at the uniform company.

460
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,796
You won't sew the hat.

461
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,048
- Just put the hat on.
- No.

462
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,834
What did you say?

463
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,090
Now, look at that.

464
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,093
I'm serious, you're impressive.

465
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,638
If I wasn't already married...

466
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,563
I look like a total jerk-off.

467
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,356
You do not.

468
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,319
What, are you crying?

469
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,577
- I don't wanna go.
- You need toughening!

470
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,116
Tony!

471
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,082
- Stand up straight.
- I'm standing fucking straight!

472
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,751
Hey. you keep it up, goddamn it!

473
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,185
I think...

474
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,858
Think the hat goes on the crook
of your arm here. Like that.

475
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,859
You look good.

476
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,030
Oh, my God!

477
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,914
- Anthony!
- A.J.! A.J.!

478
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,371
Get some water or something.

479
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,419
My son...

480
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,381
has panic attacks.

481
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,046
Obviously, we can't send him
to military school.

482
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,381
Pediatrician said.

483
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,396
He's got that putrid
fucking Soprano gene!

484
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,559
It's a slight tic
in his fight/flight response.

485
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,906
It doesn't brand him as anything.

486
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,574
You know, it comes down
through the ages.

487
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:10,584
My great-great-great-grandfather
drove a mule cart off a road.

488
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,794
He was taking valuable jugs
of olive oil.

489
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,706
Probably was a panic attack.

490
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,095
When you blame your genes,
you're blaming yourself.

491
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,928
And that's what we should
be talking about.

492
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,593
Fucking Verbum Dei school.

493
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,227
It happened before,
but they didn't tell us.

494
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,944
Idiot nurse diagnosed it
as dehydration from football practice.

495
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,948
Can you believe
they didn't inform the parents?

496
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,442
I'm not a litigious person.

497
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,364
I prefer to resolve things directly,
but this time I'll sue!

498
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,831
Well, that's your right.

499
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,259
Anthony?

500
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,771
- You don't understand.
- Make me understand.

501
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,655
- We can't send him to that place.
- Yes?

502
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,573
How we gonna save this kid?

503
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,897
Your mother.

504
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,435
- Come on, let's go.
- Silvio Manfred Dante?

505
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,026
- At a funeral?
- Detective Filemon Francis.

506
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:10,286
You're under arrest for violating New
Jersey penal code, promoting gambling.

507
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:14,370
Every fucking Super Bowl,
the D.A. grabs a few headlines.

508
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,878
Go ahead. Last year I made bail
so fast my soup was still warm.

509
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,873
All right, come on. Keep moving.

510
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,237
- Jesus Christ, you told me 11:00.
- I'm sorry.

511
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,747
Sorry, that's all I hear.

512
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,658
Junior, look.

513
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,746
Junior!

514
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,086
Junior, don't leave me!

515
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:14,931
"In certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life through Christ...

516
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,433
we commend to Almighty God
our brother...

517
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,146
Giacomo Michael Aprile, Jr.

518
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,312
We commit his body to the ground..."

519
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,279
No!

520
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:36,198
Why? Why Jackie?
Why my baby? Why?

521
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,289
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

522
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,545
The Lord bless and keep him.

523
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:47,004
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him and be gracious.

524
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,839
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace."

525
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,476
Someone should go down to Artie's.

526
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,357
Stop thinking, Ro.
Let's get you to bed.

527
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:08,864
He opened up the restaurant for us.
All those people...

528
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,178
- Was he dealing while you were dating?
- Mackenzie.

529
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,843
- Shut your mouth.
- I was just asking.

530
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,058
Oh, please. Okay?

531
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,602
My brother's stupid, pathetic dream
was to follow our father's footsteps.

532
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:51,857
I gotta paint a picture? He was killed
by a fat fuck in see-through socks.

533
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,902
Take your pick, they all look alike.

534
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,366
Actually, Kelli, you really
have no basis to say that.

535
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:06,879
We used to joke around about
our families. What happened to you?

536
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,543
I know this is a really painful
time for you, but...

537
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,384
your brother's best friend
was an Israeli X dealer.

538
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,096
- I met him.
- Wow! So it was international.

539
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,102
Let's just drop it, okay?

540
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,980
Yeah, right.

541
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,895
If my dad still controlled crime
in North Jersey like your dad does...

542
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,940
I'd want to drop it too.
But then...

543
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,233
it might not have happened.

544
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,073
Wait, this is way beyond.

545
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,160
Our dads are in the garbage business.

546
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,417
And they do brush up against
organized crime.

547
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,957
But you think they control
every slimeball and illegal gun?

548
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:56,259
The fact that you would say this in
front of an outsider is amazing to me.

549
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,343
Jesus Christ, some loyalty?

550
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,098
<i>Their names etched in history.</i>

551
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:08,438
<i>Their hands around football's most
revered trophy. immortalized...</i>.

552
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,608
- How are you?
- Good.

553
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:18,443
- Want a drink?
- I gotta go. Ma's alone.

554
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,676
He's serving a full dinner, huh?

555
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,839
I'm done already.
It's good gravy today.

556
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,846
Sad day.

557
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,260
Huhh.

558
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,392
Kid was always a dumb fuck,
wasn't he?

559
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,850
Didn't he almost drown
in 3 inches of water?

560
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,486
The penguin exhibit.

561
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,659
Jack tried to lay Jackie's problems
on a learning disorder, but...

562
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,662
Stupidity would be
a learning disorder.

563
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,165
Look at this crappy turnout.

564
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:12,047
If Jackie Sr. was boss, with a child
dead, this place would be filled.

565
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:18,211
Flower cars up and down the block. No
matter what the boy had done. Now...

566
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:32,609
Bobby says you're out from under
the house arrest. Congratulations.

567
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,362
My lawyer was able to show
I'm not a flight risk.

568
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,027
Flight risk. I been farting into
the same sofa cushion for 18 months.

569
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,867
- RICO trial's coming.
- Least you're out.

570
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,031
And eating regular food.

571
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:52,705
The illness changed my viewpoint.
I'm gonna stop and smell the roses.

572
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,713
We all should.

573
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,879
I mean, what the fuck?

574
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,720
In <i>the</i> museum <i>of noses,
there</i> goes <i>the Mona Lisa.</i>

575
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,602
- Why are you out here?
- Ginny thinks I quit.

576
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,895
Jesus Christ. Fucking underboss
of a Five Families family.

577
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,614
Ginny can get heavy.

578
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,823
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

579
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,911
You can tell Uncle John.

580
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:36,582
Tony knows my mother's ill, then rules
against me in this Morristown shit.

581
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,967
- Maybe you heard.
- I don't stick my beak in.

582
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,505
Since Ralphie's bringing him
Esplanade scarole...

583
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,591
Tony acts like I have a load
in my pants.

584
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,599
- No.
- I'm not insensitive. I hurt too.

585
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,316
- You think Tony plays favorites?
- What do I say to Ma?

586
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,318
She thinks she's going
to this paradise.

587
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,822
Same one his mother
stayed at for a year.

588
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,994
Don't confuse money with care.
Look how he treated her.

589
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,450
He's my dear friend, but come on.

590
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:13,493
I just said that to Junior. That maybe
Tony don't respect the elderly.

591
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,162
You said that to Junior?

592
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,957
What are you making, minestrone?

593
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,299
You know, Carmine sometimes
gets frustrated with Tony.

594
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,715
And Ralphie. That generation.

595
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:31,136
He thinks the Esplanade thing
wasn't handled right, risk-wise.

596
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,805
How is Carmine?

597
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,025
- He asks about you.
- Send my love.

598
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,312
I will. They like hearing that.

599
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,407
He's not well either, you know.

600
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:50,200
If there's ever anything I can do,
anything, he shouldn't hesitate.

601
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,908
I'll tell him.

602
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,379
You Okay?

603
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,840
Yeah.

604
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,181
You had a few drinks over there.

605
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,343
We all could use it.

606
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,598
I was thinking before.

607
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,852
About what you once said.

608
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,364
How you have to max out the good
times with the people you love.

609
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,448
God, am I learning that
that is so true.

610
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,238
Actually, your father said that.

611
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,212
Anyway, when you see how people
deal with each other...

612
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,466
- Even families. Like Jackie's family.
- What about them?

613
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,385
Were never there for him.

614
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,889
I mean, Aunt Ra's sweet,
but she's, like, hello.

615
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,720
Uncle Jackie?

616
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,059
So narcissistic.

617
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,767
They let him do whatever he wanted.

618
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:01,105
You'd ask, "Aren't you afraid
what your parents will say?"

619
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,769
About whatever...

620
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:06,565
And he would just go,
"They don't give a shit."

621
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,619
But I think it hurt
his feelings inside.

622
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,993
Well, I'm glad you see.

623
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,622
Yeah, right. You're glad I see.

624
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,913
You take this as an excuse
to get controlling.

625
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,628
That is not what I'm talking about!

626
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,758
What did I say?

627
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:33,299
- You're out from under our roof.
- Then you'll use it against A.J.

628
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,680
Against him?

629
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,763
I'm sorry I said anything!

630
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:47,772
Bearded stranger turns, rabbi goes,
"Don't touch me, I'm on disability!"

631
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,034
They're back!

632
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,334
Great fucking timing.

633
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,655
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

634
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,053
Come on, Junior, sing it!

635
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,512
- Junior!
- Come on! Come on!

636
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,972
Come on, let's go!

637
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,061
What the hell?

638
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,114
That's right!

639
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,905
I beat cancer.

640
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,241
Now I'm gonna beat the can.

641
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,462
That's too high. Bring it down.

642
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,418
What is this?

643
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,629
- What's that?
- Cosmo.

644
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,716
He's not bad when
he's had a few 'bucas.

645
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,131
- He's shitfaced.
- And don't laugh.

646
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,492
<i>Opps, I did it again.</i>

647
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,200
Hold this.

648
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:28,660
Yeah, yeah. I'm going, I'm going.

649
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,669
Come here!

650
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,886
Did you hear me?
I said come here!

651
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,508
This is such bullshit!

652
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,809
Meadow!

653
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,521
Hey, guys. Let's go.

654
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,190
Come on.

655
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,418
- Back to school, I guess.
- Did you give her money for the bus?

656
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:15,798
I don't know. She got her purse.
She'll be all right.

657
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,311
Stand still. And be quiet.

658
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,431
What's that mean? Cuore ingrato?

659
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,343
Ungrateful heart.
