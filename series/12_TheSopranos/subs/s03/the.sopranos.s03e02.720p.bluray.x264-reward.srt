3
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,076
You got the crescent wrench?

4
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,786
Nobody puts it back...

5
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,331
Oh, my God!

6
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,459
Tony! Tony!

7
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,957
Oh, my God,
Tony, are you all right?

8
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,218
- Uncle Ben.
- What happened?

9
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,123
What are you doing here?

10
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,837
We had to drive back. Someone stole
the VCR from the common room.

11
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,428
<i>Public Enemy! That's</i> a great <i>movie.</i>

12
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,768
For our class. Just finished.

13
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,553
We're out of here.

14
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,389
$40,000 a year to watch movies?
Who's "we"?

15
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,560
Just a friend from class, okay?

16
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,241
- Your mom likes lavender.
<i>- I'll</i> be ready.

17
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,785
Mr. Soprano?

18
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,912
- I'm Noah Tannenbaum.
- How you doing?

19
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,750
Thanks for letting us screen.
The speakers are great.

20
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,577
You a film buff?

21
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:08,924
Some say Hawks made the genre with
Scarf ace, but Cagney was modernity.

22
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,211
Muni was not,
so I give the nod to Wellman.

23
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,799
I'm just gonna grab that CD,
then let's hit the road.

24
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,476
The last year for this course.

25
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:30,275
"Hypercapitalist Self-Advancement
in the Era of the Studio System."

26
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,609
So you guys, you and Meadow,
are you...?

27
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,777
A little early to say.

28
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
- What's your background, Noel?
- Noah.

29
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,621
I'm from Los Angeles. West L.A.

30
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,951
No, I mean...

31
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,706
My family's in the business.
Show business.

32
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,461
- Those old Tarzan movies?
- My dad's an entertainment lawyer.

33
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,429
What I mean is, like, we're Italian.

34
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,009
My dad's Jewish,
my mom's African-American.

35
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,014
Tannenbaum, right.

36
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,355
But on your application,
you checked Jewish?

37
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:10,228
- No. They can't ask about religion.
- Right, of course.

38
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,980
- What'd you check?
- African-American.

39
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,524
So we get it. You're a ditsoon.

40
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,984
Excuse me?

41
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,781
Charcoal briquette? A melanzane?

42
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,457
- What's your problem?
- You know.

43
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,538
She didn't do you any favors
bringing you here.

44
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,506
I don't know what she was thinking.

45
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,168
I got associates who are black.

46
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,133
I don't want their sons
with my daughter.

47
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,509
Fuck you.

48
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,141
See, that's what I want to avoid.

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:46,017
So when my girl comes down,
you say it was nice to meet me.

50
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,150
Then you'll take her to school
and say goodbye.

51
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,519
Let's see the Garden State.

52
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,149
We're gonna drop by Hunter's.
I want her to meet Noah.

53
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,577
Later, Dad.

54
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:43,362
- I don't got time for these attacks.
- It's been good for months.

55
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,572
- If you didn't instigate...
- Me?

56
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,209
- He's just a friend.
- You didn't see them.

57
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,832
You want her with him, keep it up.

58
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,252
Play the race card,
she'll run into his arms.

59
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,926
- Not if I cut off those arms.
- Stop it.

60
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,848
Let me deal with it,
if anybody's going to.

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,765
Make things worse with your shit,
I'm gonna be pissed.

62
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,938
I should call Cusamano.
You might need stitches.

63
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,576
If my sisters ever brought home
a butterhead, my old man...

64
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,251
Hey, Ma.

65
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,120
Look who calls.

66
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,130
Actually, I'm standing
in front of you.

67
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,966
Hey.

68
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,294
So how's it going?

69
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,631
What do you care?
Out of sight, out of mind.

70
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:50,601
I brought you some books on tape,
since you can't concentrate to read.

71
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,899
I wish the Lord would take me now.

72
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,479
In the meantime, I brought
The Horse Whisperer and Omerta.

73
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,272
Why, what's wrong?

74
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,781
You gonna freak out every time
I do something nice?

75
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,154
What's this?

76
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,825
She's finishing baby journals
from long ago.

77
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,959
My idea.

78
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,671
Oh, yeah, I remember these.

79
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,132
Carmela gave you one
for each of the kids.

80
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,758
What the fuck?

81
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,214
You're supposed to fill these out.
Twenty years, nothing!

82
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,718
Now look here,
I don't like that kind of talk.

83
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,728
Stop it, it upsets me.

84
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,812
Carmela's ma returned these
to the kids filled with memories.

85
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,692
- You can't write stuff for my kids?
- That's nobody's business.

86
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,532
- Too busy feeling sorry for yourself.
- She'll do it.

87
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:49,037
It's good for her. She knows that.
Keep her mind active.

88
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,366
Why do anything if there's
nothing in it for her?

89
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,702
Listen up.

90
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,580
Concentrate. I know it's difficult.

91
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,084
- Remember the plane tickets?
- They were stolen.

92
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,051
Did you say that, or did the feds?
What did you tell them?

93
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,556
What did I do?

94
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,390
They're trying to build
a RICO case against me.

95
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,556
What will you say
on the witness stand?

96
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,568
They only let you go
to get your cooperation.

97
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,694
Don't wave your hanky at me.
What will you say from now on?

98
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,902
I never stated those tickets
were stolen.

99
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,612
Barb'll testify. You back her up.

100
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,287
I should have kept my mouth shut,
like a mute.

101
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,748
In the future, any deal they make...

102
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,372
you keep your mouth shut.

103
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:49,382
For a year I didn't speak to you.
Maybe I should have kept it that way.

104
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,435
Fuck it. Do what you want.

105
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,183
Did you say something to Noah?

106
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,317
If you're smart, keep walking.

107
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,608
You did. What did you say?

108
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,692
He was quiet at Hunter's.
Now he's sitting in the car.

109
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,161
You didn't hear?
Maybe if I say it in Swahili!

110
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,576
Meadow, can
you come up here?

111
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,368
What?!

112
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,994
I need your help with this clasp.

113
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,331
<i>That ain't our beer.</i>

114
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,171
<i>It's good, and cheaper than yours.</i>

115
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,465
Ls my laundry done?

116
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,682
<i>I can't help it if I have to buy
from Schemer Burns.</i>

117
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,343
<i>You're yellow!</i>

118
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,021
<i>You ain't gonna slug me, are you?</i>

119
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,169
What?

120
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,716
Your mother died.

121
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,847
You're kidding.

122
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,384
I mean...

123
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,273
- Jesus Christ.
- Svetlana just called.

124
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,732
She said that after dinner
your mother went upstairs.

125
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,070
When Svetlana came up,
your mother was under the covers.

126
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,241
Svetlana thought she was asleep.

127
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,217
- Svetlana's waiting for us.
- She's dead?

128
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,228
I'm sorry, Dad.

129
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,933
- That your mom died.
- Me too.

130
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,436
Your grandmother loved you.

131
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,948
She loved both you two. Very much.

132
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,487
- They just remove.
- We saw.

133
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,236
She was in no pain, Tony.

134
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,744
- What about the cause of death?
- Massive stroke.

135
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,453
Yeah.

136
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,337
She will not be finishing journal.
I break promise.

137
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,841
Is not often that these old
ones get away with something.

138
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,510
A journal?

139
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,804
Nothing.

140
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,603
<i>Those Granny Remembers</i> books you
<i>bought her when the kids were</i> born.

141
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,476
She never touched them.

142
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,854
What's your beef?

143
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,567
Asshole Robert Frost.

144
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,531
How am I supposed to know
what this means? Like I even care.

145
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,039
"Stopping by Woods
on a Snowy Evening."

146
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,912
I'm glad I'm not in
high school anymore.

147
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,789
- You read this?
- Sure.

148
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,797
What does it mean? It's due tomorrow.

149
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,423
What does it mean?

150
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,843
<i>The woods are lovely, dark and deep
But I have promises to keep</i>

151
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,426
<i>And miles to go before I sleep</i>

152
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,894
Okay, look. Where is he?

153
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,225
- In a field, on a horse.
- Not on a horse. It has bells.

154
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,901
- So?
- What kind of horse has bells?

155
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,231
I don't know.
Give me the fucking answer.

156
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,942
A horse that's pulling a sleigh.

157
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:07,040
It's a Thanksgiving poem? Like "Over
the River and Through the Woods"?

158
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,086
It's not Thanksgiving.
What's covering the field?

159
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,922
- Snow?
- And what does snow symbolize?

160
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,253
Christmas?

161
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,884
Hello?

162
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,928
Cold? Endless white?

163
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,427
- Endless nothing?
- I don't know!

164
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,637
- Death!
- I thought black was death.

165
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,979
- Miles to go before he sleeps.
- He's far from his house.

166
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,601
The sleep of death.
He's talking about his own death...

167
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,980
which has yet to come,
but will come.

168
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,614
That's fucked up.

169
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,072
Gotta go.

170
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,913
- I thought black was death.
- White too.

171
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm coming, I'm coming.

172
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,985
Grandma?

173
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,488
<i>- I can't believe it.
- What're you</i> gonna <i>do?</i>

174
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,997
<i>- I'll</i> call Janice.
- Meet you at Cozzerelli's around noon.

175
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:35,959
<i>- I already called.
- Ma didn't want any kind of</i> service.

176
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,505
So we'll pick out a simple urn
or whatever.

177
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,631
I'll see you there.

178
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,449
<i>Proshai, Livushka.</i>

179
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,568
Which means what?

180
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,534
Goodbye, little Livia.

181
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,210
<i>He's been in this situation
a million times.</i>

182
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>We'll see what happens.
There he is, pulling that in.</i>

183
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,679
<i>He's got the eye of the tiger.</i>

184
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,881
- Ton.
- Anthony, turn it off.

185
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,096
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,097
We all know how much you loved her.

187
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,690
Thanks.

188
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,362
- I can imagine how you feel.
- Yeah, well...

189
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,909
What're you gonna do?

190
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,375
I'm sorry, T.

191
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,759
What're you gonna do?

192
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,233
- At least she didn't suffer.
- That's right.

193
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,735
My God!

194
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,651
What next, huh?

195
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
How's Tony taking it?

196
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,126
What the fuck?!
Goddamn fucking bitch!

197
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:44,959
She was awful. How do I tell my kids
their aunt won't come to a funeral?

198
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,592
I'll handle it.

199
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,935
Then he goes,
"You gotta work on Columbus Day."

200
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,063
Eat your eggs, baby.

201
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,480
Ace Garage.

202
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,863
<i>You're not coming to your mother's
fucking funeral?</i>

203
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,362
- May I <i>speak?
- Our sister's sobbing!</i>

204
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,493
May I Speak?

205
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,616
<i>Go the fuck ahead!</i>

206
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,827
You may recall that I have
good and valid reasons...

207
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,670
not to enter the state
of New Jersey.

208
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,339
<i>That case is colder than your tit.</i>

209
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,342
It'd be good to show up.
Nothing to hide.

210
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,470
- I don't do well at funerals.
- Who does?

211
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,307
- You don't wanna leave your chair.
<i>- I'll</i> hang up!

212
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,979
She didn't want a funeral,
but can't you sit with your family?

213
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,229
- She was your mother!
- For us working folk...

214
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,193
Woody Guthrie over here.

215
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,824
<i>- They got special rates for deaths.
- Yeah,</i> half of <i>full fare...</i>

216
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,325
which, at this late date,
comes to $1100.

217
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,749
Fully researched.
Fuck it, I'll pay it.

218
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,037
- Can I bring my fiancé?
- Fuck that! One seat, coach!

219
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,546
And don't breeze in
when it's time to divide the estate!

220
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,803
<i>I know you think Ma's got money
buried in the house!</i>

221
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,260
- What about that other thing?
<i>- Richie?</i>

222
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,764
He went into witness protection.
It's the truth. Right?

223
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>Cozzerelli's Funeral Home.
Noon, tomorrow.</i>

224
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,568
Does Harpo know his grandmother died?
Him, I'll pay for.

225
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,944
Bring him down. He's your son.

226
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,738
Hal is on the pavers, Tony.
He's a street person.

227
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,791
- I didn't know.
- You're not the only one with problems.

228
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,534
Be there tomorrow.

229
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,808
<i>- Got</i> a <i>drink in the house?
- I wish...</i>

230
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,648
<i>There you go with
that wishing stuff again!</i>

231
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:13,695
<i>I wish you was a wishing well.
I'd tie a bucket to you and sink you.</i>

232
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,488
<i>Maybe you found someone
you like better.</i>

233
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,287
<i>Oh, Tommy!
Let me make you a cup of tea.</i>

234
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,830
<i>I came over to give you something.
Here, take this.</i>

235
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,123
<i>If you need more, just say so.</i>

236
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,131
<i>- I'm caring for Ma.
- On two bits a week?</i>

237
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,261
<i>Ma don't go to nightclubs.</i>

238
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,215
<i>How do you know? I used to dance.</i>

239
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,801
<i>- Money's nothing to me.
- I guess not.</i>

240
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,097
<i>But with no heart and no brains,
it's all you've got.</i>

241
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,896
<i>Tommy! Tommy!</i>

242
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,998
His mother died last night.

243
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,041
No shit?

244
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,318
Ton, I'm so sorry to hear.

245
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,075
What're you gonna do?

246
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,873
I know how you feel.

247
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,330
We lost Mom last year.

248
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,666
You remember.

249
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,397
- Least she didn't suffer.
- Ralphie, I need to talk to you.

250
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,445
Albert, you too.

251
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,572
<i>Vito, have</i> a <i>sfogliatella.</i>

252
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,859
Carmela, she's gone.

253
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,988
Come on.

254
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,551
- Who torched one of Albert's trucks?
- One of the trucks?

255
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,843
Be quiet.

256
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,046
He lit up two of my dumpsters.

257
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,970
What's the matter with you?
We're in the newspapers every week.

258
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,936
My crew is in line for
the Raritan Township contract.

259
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,476
They keep whispering to Albert!

260
00:23:55,768 --> 00:24:00,945
- What did you say? Whose crew?
- You put anyone you want over the crew.

261
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,949
- You're a captain when I say you are.
<i>- I'll</i> turn up my hearing aid.

262
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,115
Getting cute with me?
With my mother dead?

263
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,912
Raritan Township recycling manager,
Joe Zachary.

264
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,625
I'm in line for the contract,
but he's talking to Albert.

265
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,754
- He's threatening to go to the EPA.
- He said that?

266
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,642
All right, fix it.

267
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,434
No more fires.

268
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,455
<i>I'm ditching Spanish.
Meet me by the trophy case.</i>

269
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,629
How could we possibly get busted?

270
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,424
The boys' room by the stage?
They never check it.

271
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:16,558
Mr. Soprano, Janice, Barb.
Please accept my condolences.

272
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,527
I'll use all my skills.

273
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,485
Don't go crazy. I mean, you know?

274
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,865
Then we're not envisioning
any visitation hours for Mom?

275
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:33,204
- She didn't want any service.
- I find that hard to accept.

276
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,706
Is she still down
at the hospital morgue?

277
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:44,051
We brought Mom here this morning.
She's downstairs.

278
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:53,557
- There's gonna be a priest, right?
- Yeah, sure. A priest, I guess.

279
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,728
When would that be?

280
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,350
You're not having a Mass?
I'm not selling here.

281
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,232
She was Catholic but not religious.

282
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,233
I thought we'd have a shindig
at the house.

283
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:11,700
After. So the grand kids could,
you know...

284
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,906
I don't know.

285
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,580
I know what Mom's wishes were,
but not to have a wake?

286
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,713
We look like unloving children,
and cheapskates.

287
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,420
Who gives a shit? It's her wishes.

288
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,304
I wish to honor her.

289
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,517
There's a lot of things I could say
that I won't!

290
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,017
You think we should do something now?

291
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,648
She used to picture her funeral.

292
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,114
You wanna do something,
let's just do it.

293
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,742
Cozzerelli, arrange it all.
Send me the bill.

294
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,947
Tony, this all won't fall on you.

295
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,533
I'll paint the overleaf
for the program.

296
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,079
Motifs from the
Mexican Day of the Dead.

297
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,665
One thing that I'd like to suggest:

298
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:10,342
Everyone gathers and can voice
a remembrance or a feeling about Mom.

299
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,849
I don't want any California bullshit.

300
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,352
People can drink, they can eat.

301
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,312
If they wanna yak about Ma, they can.

302
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,325
No "I'm sorry, my condolences." Nothing.

303
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,624
Actually, that's good.

304
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:49,002
It's a relief, you not saying nothing,
to tell the truth.

305
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,134
You know, everybody else,
all bullshit.

306
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,483
All right, here's the thing.
I'm glad she's dead.

307
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:09,359
Not just glad. I wished she'd die. Wished.

308
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:16,158
Had this court case coming up.
She might've testified against me.

309
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:21,538
So when I heard she was dead,
relief flooded into my veins.

310
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,713
How do you feel about your mother
testifying against you?

311
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,879
Come on, will you listen to yourself?

312
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,676
Is that right, wishing her dead?

313
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,937
- Is that being a good son?
- Good son?

314
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,650
- Yeah, a good son. I mean, bad sons...
- Bad sons what?

315
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,020
They should fucking die.

316
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,903
That's a fucking
disgusting thing to be.

317
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,911
Your kid, at Bard.
He better be a good son, right?

318
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,676
You're right. Why should
I be good to that old bat?

319
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,176
That fucking selfish, miserable cunt?

320
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,934
She ruined my father's life.
Oh, yeah.

321
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:25,940
But he wasn't her son.
What did she do to you?

322
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,606
That's a matter of public record.
We both know.

323
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,781
- You can't say it.
- She didn't know what she was doing.

324
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,702
- You're letting her off.
- My uncle denies it.

325
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,324
- He loves you.
- I know that!

326
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,791
Grown children often wish
for an aged parent to die.

327
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,126
It's not necessary for the parent
to testify against them.

328
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,420
It's a taboo thought, but common.

329
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:59,428
Particularly if the parent has lost
all capacity for joy at being alive.

330
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,643
So we're probably done here, right?

331
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,652
She's dead.

332
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,988
- What is it?
- Tony's mother's wake is tonight.

333
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,124
Want me to wear a wire?

334
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,830
Sure. Need batteries?
Let's go to Office Depot.

335
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,013
Janice?

336
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,512
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

337
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,892
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,314
- Mom would want a closed casket.
- Definitely.

339
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:01,072
They usually put a picture on the casket.
What do you think?

340
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,537
- Look at that.
- She's smiling.

341
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,033
She looks normal.

342
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,786
- It was us kids who turned her.
- One of us.

343
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,210
Get the fuck off!

344
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,717
All right, all right!

345
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,218
Maybe you're right.

346
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,560
My shrink says all women
aren't cut out to be mothers.

347
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,104
- Is that a slam at me?
- No.

348
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,816
If my father was in the circus,
maybe I'd turn out like Harp...

349
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,237
Hal.

350
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,243
- This is weird.
- What?

351
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,198
None of my childhood artwork
is here anymore.

352
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,249
Nor Barb's.

353
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,586
Get the fuck out of here.

354
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,630
"Anthony Soprano, 7th grade,
Mr. Martino." I had him.

355
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:03,343
"Why Fear Strikes Out by Jim Piersall
is a good book."

356
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,387
Take a look. She only saved yours.

357
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,936
What? Here's Barbara's
Communion certificate.

358
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,732
- Here's her baby shoe.
- Yeah. That's it.

359
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,560
Nothing of mine.

360
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:28,448
Everybody agreed I had
"extraordinary visualization skills."

361
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,581
Those pencil drawings
that I did of Grandpa?

362
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,371
Good.

363
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,639
Tony. Sorry.

364
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,266
Tony, I'm sorry.

365
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,643
He's disrespectful.

366
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,145
Thanks for coming.

367
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,988
Fucking motherfucking
pain in the fucking <i>ass!</i>

368
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,196
Could we not, huh?
With the tantrums?

369
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,785
For this I miss the Jets game?

370
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:19,165
Did they say when your making ceremony
might happen, with this delay?

371
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,757
Stop asking fucking questions.
If I knew, I couldn't tell you.

372
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,840
Hit me. Hit me.

373
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,441
Every little bit helps.
Anything to get through these events.

374
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,893
Hey.

375
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,775
- What a fucking blow.
- You too?

376
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,518
I'm serious.

377
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,530
Breaking the terms
of your house arrest?

378
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,987
I got a dispensation.

379
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,070
She's my sister-in-law, for chrissake.

380
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,078
My dad's very ill too.

381
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,713
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

382
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,834
Tony'

383
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,586
Allow me to express my condolences.

384
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,423
Thanks, assemblyman.

385
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:54,390
I met your mom once or twice.
That was a proud Newarker.

386
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,059
Oh, hey. Reverend.

387
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,234
My sympathies, Tony.
We talked about this day, did we not?

388
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:08,608
You know State Assemblyman
Zellman, right? 8th Ward?

389
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,775
Do I know him? You bet.

390
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,320
Yes, we go way back.
How are you?

391
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,829
Reverend.

392
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,168
Uncle Jun? You all right?

393
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,383
They're dropping like fucking flies.

394
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:32,264
- It's that charcoal-broiled meat.
- Nobody told us!

395
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,638
I'm kidding, you fuck.
What's the matter?

396
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,813
- You wanted to talk?
- I gotta talk to your wife.

397
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,352
Jun, come on.

398
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,110
This is a funeral.
Enough of her soigné attitude.

399
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,083
- What do you want?
- To use this sad occasion...

400
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,415
to put bitterness and
sore-headed feelings aside.

401
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,542
I'll behave how Tony wants.
I don't want to add to his stress.

402
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,087
- There they are.
- Hi, Uncle Jun.

403
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,715
How's that surfboard I gave you?

404
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,177
Tony's waiting.

405
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,908
Ralphie Cifaretto got word to me.

406
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,169
- What does he want?
- A bump up to captain.

407
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,125
The kid's been a top earner since
that rat bastard went in the program.

408
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,177
He whipped his crew into shape.

409
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,302
Three months ago, the rat bastard
was the second coming.

410
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,050
I'm boss. You forget.

411
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,511
I forget nothing.

412
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,441
- Don't make me say things we'd regret.
- Go ahead, I'm fed up.

413
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,767
Hey.

414
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,530
I'm on the street. That's the arrangement.

415
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,732
Stay home, clip coupons.

416
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,740
Things are good,
but the economy's so robust...

417
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,745
you get credit for everything.
Chinks and housewives bet football.

418
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,750
You better be finished.

419
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,061
- Joe Zachary?
- Yeah.

420
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,569
Oh, boys. No fires.

421
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,572
Tony doesn't want any fires.

422
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,321
<i>I ain't so tough.</i>

423
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,988
<i>- Well, what do you think?
- Can't say.</i>

424
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,740
<i>Hope for the best.</i>

425
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,037
<i>Doctor, this is Tom's mother,
brother, and Miss Doyle.</i>

426
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,387
The Lord bless her and keep her.

427
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,859
The Lord make his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.

428
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,067
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon her and give her peace.

429
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,357
Amen.

430
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,875
- Did you talk to her?
- She's sure you said something.

431
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,665
He won't discuss it. He clams up.

432
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,553
- Beautiful sendoff, T.
- Thank you.

433
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,020
I want to thank you
for all you've done for her.

434
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,697
She was much work.
In end, she defeated me.

435
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,240
We won't need your services anymore.

436
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,248
I'll be moving in.
If you could get your stuff out...

437
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,745
that'd be good.

438
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:14,584
I stay there only during week,
when my fiance has his children.

439
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,343
Tony <i>says</i> I can continue situation
till Bill and me find house.

440
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,922
Tony should have consulted me.
I'll be living at 55 Benedek...

441
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,804
while we deal with the estate.

442
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:32,439
Speaking of which, my mom had
an extensive record collection.

443
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,644
Caruso, Robert Merrill,
a shitload of Broadway shows.

444
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,612
Do you know where they are?

445
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,445
- She gave to me those records.
- What?

446
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:46,404
She know I like American show tunes.
I didn't ask.

447
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,491
They're my mother's records.
I feel very close to them.

448
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,876
I don't want make a trouble,
but I have to respect her wishes.

449
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,591
This is just about you bogarting
those discs for your ass.

450
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,635
They're worth a fortune.

451
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,005
I will not answer such here.

452
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:10,511
I want the entire discography
back at the house by this weekend.

453
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,684
Mrs. S.

454
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,484
How are you?

455
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,817
Sit down. How's your mother?

456
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,283
- You call her every day.
- Mom passed away.

457
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,081
Really? When?

458
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:39,665
- About six months ago.
- Please, give her my regards.

459
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,552
Is she still on that crazy diet?

460
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,639
I brought you something.

461
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:57,020
From my restaurant.
I don't know if you remember, Vesuvio?

462
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,772
Mrs. S?

463
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,688
What's the matter?

464
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,029
After what my son did to you?

465
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,946
- How can I look you in the face?
- What now?

466
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,078
You don't blame him for the fire?

467
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,701
Artie, what are you doing?

468
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,421
Come on, we have people arriving.
Let's go.

469
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:25,010
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

470
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,556
Look at her.

471
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,559
She's becoming a robot, like us.

472
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,060
- I'm so sorry.
- At least she didn't suffer.

473
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,315
All her innocence is gone.

474
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,245
Then the Rabbi has to extol
the virtues of the deceased.

475
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:56,537
The Rabbi says,
"I did not know this man. I'm new.

476
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,085
You knew him. Say something good."

477
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,087
Silence. Goes on for about a minute.

478
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,086
Finally, from the back:

479
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,758
"His brother was worse."

480
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:25,270
I walk out with the provolone,
and he thinks I smell like that!

481
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:36,448
This Survivor. I should find the winner,
pull out a gun and say:

482
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:41,913
"You're not gonna survive unless you give
me 25 percent of that million dollars."

483
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,423
Not bad. We could find out
where they live.

484
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,172
"See how you survive this,
pezzo di merda. <i>"</i>

485
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,389
Everyone, please.
May I have your attention?

486
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,846
We would like to ask you all
to join us in the great room.

487
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,187
Form a circle,
sit anywhere, get comfortable...

488
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,687
so that we can all be together
and share a remembrance...

489
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,656
about the woman
who brought us here.

490
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,318
- Goddamn it.
- Please, join us.

491
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,331
Paulie Gualtieri? Join us, please?

492
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,956
Thank you.

493
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,378
What the fuck did I say?

494
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,930
If you'd rather,
I can invite them to her place.

495
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,593
- Janice, what are you doing?
- Very good.

496
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,055
We can all take a break from eating
for five minutes.

497
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,027
Most of you will probably remember
that this was her favorite song.

498
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,401
It might help us get rolling.

499
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,794
Herman Rabkin?

500
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,054
You two went back.
Almost to the pyramids.

501
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:06,814
I...

502
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,770
I guess what struck me most was...

503
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,564
she didn't mince words.

504
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,538
Between brain and mouth,
there was no interlocutor.

505
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,222
Anthony Jr.

506
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,345
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on.

507
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,596
Lay off, Janice. Move on.

508
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,356
She was my best friend.

509
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:03,163
If anybody died
or was in the hospital...

510
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,830
I'd get a call from Li
letting me know.

511
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,383
Thank you, Fanny. Thank you.

512
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:29,898
Okay. What's good for the goose...

513
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,606
Most of you remember that I have
an extraordinary visual sense.

514
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,494
As a child, Mom didn't let me
rest on those laurels.

515
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,539
She didn't flatter me.

516
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:54,335
She believed that wildﬂowers
blossom best...

517
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,543
among the rocks, with little water.

518
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,965
She was tough.

519
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,845
But she was right.

520
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,346
She's the reason I make videos today.

521
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,193
Tony?

522
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,077
Maybe you'd like
to tell them how Ma...

523
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,826
saved all your childhood schoolwork
and none of mine or Barbara's.

524
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,797
You just did. Wrap it up, Janice.

525
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,093
I hear she didn't suffer.

526
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,304
For that, we can be grateful.

527
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,848
Thank you.

528
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:03,446
They say there's no two people
on Earth exactly the same.

529
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,156
No two faces,
no two sets of fingerprints.

530
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,412
But do they know for sure?

531
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:18,248
Because they would have to get
everybody together in one huge space.

532
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,718
Obviously, that's not possible,
even with computers.

533
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:29,472
They'd have to get everyone who
ever lived, not just the ones now.

534
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,679
So they got no proof.
They got nothing.

535
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,900
Hey.

536
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,538
- So, Ton, she's dead.
- What?

537
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,172
I guess our little secret...

538
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,127
dies with her.

539
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,941
Hey, pick that up!

540
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,191
What am I doing out here?

541
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,651
Everyone's telling stories of her.
I got a beaut!

542
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:28,992
Artie.

543
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,787
Artie! Don't talk about that!

544
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:41,123
She may have passed, but who's to say
there's not another just like her?

545
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:46,336
Maybe not with the same fears
and paranoia, but...

546
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,046
the same.

547
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,101
What I'm saying is...

548
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,359
Thank you, Chris. Thank you.

549
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,656
Umm...

550
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,749
- This is such a crock of shit.
- Carmela!

551
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:25,421
On one hand, I want to protect
my children from the truth.

552
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:30,430
On the other, I'm saying,
"What kind of example am I setting?"

553
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:34,763
Evading and smiling,
passing out cheese puffs.

554
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:38,388
Over a woman who was
terribly dysfunctional.

555
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,600
Who spread no cheer at all.

556
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,518
- Carmela, be quiet.
- This is my house!

557
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,276
- I'm leaving.
- Let her talk!

558
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,066
I'll speak if I want! Who are you?

559
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,777
Minister of Propaganda?

560
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,531
We suffered for years
under the yoke of that woman.

561
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,292
She estranged us
from our own daughter.

562
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,459
Ruined I don't know how many
goddamned Christmases.

563
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,588
No, don't hand me that! Bullshit!

564
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,137
You wanted it, you got it.

565
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,969
Hear, hear.

566
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,437
From beyond the grave even.

567
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,817
This woman didn't want a funeral.

568
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,196
You all, her children,
ignored her wishes.

569
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,066
Only after she's dead, by the way.

570
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,616
She didn't want a funeral.
She didn't want a remembrance.

571
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,824
Why?

572
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,499
She didn't think anybody would come!

573
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,718
She wouldn't write down
her memories...

574
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,930
because nobody loved her
enough to read them.

575
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,893
She knew there was a problem.

576
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,112
There's desserts...

577
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,908
in the dining room,
if anybody wants some.

578
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,869
Yes.

579
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,545
And they're all from Vesuvio.

580
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:35,180
Our new pastry chef, Bobby Vasquez.
Thanks.

581
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:46,228
<i>Tommy? Mike's here.</i>

582
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,901
<i>He's come to see you.</i>

583
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,067
<i>You must like Mike
a lot better than me.</i>

584
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,734
<i>No, Tommy boy. You're my baby.</i>

585
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,699
<i>You're going to get well and strong.</i>

586
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,032
<i>All of us. Together again.</i>

587
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,252
<i>I'm almost glad this happened.</i>

588
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,763
<i>Yeah? This is Mike.</i>

589
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,894
<i>When?</i>

590
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,098
<i>You are? Fine.</i>

591
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,608
<i>- They're bringing Tom home.
- When?</i>

592
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,937
<i>- Right now. He's on his way.
- Wonderful!</i>

593
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,654
<i>I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.</i>
