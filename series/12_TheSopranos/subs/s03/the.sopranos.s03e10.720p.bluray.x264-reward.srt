2
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,986
I'm in Asbury.

3
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,774
I'll be at your
boatyard in 15 minutes.

4
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,740
No, I got a meeting,
I'll come there after.

5
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,696
<i>O.J. Simpson's acquittal
they still cannot accept,</i>

6
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,732
<i>and now they're suing him
in civil court.</i>

7
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,617
<i>Simpson's attorney is outraged,</i>

8
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,528
<i>Fred Goldman is philosophical.</i>

9
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,447
In Jersey, they'd have
fried his worthless ass.

10
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,833
Well, he's shunned
on his golf course now.

11
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,956
Oh!

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,291
There he is,
F. Lee Fatfuck.

13
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,877
Hold my briefs.

14
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,166
What's the matter with you?

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,088
My back, fuckin' ValueJet,
trying to save 50 bucks.

16
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,693
- How was Boca?
- How do you think?

17
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,141
Your uncle's quaking
in his boots I was there to pop him.

18
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,303
Ho, wait till
we get outside, huh?

19
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,470
Junior's looking for a way out.

20
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,355
But, he's got that
iron rod up his ass.

21
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,734
He thought he was
in line to be boss.

22
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,144
Now he's gotta take orders
from somebody

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,687
who used to fetch him
his Sambuca.

24
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,901
Hey, fuck him.

25
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,407
Is he gonna sit down or not?

26
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,863
If Tony will guarantee
his safety.

27
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,529
You deal with it,
alright, Tony?

28
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,412
Make it Christmas,

29
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,576
this way I don't have to
go on that fuckin' cruise.

30
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,461
No sooner do I
get back from Florida

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,749
than Ange has booked a suite
on the Dawn Princess.

32
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,792
5,000 bucks a week
and no way off.

33
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,427
Thank God Carm gets seasick.

34
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,509
We're staying home this year
so Jackie can study for his SATs.

35
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,265
Ro found him a great tutor.

36
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,676
Pray he goes to a state school.

37
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,685
You oughta see Terri's
bills from Villanova.

38
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,437
And Matt and Kevin
right behind her...

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,644
Hey, Sal, you need money, you come
to me, you hear what I'm sayin'?

40
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,855
Don't be moving that "h"
no more, Puss.

41
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,520
It's too risky.

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,327
I always wanted
a house by the ocean.

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,237
Maybe in another life.

44
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,374
Ton'! Tony?

45
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,377
Hey, Paulie.

46
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,008
We gonna go see your boat?

47
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,842
Nah, I'm just...

48
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,806
thinking about
our former friend.

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,091
Who?

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,601
Him?

51
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,765
Not me,

52
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,558
never.

53
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,362
Me and Jackie met him
down here in '95,

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,692
when he got back from Boca.

55
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,778
Oh, yeah, that crazy
shit with your uncle.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,658
Junior hijacked Jackie's truck.

57
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,943
What about it?

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,828
I should've seen it
then, that's all.

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,581
Don't waste another second
on that rat fuck, Ton'.

60
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,708
I'd kill him again if I could.

61
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
Tommy Angeletti,

62
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,878
he's doing a re-bar
at the Esplanade.

63
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,293
Yeah?

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,884
He's into me for 100 large
on college basketball.

65
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,925
Now Ralphie's holding up
the contractor for more money.

66
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,388
He's got the site
shutdown on a strike.

67
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,553
Angeletti can't work.

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,106
Paulie, your fuckin' book

69
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,359
against millions gonna
roll in off the Esplanade?

70
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,191
I figured you'd take his side.

71
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,400
But, Ralphie
shouldn't come across

72
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,156
with a couple of
no-show electrician jobs?

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,516
I shouldn't get something
outta this fuckin' esplanade?

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,872
Alright, I'll talk to him.

75
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,371
Oh, good, you're up.

76
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,099
I just got the digital
video for Meadow.

77
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,174
It's three down, three to go.

78
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,256
Plus, the scooter is ready,
but you're gonna have to pick it up.

79
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,636
It's on my list.

80
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,217
You're not gonna like this
next bit of news, either.

81
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,974
Janice is insisting on cooking
Christmas dinner this year.

82
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,976
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day?

83
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,182
I'm doing Christmas Eve.

84
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,864
You wanna turn her
loose on shellfish?

85
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,019
She's determined to cook
goose on Christmas Day.

86
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,774
<i>Why '2</i>

87
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,776
Well, her impulses are right,
she's over here all the time.

88
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,154
She volunteered me to make
the gravy and the lasagna,

89
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,781
so, with everything else
I gotta do today,

90
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,612
I gotta bring half
my kitchen over there,

91
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,742
and she needs you because
the fuse box is on the fritz again.

92
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,779
Oh, fuck, come on, I'm busy.

93
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,197
What, I'm not?!

94
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,005
Well, I was feeling good,

95
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,517
all of a sudden,
I'm back to square one.

96
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,800
What do you mean?

97
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,382
I had another one of
those attacks this morning.

98
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,138
Not the whole thing,

99
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,554
but, it was right there,

100
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,768
under the surface,

101
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,810
that feeling like I got
ginger ale in my brain.

102
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,568
Are you taking your medication?

103
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,648
Not every day.

104
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,361
Is that what
the prescription says?

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,652
Another thing
to feel bad about.

106
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,411
Well?

107
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,994
Can you tell me
what led up to this?

108
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,373
You know my log,

109
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,876
I was supposed to write
everything down for you?

110
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,538
Look, it's just a list of shit
I gotta do for Christmas.

111
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,798
All the pressure
we put on ourselves

112
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,551
this time of the year.

113
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,468
I call it "Stressmas".

114
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,973
That's cute.

115
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,186
I was looking forward
to Christmas this year.

116
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,017
No shit.

117
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,299
Now, here I go, right back
in the fuckin' rabbit hole.

118
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,983
Okay, let's do the drill.

119
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,818
The attack, what preceded it?

120
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,302
Yesterday I went
down to the shore

121
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,359
to get my boat winterized.

122
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,994
What happened?

123
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,740
I started thinking
about this thing

124
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,284
that happened years ago.

125
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,999
I haven't thought about it
since it happened.

126
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,378
Tell me about it.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,041
I can't.

128
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,505
I see.

129
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,046
We're at one of
our favorite junctures.

130
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,015
Without going into specifics...

131
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,651
I can tell you it was
a friend of mine.

132
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,614
I found out he was working
for the federal government.

133
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,987
Enough said?

134
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,622
I see.

135
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,910
Am I ruining your Christmas?

136
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,498
<i>I' Be accepted a'</i>

137
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,709
A-major?

138
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,757
<i>L' By the lord a'</i>

139
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,966
E-major.

140
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,178
<i>♪ Rejected and abandoned ♪</i>

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,683
I don't know.

142
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,139
Do you think it's too down?

143
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,519
I mean, with the chorus,

144
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,521
"His blood cleans every stain"?

145
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,853
Oh, it's a great
mother-jumping lyric, Jan.

146
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,644
What are we sellin', Ajax?

147
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,312
"His blood cleans stains"?

148
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,649
my brother, I hope.

149
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,113
Shit, fuck.

150
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,205
Hey, you guys, come on in.

151
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,535
We're just working.

152
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,699
On the fuse box?

153
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,209
No, we're making a demo,

154
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,540
tryin' to get some
major label interest here.

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,462
God, the poor thing.

156
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,186
I'm not coming to eat here

157
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,063
unless this pig sty
is cleaned up!

158
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,099
It's my wrist, Tony.

159
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,315
And the Percodans
aren't even working anymore.

160
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,855
You got any rubber gloves?

161
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,489
I'll get started,

162
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,821
and we can work on the stock.

163
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,790
Whoa, your wrist,

164
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,917
I thought the doctor said
it was just a sprain.

165
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,995
Apparently, there's
nerve involvement.

166
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,539
I may need an operation.

167
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,256
From the Russian?

168
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,424
It was the worst
night of my life,

169
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,765
but, it led me to Jesus.

170
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,555
Come on, Janice,
when's the last time

171
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,520
you went to a prayer meetin'?

172
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,352
I know.

173
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,942
And, Aaron and I don't
even sleep together anymore,

174
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,982
but in a larger sense,

175
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,119
Christianity's brought
about a business, with this CCM.

176
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,620
The what?

177
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,827
Christian contemporary, Tony,
ohh!

178
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,747
It's the fastest growing
marketing sector

179
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,456
in the music business today.

180
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,745
Here.

181
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,751
You knocked over
your drink, honey.

182
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,214
Ugh...

183
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,593
Really hurts, huh?

184
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,223
Yeah.

185
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,975
Janice!

186
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,544
Ooh, here's a branch.

187
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,983
I don't see the rest
of the tree.

188
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,336
Fuck that philosophical shit.

189
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,585
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

190
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,048
What?

191
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,383
Oh, shit.

192
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,965
That is depressing.

193
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,226
I don't even wanna
fuckin' touch this thing.

194
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,556
Hey.

195
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,847
The wife sends her love.

196
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,230
How are ya, Ray?

197
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,686
How ya doin', Hesh?

198
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,021
Tony, guess what we found

199
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,155
in the bottom of
the Christmas box?

200
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,067
The Santa outfit.

201
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,328
You guessed!

202
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,578
Burn the fuckin' thing.

203
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,410
This is the first
Christmas in history

204
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,165
I remember him not bein' Santa.

205
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,416
Oh, big Pussy.

206
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,792
We were talkin' the other day

207
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,249
about that fat piece of shit.

208
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,790
When he got back from
Boca at Christmas of '95,

209
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,379
how he wasn't himself.

210
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,918
What happened to,

211
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,008
"not wasting your breath
on the cocksucker"?

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,922
Two-faced fuck!

213
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,808
To sell out your friends to save
your own ass, it's despicable.

214
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,890
That's one ride I would've
loved to have been along on.

215
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,099
Yeah, me too.

216
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,302
Enough of this shit,
put up the fuckin' decorations.

217
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,312
We still gotta find
somebody to play Santa.

218
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,363
Get the fuck outta here.

219
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,523
It's fitting, you know.

220
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,170
After all, it was your father
who started this whole tradition.

221
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,496
That's right, when Johnny boy busted
this place out and took it over,

222
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,952
and old man Satriale
put a bullet in his own head,

223
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,413
there was a lot
of sadness on the block.

224
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,248
Nothing a Christmas ham
couldn't fix.

225
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,127
Come on, T.

226
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,416
Fuckin' stop, alright?

227
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,004
Find somebody else to do it.

228
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,068
The big man! Come have drink.

229
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,483
Where's Slava?

230
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,696
Working probably.

231
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,329
Anthony...

232
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
How you doing?

233
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,706
How are ya?

234
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,629
You want somethin'?
Food?

235
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,165
No, we're just gonna talk.

236
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,755
Oh, high level.

237
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,045
Shh.

238
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,038
Looks like Valery's started
to celebrate Christmas early.

239
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,183
You don't know the half!

240
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,641
Russian Christmas don't
come till mid-January.

241
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,608
There's a quarter mil in there,

242
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,148
my own personal funds.

243
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,033
I'll send it to Moscow
with the IBM Thinkpads.

244
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,820
But, this time, I want
to use Promstrybank.

245
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,455
Anyway, they will send it
to the Isle of Man,

246
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,742
to your bank numbered account.

247
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,125
Agron...

248
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,713
Print out Mr. Soprano's wire transfers.

249
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,210
I'm already doing it.

250
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,129
Thanks.

251
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,717
Galina loved the Escalante,
by the way.

252
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,727
You think you can
get another one?

253
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,810
There is something, maybe,
you can help me with.

254
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,100
You tell me what it is,
I'll tell you if I can help.

255
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,400
I'm looking for this Russian,

256
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,280
he's a friend of
Svetlana Kirilenko,

257
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,861
you know, lrina's cousin.

258
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,585
The one-legged woman,
I know who she is.

259
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,953
But, I don't want her involved.

260
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,908
All I know about this guy
is he drives a livery cab,

261
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,076
and he wasn't very nice
to someone important to me.

262
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,790
Don't think another
thing about this.

263
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,081
I'll find him, I'll kick
the shit out of him.

264
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,716
No, no, no, I'm gonna do this.

265
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,592
This motherfucker's mine.

266
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,630
What happened to the Jarlsberg
that was here?

267
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,041
What, Sil?

268
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,254
Stop the music.

269
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,886
Cut, stop the music!

270
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,222
There was an entire wedge
of Jarlsberg

271
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,008
here this morning.
What happened to it?

272
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,176
I don't know.

273
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,343
Goddamnit!

274
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,910
Debbie had a rondelay
of French brie

275
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,292
missing from her
purse yesterday.

276
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,353
- In there?
- Uh-huh.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,253
Ever since we found that suit,

278
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,421
now I'm dreaming about
that fat rat bastard.

279
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,306
What about it?

280
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,559
We did the right thing.

281
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,549
You're startin' to worry me.

282
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,765
You got a problem?

283
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,809
'95.

284
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,319
I can't believe
I didn't see it.

285
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,240
I had a fucking lamp down here,
but meadow took it to school.

286
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,327
You think it was
down in Boca, though,

287
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,239
I mean, he was bringing
the shit in through there?

288
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,157
No, it wasn't Boca.

289
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,997
They didn't flip him in Boca.

290
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,661
He was down there for 24 hours

291
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,579
to set up the sit-down
with my uncle,

292
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,838
and I know, for a fact,

293
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,397
he was with my uncle
the whole time.

294
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,005
It was the sit-down.

295
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,551
<i>Simpson himself attended
Barbieri's deposition,</i>

296
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,010
<i>but made no comment.</i>

297
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,016
<i>Next week, Simpson
faces another challenge,</i>

298
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,052
<i>the Goldman attorney
is seeking access...</i>

299
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,892
I'm saturated with it.

300
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,900
<i>In anticipation of
collecting punitive damages...</i>

301
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,110
Corrado.

302
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,365
John.

303
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,824
- Where's Bonpensiero?
- He's not here yet.

304
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,614
He supposed to be here.

305
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,874
He brokered the fuckin' thing.

306
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,372
Hey, I'm here.

307
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,288
What do you think? I'm gonna
let 'em hurt my only uncle?

308
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,172
- No.
- Sit down.

309
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,884
Where the fuck were you?

310
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,096
You better have a good excuse
for why you're still alive.

311
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,012
I'm sorry, skipper,
it'll never happen again.

312
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,698
I hope nobody called
the house, though.

313
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,224
I told Ange I was with you.

314
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,188
My goomar's mother, we were
in the hospital all night,

315
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
T.l.A., that's
a small stroke,

316
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,613
she lost use of her left hand.

317
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,865
It's coming back now,
but, I didn't eat...

318
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,901
Did you get laid?

319
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,535
Yeah.

320
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,741
We should've known, right then,

321
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,375
when he was M.l.A.
From that sit-down.

322
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,250
That's all the time you need.

323
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,505
When they flip somebody,

324
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,624
they try to get him
back on the street right away,

325
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,128
that very day.

326
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,263
So, you don't
have time to think.

327
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,845
Sil, what are you gettin'
your goomar for Christmas?

328
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,771
Cash, that's the only thing
that shuts her up

329
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,390
about bein' alone
over the holidays.

330
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,933
Michelle likes "ice".

331
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,067
I'm getting a piece
from a Jew in the city.

332
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,358
T, what are you gettin'
your new goomar?

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,147
She did me a favor.

334
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,566
She went to Morocco
over the holidays.

335
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,154
On her own?
She paid for it?

336
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,364
Yeah.

337
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,618
She went to Morocco?

338
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,621
Who is she, Bada Bing Crosby?

339
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,623
She's not one of those girls.

340
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:22,333
She's got a real job. She sells
Mercedes, smart, gorgeous...

341
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,247
too good to be true.

342
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,917
Speaking of which,
who's that piece of ass?

343
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,429
Oh, Madonn', look who it is.

344
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,555
It's the miracle of Christmas.

345
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,719
Next the blind will see,

346
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,978
and the lame will walk.

347
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,320
So, how is everything here
so far, tonight?

348
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,857
Much better now
that we've cast our glims

349
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,616
on you, sweetheart.

350
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,867
How you doin', 'Mainy?

351
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,619
Fine, Tony-oni.

352
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,331
Listen...

353
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,038
I thought you'd wanna know.

354
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,795
Two guys over there,
at that table...

355
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,955
Yeah?

356
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,499
I think they're FBI.

357
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm kidding.

358
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,010
I'm kidding, enjoy.

359
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,479
He's ready.

360
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,533
You are a hypocrite.

361
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,160
That's what you are.

362
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,195
You vilify a man
behind his back,

363
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,364
and then you smile in his face.

364
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,788
Something's gotta keep
the customers coming back

365
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,706
and it's not gonna be your
mooshata raviolis, lately.

366
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,630
Hey.

367
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,469
Charmaine...

368
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,508
Sometimes we're forced
to work the same shift.

369
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,394
Your wife, her ass
may be improved Artie, but...

370
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,226
Hey, hey, hey, come on, Sil.

371
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,313
She's over here
joking about the FBI.

372
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,072
Since when is that funny?

373
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,365
Yeah.

374
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,116
No, wait, hold on a minute.

375
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
Go ahead.

376
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,589
Alright, great.

377
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,508
Yeah...

378
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,761
Merry Christmas to you, too.

379
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,219
Mr. Valdez?

380
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,638
That's me.

381
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,112
I know you.

382
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,152
You look like maybe someone,
I don't know...

383
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,242
He's the designata drive.

384
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,405
Me?

385
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,574
no, you the designata drive.

386
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,789
No, no, you, you, it's you.

387
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,499
- You!
- No.

388
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,881
Airport Ramada, right?

389
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,086
Yeah.

390
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,250
Yeah, let's go, c'mon.

391
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,431
How was dinner?

392
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,598
Good.

393
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,018
Was Charmaine there?

394
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,437
Yep.

395
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,856
She looks good, doesn't she?

396
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,774
What, are you disappointed?

397
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,445
Her husband dumped her, you thought
she was gonna look like a krull?

398
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,238
A krull?

399
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,659
A crone, a troll, I don't know.

400
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,084
Holiday traffic.

401
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,046
My head is
clanging like a bell.

402
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,630
I got the scooter.

403
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,229
<i>Yay!!</i>

404
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,439
<i>Hello Bedford Falls!</i>

405
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,649
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

406
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,233
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

407
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,114
Enough already.

408
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,241
<i>Merry Christmas, George.</i>

409
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,153
Santa, we still
haven't got one.

410
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,492
You wanna do it?

411
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,531
Me, what do I know about it?

412
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,120
I don't have kids.

413
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,331
You don't have to,
Santa doesn't have any kids.

414
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,915
Yeah, that's strange,

415
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,831
that Mr. and Mrs. Claus
didn't have kids of their own.

416
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,092
Probably why they got
into it in the first place.

417
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,593
I used to think
the elves were their kids.

418
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,504
They were running
a sweatshop over there.

419
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,047
There was something on TV,

420
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,385
the original elves were ugly,

421
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,892
traveled with Santa
to throw bad kids a beatin',

422
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,769
and he gave the good ones toys.

423
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,225
The fuckin' Grinch.

424
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,058
Maybe that's where
they got the idea.

425
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,272
And fuckin' Dr. Seuss
ripped it off.

426
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,154
That Grinch, man,
that's where the money is.

427
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,360
A couple hundred mil.

428
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,400
Put Jim Carrey
in the motherfucker.

429
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,738
Tony...

430
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,278
Hey!

431
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,162
I got stuff for
the party, toys.

432
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,322
From me and junior.

433
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,087
They're not wrapped, but this way
they can see what they're getting.

434
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,706
Tell junior thank you.

435
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,128
What?

436
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,421
Ho-fuckin'-ho.

437
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,219
You're right.

438
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,929
What are you talking about?

439
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,092
You wanna play Santa Claus
at the party this year?

440
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,562
No, I can't do that.

441
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721
Why not?

442
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,687
I don't know, I don't know how.

443
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,477
What's to know? You ask 'em
what they want for Christmas,

444
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,022
you give 'em a nice toy,
and that's the end of it.

445
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,282
- No, not me, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

446
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,987
- I can't!
- Why not?

447
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,823
I'm shy.

448
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,875
The boss of this
family told you

449
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,502
you're gonna be Santa Claus,

450
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,708
you're Santa Claus.

451
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,668
So, shut the fuck up about it.

452
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,556
<i>A strange and macabre

453
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,938

Aaron, honey, honey?

472
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,764
Yeah?

473
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,519
I think I know what's
missing from the song.

474
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,153
It's the brother concept.

475
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,313
He ain't heavy?

476
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,027
No, I mean, not exactly.

477
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,741
Maybe we can try
to get something down.

478
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,576
Jan, you're crying.

479
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,788
Sometimes we really
don't see our loved ones.

480
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,465
Hi, whatcha doing?

481
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,053
Just enjoying the tree.

482
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,601
I love this time of year.

483
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,512
Me, too.

484
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,529
You're home early.

485
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,782
Hunter went into
the city with Hadley.

486
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,457
So, where's Jackie tonight?

487
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,084
He had to go visit a friend
of his in the hospital.

488
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,415
Oh, no, who?

489
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,330
Someone from school,
they think it's appendicitis.

490
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,498
Oh, my God.

491
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,966
So, you and Jackie
are getting pretty close, huh?

492
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,727
That new angel
looks really great.

493
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,407
That's what he said.

494
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,660
Wanna see 50 GS?

495
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,819
Holy shit!

496
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,078
What is that, sapphires?

497
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,740
Yeah, my wife better like it.

498
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,158
Wild Turkey, neat.

499
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,258
How you doin'?

500
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,919
Fine. How are you?

501
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,512
Carmela was right,

502
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,718
you look great.

503
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,888
Thank you.

504
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,450
I'm trying to
give you a compliment.

505
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,720
Well, don't.

506
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,184
What's your fuckin' problem?

507
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,270
All these years, I've sat here
and I kept my mouth shut.

508
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,401
I didn't want you and
your boys comin' in here.

509
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,812
And look what happened,

510
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,696
look what you've
done to my husband.

511
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,607
Artie?
I'm trying to help him.

512
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,774
Yeah, well, good luck,

513
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,739
because he's a friggin' mess.

514
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,825
Let's get the fuck outta here.

515
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:22,993
Where to?

516
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,003

00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,290

00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,866
Put your hands up,
put your hands up!

538
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,029
No... please.

539
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,619
C'mon, you fuck!

540
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,332
You fuckin' pussy
piece of shit.

541
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,735
All I did was tell your old man
what a good kid you were,

542
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,248
and all you do
is fuckin' hurt me.

543
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,042
I'm sorry!

544
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,469
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,888
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,842
What's this?

547
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,349
Hmm?

548
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,180
Nice.

549
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

550
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,441
You bottomed out.

551
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,526
What do you mean?

552
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,206
You bottomed out.

553
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
I wish I could get up
at 11:30 every morning

554
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,887
after being out all night,
God knows where.

555
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,354
Stop with the pots and pans.

556
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,890
Where were you last night?

557
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,230
Nowhere, I wasn't anywhere.

558
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,736
I was the monogamy
poster boy, swear to God.

559
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,397
Oh, please.

560
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,660
Well, I break up with
the so-called Russian whore,

561
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,286
I'm towing the line,

562
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,697
and this is the thanks I get!

563
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,036
What about Charmaine?

564
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,576
Charmaine?

565
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,210
Mm-hmm, I know
all about you.

566
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,370
What?

567
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,254
I didn't do anything.

568
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,585
Yeah, you did in high school.

569
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,295
High school?

570
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,176
Don't try to deny it.

571
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,554
Oh, okay, high school, okay.

572
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,965
Her husband dumps her and
she never looked so good?

573
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,974
You gotta ask yourself why.

574
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,136
I didn't do nothing.

575
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,475
I didn't do nothing!

576
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,107
It's too late. I don't believe
anything you say.

577
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,401
My wife had her doubts
about Jackie Jr...

578
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,868
and all along I kept defending
the little two-faced prick.

579
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,700
Do you feel responsible
for their relationship?

580
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,295
Meadow thinks she'd still be
going out with the Oreo cookie

581
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,956
if it wasn't for me.

582
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,296
Well, that's true, isn't it?

583
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,841
The question is, what am I
gonna do about Jackie?

584
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,051
Should I tell my wife?

585
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,262
Meadow, Jesus, she's...

586
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,853
It'd break her heart
if she knew.

587
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,732
On another subject,

588
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,492
I was thinking about
what we were talking about

589
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,324
last time you were here.

590
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,741
You know, your friend who was working
for the federal government?

591
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,909
Granted I get
most of my information

592
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,044
from the movies
and Bill Curtis.

593
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,256
But I was thinking...

594
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,678
They're around
the block out there.

595
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,893
Biggest one yet.

596
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,307
Where's the friggin' beard?

597
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,976
I saw it in the box.

598
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,064
It's gotta be there.

599
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,695
Even without padding,

600
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,902
the suit's too small
on this fatso.

601
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,491
Motherfucker.

602
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,449
What, Ton'?

603
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,162
He was wearing a wire...

604
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,836
when he came to the party

605
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,253
he already had the suit on.

606
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,084
Alvin!

607
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,298
Okay!

608
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:28,932
<i>♪ Christmas,
Christmastime is here I'</i>

609
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,476
Hey, look at this.

610
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,933
Oh...!

611
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
You been walking around
like that?

612
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,107
Boosting salvation army
kettles now.

613
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,768
Kevin, go make me a sandwich.

614
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:40,936
Okay, dad.

615
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,319
He's a method actor.

616
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,679
Getting into character like Al.

617
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,315
Yeah...

618
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,655
"it was you, Fredo."

619
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,366
Look at that,
don't even need a pillow.

620
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,372
Hey!
Watch the suit!

621
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,367
He can't make a joke?

622
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,377
What, are you
Mr. Sensitive over here?

623
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,834
Chrissy, ashtrays.

624
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,174
Tony...

625
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,638
this problem

626
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,179
with the red-tag garbage dumping
in Paden City...

627
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,437
Fuckin' Christmas,

628
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,348
he wants to
talk about medical waste?

629
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,564
I just want to double-check that the
way is paved for us to go down there,

630
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,774
we reached out to EPA guy
like we told Barone.

631
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,985
That reminds me, Tony,
Dick called this morning.

632
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,147
I'm fuckin' talkin' and
stop fuckin' interruptin'!

633
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,032
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- Fuck you!

634
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,158
Hey, hey, hey!

635
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,743
Take it easy! Ton'.

636
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,946
- What's the matter with you?!
- The fuck with you.

637
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,541
Jesus Christ.

638
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,457
Oh, it's as cold as
your sister's tit out there.

639
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,920
You should see the crowd
of little people.

640
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,381
Jackie Jr.,
how you doin', huh?

641
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,841
You look great.

642
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,507
Hey, Jackie, tell 'em what you told
me in the car on the way over here.

643
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,596
Come on, the capital of Canada.

644
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,385
The kid's got it up here.

645
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,847
Give me your coat, c'mon.

646
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,312
Crissy, let 'em in
for chrissake.

647
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,482
One, two, three, four,

648
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,863
open up the stupid door!

649
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,159
Go see Santa,

650
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,117
right this way.

651
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,701
Ho, ho, ho!

652
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,413
Merry Christmas,
come on in, children!

653
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,543
Don't be afraid,
c'mon, sweetheart.

654
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,954
Come sit on Santa's lap.

655
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,293
Oh...!

656
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,551
Have you been a good girl?
What do you want for Christmas?

657
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,552
I want a new doll
and a kitchen.

658
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,713
You want a new doll
and a kitchen.

659
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,881
Here's something, Dad.

660
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,470
I mean, Santa.

661
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,227
My little elf here's
got a little snow on the brain.

662
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,386
He called me Dad.

663
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,647
You like it?
Big enough to be your sister.

664
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,022
Merry Christmas.

665
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,183
Thank you, Santa.

666
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,567
Oh, how cute.

667
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,943
Who's next?

668
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,776
C'mon, don't be shy,
ho, ho, ho!

669
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,276
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

670
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,070
Next in line, we got
a lotta people to go, c'mon.

671
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,409
What do you want?

672
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,290
Merry Christmas.

673
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,450
Wait a minute.

674
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,897
I gotta give you
a present, here.

675
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,004
C'mon, single file over here!

676
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,254
C'mon, next one in line!

677
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,417
It would kill him to say
"Ho, ho, ho"?

678
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,584
You were just here.

679
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,752
I was not.

680
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,959
Yeah, you were, you were
on my lap five minutes ago.

681
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,048
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

682
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,615
Now you're going on Santa's list
and you're getting nothing!

683
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,851
Fuck you, Santa!

684
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,887
Hey!
Hey!

685
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,980
Gregorio!

686
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,641
How dare you talk
that way to Santa.

687
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,606
He never talks
that way at home.

688
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,487
My friend, you don't talk
that way to Santa.

689
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,069
Get back there,
tell Santa you're sorry.

690
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,654
Go on.

691
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,662
I'm sorry, Santa.

692
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,868
That's better.

693
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,454
I don't care, you are punished.

694
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,878
What the hell's
wrong with you, Bobby?

695
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,132
You got kids of your own.

696
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,463
I didn't wanna do this.

697
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,627
Shyness is a curse.

698
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,922
Why don't you lighten up
a little bit? It's Christmas.

699
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,929
<i>C' mere, honey.</i>

700
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,765
Don't be scared of Santa.

701
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,224
C'mon, there you go.

702
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,937
Next year he goes
to Santa school.

703
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,851
Fuckin' ho hum, if you ask me.

704
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,190
<i>I don't miss Pussy's</i>
fake <i>fuckin' good cheer,</i>

705
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,354
tell you the truth.

706
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,319
Let him stay with the fish.

707
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,990
Why'd you go to
that psychic last year?

708
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,996
Since you don't
dwell on this shit.

709
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,748
That was different.

710
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,874
Chrissy was shot.

711
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,285
That was a paranormal event.

712
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,747
What the fuck
are you talking about?

713
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,753
That psychic told you those guys were
haunting you. The guys that you...

714
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,926
Pussy, I loved that cocksucker
like a brother

715
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,385
and he fucked me in the ass.

716
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,562
That's the difference
between Puss and the others.

717
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,721
Him you loved.

718
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,437
The world don't run on love.

719
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,272
He was a rat bastard.

720
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,394
One thing you got to admit,

721
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,188
he made a great Santa Claus.

722
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,356
He did.

723
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,742
In the end, fuck Santa Claus.

724
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,545
Another sweater.

725
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,875
That's from Nana.

726
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,257
You'll tell her how much you like it.

727
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,544
Who could that be so early?

728
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,132
Let me see, maybe it'll fit me.

729
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,593
It's not bad,
better than last year.

730
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,346
Jackie Jr., hi.

731
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,886
Merry Christmas.

732
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,180
Merry Christmas, Aunt Carm.

733
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,269
It's okay if I come in?

734
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,025
We're just
opening our presents.

735
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,324
Merry Christmas, Ton'.

736
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,704
Good morning.

737
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,992
Merry Christmas.

738
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,874
These are from Mom
for everybody.

739
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,457
This is for you.

740
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,376
Wow, thank you.

741
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,886
Let me get your present.

742
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,842
No, you can open
yours first if you want.

743
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,381
Okay.

744
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,736
This is so beautiful, Jackie,

745
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,271
thank you.

746
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,439
There's something on the back.

747
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,990
"To M.S. from J.A.

748
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,075
I will
always be true."

749
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,241
Oh, Jackie.

750
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,549
I'll be right back.

751
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,219
C'mere, let me see that.

752
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,191
Can I talk to you?

753
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,613
I flunked out of Rutgers.

754
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,247
I'm sorry, I know I fucked up.

755
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,700
I got distracted this year
by things.

756
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,747
Ralph said I was probably
wasting my time

757
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,133
- if I didn't have the aptitude.
- Ralph?

758
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,885
You know, he didn't
go to school,

759
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,205
and look at the money he was
making when he was my age.

760
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,931
And the piece,

761
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,933
my car got broken into a couple
of times at the frat house,

762
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,139
so Ralph gave it to me.

763
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,564
It was fuckin' stupid,
I know it.

764
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,976
But Tony, I'm gonna
be alright now.

765
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,645
I'm gonna design men's suits.

766
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,189
Meadow thinks I should
go to the Fashion Institute.

767
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,609
I really think I could be good
if I applied myself.

768
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,995
You bullshit me
and you betray my daughter.

769
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,870
I'm sorry.

770
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,876
I'm sorry.

771
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,712
Go back inside.

772
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,008
I'm gonna be frank on this.

773
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,632
I haven't decided
what to do with you.

774
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,516
Comin' through!

775
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,527
You can't stay?

776
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,735
I still have to
give you your present.

777
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,525
I'm driving Mom up
to the home to see Grandma.

778
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,916
Thank you for
my beautiful necklace.

779
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,675
Merry Christmas.

780
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,177
Merry Christmas.

781
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,267
Go be with your family
and open your presents.

782
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,602
Love you.

783
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,532
Oh, my God.

784
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,741
Lemme see, Mom.

785
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,904
Look at this.

786
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,369
Wow.

787
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,455
Mmm.

788
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,290
Well, uh,

789
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,923
this is gonna seem
really stupid after that,

790
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,085
but it's your turn, Dad.

791
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,719
This is for you.

792
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,927
I didn't think you were
gonna get me anything.

793
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,093
After...

794
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,261
It's Christmas.

795
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,809
Thank you.

796
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,066
Come on, open it.

797
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,651
What is it?

798
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,781
Who knows.

799
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,579
"Big Mouth Billy Bass",
what is that?

800
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,490
Oh, those are good.

801
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,750
Wait till you see what it does.

802
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,035
What does it do?

803
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,454
You'll see.

804
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,873
I know I give you
a lot of stuff, Dad,

805
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,507
I don't know
what you do with it,

806
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,008
but,

807
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,129
I want to see this
on your desk, promise?

808
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,843
Yeah.

809
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,567
Oh my God. That is hilarious.

810
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,853

811
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,487
Wait, mom.

812
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,616

813
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,703

814
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,033
What a riot.

815
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,075

816
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,618
It's cute.

817
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,377
Thanks, honey.
