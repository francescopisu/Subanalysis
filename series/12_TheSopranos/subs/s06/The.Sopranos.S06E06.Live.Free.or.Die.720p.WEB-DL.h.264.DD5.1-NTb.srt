1
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,379
- I'm laying out. You coming?
- The UV index is ten.

2
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,591
Jesus, we don't do anything.
We don't eat, we don't go out.

3
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:11,262
- God knows, we don't do anything else.
- Is that all you ever think about, sex?

4
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,933
All I ever think about?
You haven't fucked me in over a year.

5
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:18,395
Blood sugar, I told you, the weight loss.

6
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:24,484
Good. Fine! Skin cancer!

7
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,493
What's up?

8
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:39,290
- Thing we talked about at the wedding.
- Rusty.

9
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:43,545
- You made the call to Italy.
- Our friend over there's gonna fit him for a suit.

10
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:46,339
She's sending over two of her best tailors.

11
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:50,427
- So I should meet 'em at the airport?
- No, they'll call you when they arrive.

12
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:55,223
Now, you hook 'em up with a third party.
Get 'em some scissors.

13
00:03:56,474 --> 00:04:01,021
- This is smart, Tone, the more I think about it.
- Glad you approve.

14
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:04,566
Anybody taking a look,
there's nothing linking us to it.

15
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:07,360
- Good seeing you.
- There he is.

16
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,034
Listen, come here a minute.

17
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:20,665
- About the other day...
- I'm fine. A couple of stitches. You know.

18
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:23,710
My fucking temper, you know?

19
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,421
No, no. It's OK, really.

20
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:28,923
Take it.

21
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,592
Thanks.

22
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:34,971
Look, Tone, I don't remember
slamming the refrigerator door,

23
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:40,643
but Carlo told me and my dad, I never
should've raised my hands to you, I'm sorry.

24
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:43,813
As long as you realise.

25
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:49,569
It basically became the same thing every day.

26
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:54,824
Coffee, couple lines of meth,
smooth that out with a shot of Jameson.

27
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:59,162
And that was just to drive the kids to school.

28
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:06,753
Then one day I fell asleep at work
and forgot about Gracie's recital.

29
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:14,010
Human frailty. It makes me sick sometimes.

30
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:23,186
- Chris, right?
- Should I know you?

31
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,064
Kevin Mucci, Yonkers.

32
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:30,068
- We met at the Trotters. Sal lacuzzo's cousin.
- Right. Hey.

33
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,155
- Yonkers, what, are you lost?
- My ex's birthday at the Red Robin in Clifton.

34
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:38,535
- I need a meeting to make it through that shit.
- I hear that.

35
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:44,624
So I saw my cousin this week. It turns out
he ran into a friend of yours, the big guy, Vito.

36
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:51,006
- And?
- He was in a fag bar, dancing with a guy.

37
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,925
Get the fuck out!

38
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,523
Right, Joey, use your head.

39
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,321
- You are not gonna fucking believe this.
- Vito Spatafore's an ass-muncher.

40
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:18,742
- What did you just say?
- I'm sorry, it's true.

41
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:23,204
We ran into this kid.
Vito was spotted in a fag bar in New York.

42
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:07,857
- Ni kommer fan inte tro det.
- Vito Spatafore Ã¤r en rÃ¶vsnaskare.

43
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:11,616
- Vad sa du?
- TyvÃ¤rr, men det Ã¤r sant.

44
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,672
- He's a married man.
- With a goomah.

45
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:36,968
All right, back up a second.
What did the kid say exactly?

46
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,096
- The kid's cousin Sal lacuzzo.
- From Yonkers, I know him.

47
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:44,142
Sal was at this place in the city,
supposedly on business,

48
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:47,645
he saw Vito holding hands
with a guy in nipple rings.

49
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,815
You're leaving out the best part.

50
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:57,781
He wore a motorcycle outfit, like the guy in the
Village People, with the leather hat and vest.

51
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,532
Chaps too.

52
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:06,873
I don't know. Fucking slander, ask me.

53
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,920
- Let's take this in the back.
- Yeah, that's what Vito did!

54
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,215
You can go.

55
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:20,387
If it was me this kid
was spreading rumours about,

56
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:22,389
he'd have something up his own ass

57
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,766
and it wouldn't be no cock, either.

58
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:28,728
That's the point, though.
This guy Sal, I know him.

59
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,482
- He's a friend of ours.
- I fucking called it, long time ago.

60
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,610
- You knew Vito was a ricchion'?
- Yes.

61
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,279
- When?
- I never said it, but I knew.

62
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:41,032
Get the fuck out.
Enough of this rush to judgment.

63
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:44,619
For all we know,
this fucking Sal guy's got a hard-on for Vito.

64
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:49,124
You think this is funny?
There's a man's reputation at stake here.

65
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,042
A married man, with kids.

66
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,129
That don't mean shit. Elton John was married.

67
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,881
Yeah, Rock Hudson too. I think.

68
00:07:56,923 --> 00:08:00,719
So what do we gotta do,
actually see him take it in the ass?

69
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,098
Get Vito on the phone.

70
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:12,397
He called me the other night.
3:00 in the morning, after the wedding.

71
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,982
And?

72
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:17,569
Honestly, it was weird.
He wanted to know what was going on.

73
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,321
He was fucking fishing, see if we heard.

74
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:27,287
- Straight to voice mail.
- Tone, I mean, he represents us.

75
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:30,832
I won't condemn him off the word
of some douchebag from Yonkers.

76
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:35,295
- I could care less, basically.
- Yeah? Maybe you're a flambé.

77
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:40,342
Fucking nauseating! It was up to me,
I'd drag Vito behind my fucking car right now!

78
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:43,720
Take it easy, fucking Judge Roy Bean!

79
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:46,014
One of my bar girls knows his goomah.

80
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:51,061
We'll check with her.
Maybe she's seen him and knows where he is.

81
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,196
Think about it, though, Tone.
Sudden weight loss.

82
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,075
- AIDS?
- Nobody's got AIDS!

83
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:08,703
I don't wanna hear that word in here again!

84
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:14,501
Federal Prosecutor's office won't tell you
why your son's being held?

85
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,004
Or where. It has been four days now
since he's been arrested.

86
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:21,132
- We have no money for a lawyer.
- How did you hear about the centre?

87
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:24,969
- You will write the...
- Habeas corpus? I'm not an attorney yet.

88
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,306
I'm a volunteer assistant.
An attorney will file the writ.

89
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:32,936
- He is a good boy.
- The FBI went to his school and took him.

90
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:36,898
- This is America?
- It's not easy to be Muslim now.

91
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,985
They wouldn't let Afaf skate at the rink
unless she removed her headscarf.

92
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,905
- You're kidding me. Why?
- Insurance, they said.

93
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,199
It might fall off and someone could trip.

94
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:52,330
If she had been wearing a yarmulke,
it would've been a different story, you can bet.

95
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,542
They're poor, hardworking people.

96
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,293
- Finn, not eating?
- Coffee's good.

97
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:01,297
The government
is completely fucking this family over.

98
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,427
When could she use that kind of language
in this house with immunity?

99
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:08,304
I'm telling Mom about people
that came into the office.

100
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:12,684
Was it a crack whore trying to get
her kids back for the welfare money?

101
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:17,230
It was a family from Afghanistan who fled
the Taliban and sweated out visa lotteries

102
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,859
in a refugee camp, and hold down three jobs.

103
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,698
You think it's funny? The FBI snatched their
son like we're some third-world dictatorship.

104
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,993
- Pretty scary.
- There must have been some reason.

105
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,370
- Like he's a terrorist, maybe.
- 9/11, 9/11.

106
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:37,667
Bush is using it to erode our constitutional
protections and you're falling for it.

107
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,045
I voted for him.

108
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:43,340
Right, you don't relate to black people
clinging to logs.

109
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:50,013
You oughta chill out about some of this.

110
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:12,285
Let me ask you something,
those two Arabs with the credit cards.

111
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,163
- Fazool and whatever his name is.
- Yeah?

112
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:21,419
Do you think there's a chance they could be...
I don't know, al-Qaedas, something like that?

113
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,219
You know, at one point, it did cross my mind.

114
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,012
Yeah, and?

115
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,723
I don't think so.

116
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:36,267
They're gun nuts, but the smaller guy, Ahmed,

117
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,605
when those Danish cartoons got published,
he was upset, but at the protestors.

118
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:46,236
He said he hated the cartoons, but that the
rioting would bring bad attention to Muslims.

119
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:51,950
And the other guy, Mohammed, his brother's
a government interrogator in Lebanon or Syria.

120
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:56,496
Plus Mohammed and his girlfriend have a dog,
a Springer spaniel.

121
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,335
I'm gonna get a coffee.

122
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:31,740
- Vito, what the fuck you doing?
- Tony's looking for you.

123
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,743
- For me?
- He's been calling for fucking days.

124
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:38,413
My goddamn phone. Jesus.
Everything all right?

125
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,834
- You tell us.
- I'm good. Tell Tony I'll call him.

126
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:45,003
It's better you come in.

127
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,466
Sure.

128
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,887
You go ahead and I'll follow you.

129
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:05,190
- Where the fuck...
- What are you doing?

130
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:08,360
Fucking finocch'!

131
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:12,655
Lying piece of shit!

132
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:15,033
Better not come around here no more!

133
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,435
You speak Ital, right?

134
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:48,441
Some friends coming over from Naples
paying a visit to a guy from New York.

135
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:52,237
- Who?
- The little guy in Ozone Park.

136
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,409
That's pretty high up.

137
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,205
Provide 'em a couple of dumb gats,
guidance on where to find him.

138
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,500
How do I get a hold of them?

139
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:10,171
Just leave your phone on.
Part two when it's done.

140
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,556
I hear fat Vito's been riding up
the Hershey Highway.

141
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,809
- Where did you get that?
- Come on.

142
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:27,939
Somebody started a joke. I won't mention
any names. There's no truth to it.

143
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,777
It's a fucking captain you're talking about.

144
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:39,075
People went to see him.
He was down the shore with his goomah.

145
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,202
So it's bullshit, then?

146
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:46,958
Soon as he saw 'em,
he took off like a bat out of hell!

147
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:51,212
- You didn't hear it from me.
- It could be a mid-life thing.

148
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,340
Sucking a cock?

149
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:02,265
Mr Spatafore, hey.
Marie's still at the hospital with her mom.

150
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:06,102
- Kids asleep?
- They went to sleep about an hour ago.

151
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,631
Fuck!

152
00:17:56,064 --> 00:18:00,026
- Hi. How are you doing?
- I need a room for the night.

153
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:04,614
- I don't have anybody down for a reservation.
- The sign said "Vacancy".

154
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:08,243
We have rooms.
We usually don't get walk-ins. Come in.

155
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:21,381
Glad to have you.
Slow here until the leaf-peepers show up.

156
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:24,009
- Let me show you where...
- I want to go to my room.

157
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,055
No problem. It's 140, breakfast included.
MasterCard or Visa.

158
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:32,559
- I'll pay cash.
- Well, we accept that, too.

159
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,146
But you can take care of it in the morning.

160
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,273
I'm just beat, that's all.

161
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,611
- My car broke down.
- On a night like this, too.

162
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,572
My stepson runs the tow service.

163
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:50,160
You want, early morning,
I can have your rig brought to the Mobil.

164
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,245
Yeah?

165
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,208
Black Cadillac. Route 228.

166
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:02,213
This is for you.

167
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,384
Have a good night.

168
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:13,475
Franklin Pierce room.
Up the stairs, first door to the right.

169
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,981
I was just over at the house.
Everything is gone.

170
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:46,026
- Which house are you referring to?
- The spec house.

171
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:52,323
The PVC, the shake roof shingles, even
that expensive lock on the shed is missing.

172
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:54,451
That's awful, Mel.

173
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:57,829
You don't know anything about this?

174
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:02,208
- You left it there to rot.
- I don't believe this.

175
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,962
- With my husband on his deathbed...
- Sarah Bernhardt.

176
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:09,215
...you picked through the place
like a vulture!

177
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:12,969
You said you'd straighten out the permits
and you never did!

178
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:16,556
- That is beside the point!
- What happened to my bundt pan?

179
00:21:16,598 --> 00:21:19,100
It was your fault the permits were denied!

180
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:22,937
You're a broken record, for God's sake,
that's what you are!

181
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,274
- Carmela, wait.
- No, let her go!

182
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:28,985
I've had a lifetime of her bullshit!

183
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:42,499
Gimme a coffee.

184
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,762
- National directory. City and state?
- Peterborough, New Hampshire.

185
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:58,640
The number for Angelo Di Piazza.

186
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:01,726
- Double Z.
- No number listed, sir.

187
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:06,981
- How about Roberta Di Piazza?
- Nothing for Roberta Di Piazza.

188
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:11,152
- Nothing, sir.
- Could you try Roberta Spatafore?

189
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:14,698
S-P-A-T-A-F-O-R-E.

190
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,951
I don't have anything for that listing, sir.

191
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:21,663
Look, I'm trying to find my cousin.
Could you search the whole state?

192
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,873
Searching.

193
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:26,042
I'm sorry, sir.

194
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:42,475
- What's good?
- First time here, try the johnnycakes.

195
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,645
- What's that?
- Pancake made with white cornmeal.

196
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:48,690
New England specialty. Where you from?

197
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,444
Scottsdale.

198
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:56,448
Well, they're delicious.
Little butter, local syrup.

199
00:22:57,323 --> 00:23:03,330
- OK, and gimme some of them Jimmy Deans.
- Our sausages are made in-house.

200
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:17,510
- How'd you guys make out in the storm?
- Lost our lights in the middle of Cold Case.

201
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:21,473
We thought we were gonna have
to talk to each other or read a book!

202
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,059
The usual, guys?

203
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,728
- Are we boring?
- Yeah, yeah.

204
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:39,366
Here's your johnnycakes.
I gotta warn ya, they're addictive.

205
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,994
They look good.

206
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:59,469
- You want more coffee?
- No, I'm coffeed out.

207
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,518
You don't say hello to your uncle?
- Hi, Uncle Sil.

208
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,235
Well, he ain't gonna show.
I'll just leave him these.

209
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:18,947
He said he'd be back from Vegas today.
I don't know.

210
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:27,622
You and Vito,
how are things going with you guys?

211
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:30,250
We have our ups and downs.

212
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:36,172
- And in the romance department?
- Excuse me?

213
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,885
What's this all about?

214
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,767
- It's awkward.
- No offence, I don't want to talk about this.

215
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,981
Vito's a good father and a loving husband.

216
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,984
But his mind is elsewhere.

217
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,404
He takes these unexplained powders.

218
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,407
He's got a goomah. I know all about it.

219
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,704
It's nothing. Forget about it.

220
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:15,754
If you hear from him, tell him I brought him
some Blood, Sweat & Tears tickets.

221
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,966
Backstage passes, too.

222
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:39,110
I'm telling ya, my business,
I'm around a lot of women.

223
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:41,446
That one ain't getting laid.

224
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,549
- Hello.
- Vito?

225
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:03,051
- You got him?
- Who?

226
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:04,719
Put Vito on the phone, asshole.

227
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:09,057
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Are you sucking his dick? Put him on.

228
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:13,228
- How 'bout I kick your ass, you fucking faggot?
- Yeah, telephone tough-guy.

229
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,980
- Put Vito on the phone!
- There ain't no Vito, man.

230
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,608
- I found the phone on the side of the road.
- What?

231
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,777
Hang on a second.

232
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:26,616
Where'd you find the phone?

233
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:28,284
Hello?

234
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,000
- You motherfucker!
- What happened?

235
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,296
Bob at the marina where Tony docks his boat
says he'll donate a sunset dinner cruise.

236
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:42,257
I'd bid 300 for that.

237
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,302
- I got seasick in Bermuda on one of those.
- Angie, finally.

238
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:49,055
Sorry. I had these sales reps in my office.

239
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:54,185
We're just going over the list for the silent
auction. We're up to about 7,500 bucks.

240
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:56,312
- Good, Artie.
- Ladies.

241
00:26:56,354 --> 00:26:58,940
Again? Why not a live auctioneer?

242
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:03,862
I got sea bream, beautiful.
Porcini-dusted ravioli...

243
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:08,241
I hate to be a pain, but I gotta get back.
Can we just let him cook?

244
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:10,452
Great, go for it.

245
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,583
- Where were we?
- Jesus Christ. He's always interrupting.

246
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:20,462
- People enjoy the silent auction.
- I thought our goal was to raise money.

247
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:25,216
I say we get 'em liquored up,
let 'em tear each other's throats out!

248
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,303
- Well...
- It's just an idea.

249
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:32,223
Anyhow, put me down for $2,000 worth
of bodywork and/or paint.

250
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:34,434
2,000? Ange.

251
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:38,563
So, did you hear about Vito and Marie?
Separated.

252
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:42,692
Sorry, I gotta take this.

253
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,528
- Hello?
- They were at the wedding. They seemed fine.

254
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,659
- Is that a beautiful fish or what?
- For God's sake, all right!

255
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,830
Can I just get some prosciutto melon to go?
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta get back.

256
00:27:55,872 --> 00:28:00,794
No, the quarter panel from the LeSabre, I said.

257
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:05,298
You didn't know he was gay?

258
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:13,807
Actually, I had him pegged
the whole time, but...

259
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:18,603
- He a close friend?
- And he's one of my most valuable guys.

260
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:21,064
He's ambitious, he's focused.

261
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:27,278
When I was in hospital, he helped Carmela
tremendously when we were strapped.

262
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,324
You've implied you have millions of dollars.

263
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:34,869
Your hospital stay was actually that costly?

264
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,788
Well, no, but...

265
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:45,797
- Is that the issue?
- You tell me. What is the issue?

266
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,884
He's a fag!

267
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,012
And?

268
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,848
- Now what am I supposed to do?
- About what?

269
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:59,477
I know it. They're born that way, right?
It's not their fault.

270
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:04,357
Frankly, I think they go about in pity
for themselves.

271
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,818
I don't think they see it as a fault.

272
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,155
In your circle, I'm sure you got all kinds of gays

273
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:14,117
and trans-whatevers of all stripes.

274
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,244
But not where I come from.

275
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,164
You personally...

276
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:23,918
how do you feel about homosexuality?

277
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,046
I find it disgusting.

278
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:30,091
Men kissing men, holding hands in the street.

279
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:34,971
Every fuckin' TV show now,
they rub your nose in it.

280
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,975
Although, that...

281
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:41,978
The lesbian thing with the...

282
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,314
Jennifer Beals...

283
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:46,608
it's not bad.

284
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:51,071
Is she a dyke in real life?

285
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:56,910
I don't give too much of a shit what people do
behind closed doors with consenting adults.

286
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:02,332
Although, don't forget, I'm a strict Catholic.

287
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,169
I agree with that Senator Sanitorium,

288
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:10,465
who says, if we let this stuff go too far,
pretty soon we'll be fucking dogs.

289
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:12,342
I hear a lot of ambivalence.

290
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:18,515
This guy that got outed, look,

291
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:23,436
the guys that work for me
are asking for head, his head.

292
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,146
What the fuck?

293
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:30,568
You know, him and me,
we're in the construction business.

294
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:33,405
Some of these union old-timers,
the contractors,

295
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:36,199
they're not gonna want to be seen with him.

296
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:40,286
And I'm talking huge deals,
major fucking dollars.

297
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:45,959
A lot of your circle must have done jail time.

298
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:50,255
They can't be strangers
to male-male sexual contact.

299
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:55,593
You get a pass for that.

300
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:59,139
Well, that's nice.

301
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:04,394
What are you gonna do?
There's no women there.

302
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,814
You're there five, ten years.

303
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:15,822
Just for the record,
my incarceration was very short-term

304
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:19,534
so I never had any need for any anal...
you know.

305
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:24,956
So this fellow who has been outed,
what's he saying?

306
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:30,420
You think I'm lying, don't you?
About when I was in jail.

307
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:34,007
I've given you no indication I think you're lying.

308
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,268
What the fuck, I suppose...

309
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,939
something inside me says, "God bless.

310
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,026
"Who gives a shit?"

311
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:58,948
I had a second chance. Why shouldn't he?

312
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,451
Part of your new outlook?

313
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:03,161
Maybe.

314
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:07,374
I salute it, then.

315
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,710
Tall fuckin' order, I'll tell you that.

316
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,379
How so?

317
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,092
You can talk about every day being a gift
and stopping to smell the roses,

318
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:21,221
but regular life's got a way of picking away at it.

319
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:25,225
Your house, the shit you own,
it drags you down.

320
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:29,104
Your kids, what they want.

321
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,147
One bad idea after another.

322
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,736
Just trying to work a cellphone menu
is enough to make you scream.

323
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:44,494
- There's some cold pasta.
- No, I ate already.

324
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,331
What's all that?

325
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:50,709
For the silent auction.

326
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,752
My busy little beaver.

327
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:56,464
Not really.

328
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:03,638
Look, Tone, I haven't wanted to bug you,
but before you got hurt,

329
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,726
you said you'd get that building inspector
to cut me some slack.

330
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,895
Yeah, right right. I will, later.

331
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,566
Come here.

332
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:18,445
No, I'm still not ready for that.

333
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:23,616
Last time I thought I tore something
from tensing my muscles.

334
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,413
No, I got something for that scar.

335
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,931
Vitamin E.

336
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:49,809
My facialist said it will help get the red out.

337
00:33:55,357 --> 00:33:58,109
You were right about my uncle, Carm.

338
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:01,780
All along.

339
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:05,325
Doesn't give me any pleasure, believe me.

340
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:09,245
I should have cut him out of my life.

341
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,415
I brought this all on myself.

342
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:16,336
You did not. Don't ever think that.

343
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:24,386
All this, you never once said "I told you so."

344
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,891
Accentuate the positive.

345
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:35,105
I wanted you to get better.

346
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:41,403
You know, my shrink

347
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,532
told me that

348
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:51,871
I stood by Junior through all his jealousy
and shit

349
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,336
trying to prove I'm a good guy

350
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:05,927
and that my mother
couldn't hate a good boy like that.

351
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:14,477
Imagine laying next to a guy 15 years and all
the time he's been playing for the pink team.

352
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,149
- Who told you? Tony swore me to secrecy.
- I'm not gonna burn my sources.

353
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,109
Anyway, it's all over the place.

354
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:25,905
Those children... Imagine when
they find out their father's a finocch'.

355
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:30,660
She's such a bright girl, Marie Spatafore.
Think she and Vito had some arrangement?

356
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:33,830
I just hope she gets herself tested.

357
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:39,461
Still, Vito?
He'd be, like, the last one you'd suspect.

358
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,713
Suspect of what?

359
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:44,299
Such a young lady!

360
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:49,888
She's working two jobs. Days she's interning
at Gendler, Lookstein, Abruzzo & Abruzzo.

361
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:54,351
- What about Vito?
- Nothing. Him and Marie are having problems.

362
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:01,066
- I can probably guess.
- Excuse me?

363
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:06,196
- I'm not going first.
- Do you know something?

364
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,957
He is possibly gay.

365
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:22,295
Finn saw him giving some guy a blow job.

366
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:25,423
- What?
- When Dad got him that job in construction,

367
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:29,511
Finn showed up early one morning
and saw Vito going down on a security guard.

368
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:32,889
- My God!
- He saw this?

369
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:36,476
- He had Finn all freaked out.
- Why didn't you say something?

370
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:38,770
Because Vito warned Finn not to.

371
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:46,277
- You gotta hear what Meadow told us.
- Mom!

372
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:48,822
The cat's out of the bag, Meadow.

373
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:56,454
It's Dr Yank 'em, the painless dentist.

374
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,624
- How you doing, kid?
- Hey, Tone.

375
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:08,133
Unfortunately, Finn here's got
some bad news, so listen up.

376
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:10,927
Sit down.

377
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,224
Tell 'em what you saw.

378
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:24,149
Don't be scared, it's all right.

379
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:03,646
Good morning.

380
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:34,010
Let me ask you a question.

381
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:39,224
Before he cornered you in the porta-potty,
when the security guard was sucking him off...

382
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:42,477
- One sec, it was the other way around.
- What?

383
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:48,316
Vito was blowing the security guard.

384
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:50,193
Son of a bitch!

385
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:54,072
Catchin', not pitchin'?

386
00:38:57,742 --> 00:39:02,789
- He's not gonna know I told you?
- You ain't gonna have no problem from Vito!

387
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:08,628
- What are you gonna do?
- It'll be OK. Get him to pay for some therapy.

388
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,755
Look, why don't you...

389
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:14,926
go out front, get yourself a sandwich?

390
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:17,512
Any kind you like. Soda.

391
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:24,394
When we're done here,
somebody will take you back. All right.

392
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:37,741
I wanna kill the fat faggot myself.
Be a fuckin' honour!

393
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,868
Cut off his pisciatil' and feed it to him.

394
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:44,706
- There can be no mistake now.
- I can't believe I stuck up for him!

395
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:49,336
- I feel like I've been stabbed in the heart.
- We can't have him in our social club.

396
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:53,757
- I mean, that much I do know.
- Social club? He's gotta go!

397
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:58,845
- I wanna think about it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

398
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:02,974
- What the fuck? What is there to think about?
- Sit down.

399
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:06,269
Fuck that! I'll say it again!
What is there to think about?

400
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:09,564
You gonna take care of his kids
after he's gone?

401
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:17,155
It's true. They didn't do nothing.
Poor little guys.

402
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:21,159
Now, sit down.

403
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:32,170
I'm sorry if I yelled, T.
It's just, how much more betrayal can I take?

404
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,676
Vito, a fag!

405
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,178
Big construction tycoon!

406
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,809
Tone, when he was talking about "greasing
the union," who knew that's what he meant?

407
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,691
All right, this stays in these four walls.

408
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,820
Am I understood?

409
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:04,327
- Phil, my God.
- You poor kid.

410
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,998
I know. I can't believe it myself.

411
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:14,087
I keep waiting for him to call. How long am I
meant to tell the kids he's away on business?

412
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:18,341
Fuckin' shitbag. I get my hands on him,
I'm gonna tear him limb from limb.

413
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:21,594
- Don't say that.
- You're my cousin he married.

414
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:24,764
Making a mockery of the whole sacrament.

415
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:31,688
But what do we really know?
I mean, maybe there were signs, but...

416
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,028
Vito Spatafore is a good man
and he's a wonderful dad.

417
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:43,992
Somebody sees something one time
and he's tossed aside like garbage?

418
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,913
That's why I'm here, honey.

419
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:54,336
There was confirmation through the grapevine.
Vito was seen in a car with a man.

420
00:41:55,962 --> 00:42:00,091
I don't want to get graphic beyond that.
The idea of it repulses me so much.

421
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,094
What confirmation? Who?

422
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:07,182
- The witness has no reason to lie.
- No...

423
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:11,353
We can't be in denial no more,
much as we love him.

424
00:42:14,397 --> 00:42:16,983
Where do you think
he might have gone, honey?

425
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,612
So we can get him back here,
get him to do something about it.

426
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:33,416
- Excuse me, Angie here?
- In the office.

427
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:37,671
We can get you anything you want,
sweetheart, air bags, chrome rims.

428
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:40,507
- Hi.
- Carm, hi.

429
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:46,179
Sorry, am I interrupting? I'm here for
the free bodywork certificates for the auction.

430
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:49,891
- That's right.
- But if you're busy...

431
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,852
This'll just take another sec.

432
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:55,146
OK, sure.

433
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:07,784
They were doing something
behind closed doors.

434
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:10,036
Angie's put money on the street.

435
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,164
- How do you know?
- Angie told me.

436
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:15,083
She didn't tell me.

437
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:21,172
Probably cos of Tony. Maybe he didn't
want you to know that. Me and my big mouth.

438
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:26,428
She's got enough money to do that?

439
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:33,560
Well, she's pretty successful
with that body shop so...

440
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:39,816
Our grandmothers did it.
Those were harder times, but a' salut', right?

441
00:43:41,192 --> 00:43:45,113
She was one of us,
now it's like she's one of them.

442
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,702
- You wanted to see me, Tone?
- Yeah.

443
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:52,620
Hey, Carlo.

444
00:43:56,207 --> 00:43:57,876
Sit down.

445
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:04,758
I'm putting you in charge of
all construction business, replacing Vito.

446
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,593
Holy shit!

447
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:13,391
The guys respect you across the board,
you done real good with the ports.

448
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,560
Thank you, Tone.

449
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:18,188
Jeez, I don't know what to say!

450
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:20,315
We'll have a drink.

451
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:23,652
Congratulations.

452
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,036
Listen, Tone...

453
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:39,751
since you think enough of me to give me
this responsibility, I'll be the one to say it.

454
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:42,420
All right, skip the preambles.

455
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:49,302
The guys in Vito's crew say if he was to come
back, they'll refuse to take orders from him.

456
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,389
They do?

457
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,308
Not only that...

458
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:01,189
a couple of the other captains
won't talk to him and I don't disagree.

459
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,149
Paulie especially.

460
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:08,113
Now that he's accepted it,
he's the most out for Vito's scalp.

461
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:13,076
Yeah, you should hear him, Tone.
He's goin' fuckin' mau-mau on the subject.

462
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:18,915
It's not their fucking decision
who they work with.

463
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,171
Let me tell you something. Vito, through sheer
hard work, turned himself into my best earner.

464
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:29,217
I don't even know if I'd have the new boat
without him.

465
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:33,638
- He's a come-from-behind kind of guy.
- That's true, but...

466
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,890
So I'm gonna burn that kind of dedication?

467
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,478
Hard to believe I couldn't get something more
out of him if he came back.

468
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,898
Stocks, offshore shit, I don't know.

469
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:49,446
Well, these other guys feel
an effort should be made

470
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:52,324
to find him and put him down
for the honour of the family.

471
00:45:52,365 --> 00:45:54,284
Please...

472
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,164
Certain people love the high drama -
like fuckin' high school girls.

473
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:03,460
Others I could name, they just can't wait
to whack somebody, anybody.

474
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:09,799
But some people feel
it's against our principles, Tony. A sin.

475
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:15,597
Carlo, let's be honest with ourselves here.

476
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:17,515
We all know Vito's not the first.

477
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,612
We're gonna do great things.

478
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,782
Jesus, thanks again, Anthony. Thank you.

479
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:08,191
What?

480
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:13,196
It's 2006.

481
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:16,366
There's pillow-biters in the Special Forces.

482
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:20,078
Let me just ask you, Tone.

483
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:24,124
Sake of argument.

484
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:26,251
Let's say he shows up.

485
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,588
You gonna kiss this guy on both cheeks?

486
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,884
Take Paulie, OK?

487
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:40,765
You know perfectly well guys like him
never kick up their full per cent to you.

488
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:46,021
You look the other way,
price of doing business.

489
00:47:47,772 --> 00:47:52,360
But you cut Vito slack now
that he's "out of the closet",

490
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,364
just the excuse people need
to go off the reservation

491
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,326
and start withholding serious money.

492
00:48:02,704 --> 00:48:05,498
Let me read in peace, will you?

493
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:12,505
- Having fun with all this paper?
- I can't believe this is just one case.

494
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:16,092
Rafaella Martino.
I'm the lead attorney on this mess.

495
00:48:16,134 --> 00:48:19,512
- Meadow Soprano.
- I'm Michael Kardish. I work with Rae.

496
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:24,893
You came highly recommended. Columbia
Dean's List, volunteer at the Law Center.

497
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:30,190
This is really interesting, too. It's different than
the kind of thing we see at the Law Center.

498
00:48:30,231 --> 00:48:34,110
- Clients there are so trampled and...
- Welcome to white-collar fraud.

499
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:37,322
I need the e-mails from box 44 and 45,
July and August.

500
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:41,493
- Pull them and leave them with my assistant.
- OK.

501
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:45,330
Tony Soprano's kid.

502
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,011
Building my lats back up.

503
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:03,973
Did you talk to the building inspector
about my house?

504
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:06,267
Shit, I forgot.

505
00:49:19,614 --> 00:49:24,077
The sorting's tedious, but some of the cases...
This guy was pretty clever, really.

506
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,374
He set up all these phoney investment firms,
then just siphoned the money out. $80 million.

507
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,127
Yeah, and he's out on bail.

508
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:38,633
Look at my father's friend, federal marshals
dragging him out of his daughter's wedding.

509
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,846
He hasn't even been tried yet.
You're innocent here until proven guilty.

510
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:46,349
Yeah, but Johnny Macaroni
was indicted for murder.

511
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:49,310
They couldn't let him stay 15 more minutes?

512
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:52,856
You'd better put your pants on.

513
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:59,779
You know why they did that.
To humiliate him in front of everyone.

514
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:04,200
Metal detectors, frisking,
my father with the shoes.

515
00:50:04,242 --> 00:50:08,538
- It was pure harassment.
- The guy's lucky they even let him out.

516
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,543
So white-collar criminals can destroy
people's lives and steal their pensions

517
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,587
and it's no big deal to you.

518
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:17,922
You know what? Bad subject.

519
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:22,844
- Let's talk about something else.
- No, let's talk about it.

520
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:28,099
So we can stop with the macaroni cracks.
Weird, since you're part Italian yourself.

521
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:31,102
- My dad is so deracinated...
- The way he prefers it.

522
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:35,357
All those hysterical jokes
about Italian cheeses and smelly feet.

523
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:41,154
- Why are you picking a fight?
- You're slamming my family. I don't know.

524
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:46,284
This is good shit.

525
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:48,119
Amazing.

526
00:50:51,956 --> 00:50:55,710
You weren't there
for the "grand inquisition" about Vito.

527
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,171
I knew it. I'm picking the fight.

528
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:02,842
I was in the back of a butcher shop
with your Uncle Paulie,

529
00:51:02,884 --> 00:51:06,179
ratting out a guy I don't really even know.

530
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:10,600
I mean, what do you think's going
to happen to Vito for being gay?

531
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:15,605
Don't give me any of that
"poverty of the Mezzogiorno" bullshit.

532
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:21,444
We're in fucking Caldwell, New Jersey,
and you're on your high horse about justice?

533
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:24,406
They are gonna mete it out themselves.

534
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:28,785
This is untenable.

535
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:31,056
This is nice, this pot.

536
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:35,477
Yeah, that's a Baneda.
Arts and Crafts Movement.

537
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:40,440
Yeah? I really don't know much about this stuff.

538
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:45,070
Well, you've got a good eye.
That's the most expensive piece in the store.

539
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,365
You're a natural.
