1
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,030
When I was a child
I had a fever

2
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:09,831
My hands felt like just
two balloons

3
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,768
What are you doing up
so early?

4
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:24,471
I couldn't sleep.

5
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:33,914
- You want breakfast?
- Yeah, all right.

6
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:35,783
- Anthony.
- What?

7
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:37,518
I am making
french toast.

8
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:41,222
I'm not hungry. Jesus, how
many times you gonna ask me?

9
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,959
You've heard the term comfort food.
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

10
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,595
I know this is hard
for you to believe,

11
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,030
but food may not be
the answer to every problem.

12
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,967
- Neither is acting like a whiny little bitch.
- Tony.

13
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,536
I'll eat at work,
okay?

14
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,538
My shitty-ass
pizza job.

15
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,373
If it's so horrible,
take a day off.

16
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:04,044
My fiancee left me.

17
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:06,046
That job is all I have
in my life.

18
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:09,450
It's better to have loved
and lost, AJ.

19
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:12,486
- What?
- It is.

20
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,666
I feel bad for him,
but what the fuck?

21
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,134
Why's he gotta
take it out on us?

22
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:34,275
I'm looking
for a miter saw.

23
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:37,912
I got the Makita, carbide
blade, laser guide.

24
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:41,448
- Lists for $600... $200.
- Sold.

25
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,417
- Mike, you got that? The Makita.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,786
Cheese it.
It's the off-duty cops.

27
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:49,156
- You know my son-in-law Chris,
the movie producer? - How you doing?

28
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:51,358
- Let me know about that ticket.
- It's squashed, forget it.

29
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,695
Thanks. How you doing?
How's my little girl?

30
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:57,765
- Good. You coming Sunday, right?
- Yeah. 2:00, she said.

31
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:01,702
For you. Tell your friend Paulie
to keep these power tools coming.

32
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,876
Madonn', those fucking belt
sanders flying off the shelves, huh?

33
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,878
You ain't seen this
many cops lined up

34
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:13,147
since the centennial
of Dunkin' Donuts.

35
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,815
They're all handymen.

36
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:18,118
They got side jobs so they can
afford those 18-foot bass boats.

37
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:21,455
Cataldo, that state trooper, he's
putting a drop ceiling in my basement.

38
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,757
Thanks, sweetie.

39
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:27,528
12k in there.
I took my cut.

40
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,530
I'm seeing Al again
next week.

41
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,200
- To business.
- You're gonna jinx me? Toast with water?

42
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,009
When I was using,
I was a disgrace.

43
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:44,478
Now I'm sober, and I'm a drip.
The fuck you want from me?

44
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:46,947
How's about being normal?
That so fucking hard?

45
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:49,450
Actually, yeah, Paulie,
for some of us it is.

46
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:52,820
Don't get cunty.
I'm breaking your balls.

47
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,759
What do you say
we take a ride?

48
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,428
Little prime rib?
On me.

49
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:06,200
- Maybe next time.
- What are you, watching your cholesterol now, too?

50
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:09,537
Yeah, you're fucking
hilarious.

51
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,190
Hey, Tony.
What's the good word?

52
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:32,259
- Can't complain.
- Sure you could. Phil Leotardo.

53
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,665
My first assignment out of
the academy was in Brooklyn.

54
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:39,700
Never cared for him.

55
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:43,037
He tried to set up this other
rookie, female, for rape and beating.

56
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,577
Listen, that subject
we talked about...

57
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,446
If I was
to know something

58
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,982
possibly terror-related

59
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,450
and help you out,

60
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,286
could I bank the
resulting goodwill?

61
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:01,822
Well...

62
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:04,091
What happens is

63
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,627
I would personally write you
what's called a 5k letter.

64
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,197
It's a document setting forth
your cooperation and service.

65
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,199
Is letter would be
placed in your file

66
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,002
and if you were ever
convicted of a crime...

67
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,273
It'd be presented
to a judge when he or she

68
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:22,676
would be considering
sentencing guidelines.

69
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,984
Well, there were
a couple of guys,

70
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,853
I don't know, arabs,
arabians maybe.

71
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,322
They used to hang around
the Bing,

72
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,491
and somebody I knew

73
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,261
may have did some
business with them.

74
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:43,130
At the port?

75
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:47,768
- You were saying.
- The point is they used to be around all the time,

76
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,870
these two,
you know, drinking

77
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,106
and trying to tit-fuck
the girls, whatever.

78
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,008
And then suddenly,
they disappeared,

79
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:56,544
and I mean completely.

80
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,946
And then a week or so ago
I'm driving, and I see 'em

81
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:02,550
with these other guys,

82
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,051
they had the headgear
and the beard

83
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,787
and the whole
fundamental bit.

84
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,958
But there's nothing
illegal there, right?

85
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,527
What were they doing?

86
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,963
Walking.

87
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,799
But then they meet up
with this other group.

88
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,868
I don't know.
It seemed...

89
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,471
You got a name?

90
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,306
One was Ahmad

91
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:27,975
or Jamali...

92
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:33,314
Hold on, hold on.

93
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,324
Hey, T.

94
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,326
Yeah, I'm here
with some people,

95
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:47,661
and, uh... The arabs from the
Bing. What were their names?

96
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,097
- Some people?
- Exactly.

97
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,935
Oh, fuck, yeah,
Ahmed and Mohammed.

98
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:58,405
- What did they do?
- Ahmed and Mohammed.

99
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:00,674
You know, actually,
I got a cell number.

100
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:04,011
I called him recently, but
he don't answer no more.

101
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:07,515
Ahmed Al Najafi.

102
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,286
973-555-0146.

103
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,522
Ahmed Al Najafi.

104
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,060
Tell me they're not gonna blow up
the chemical plant or some shit.

105
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:23,230
I don't know.
I'll call you later.

106
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,536
- Cell phone.
- That's a real prize.

107
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:29,870
Thank you.

108
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,642
So finally I said,
"okay, you know,

109
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:36,644
as long as you don't
mind yesterday's pizza.

110
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,779
"No, no", he said,
"It's cool.

111
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,348
"So great," I told him.
"Come back tomorrow."

112
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,984
You are so bad.

113
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:46,453
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

114
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,554
- I'll add you overtime?
- Yeah, thank you.

115
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,994
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Some guy.

116
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,930
What are you,
going out with him?

117
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:58,766
He smiled, Anthony.
He works here.

118
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,802
- You gotta stop.
- Or what?

119
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:03,504
Or I won't
see you again.

120
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,639
Oh, like meeting me for
coffee is such a big deal.

121
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:08,008
Honestly, I don't even think
it's a good idea anyway.

122
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,510
How come?

123
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:13,414
'Cause last time you started crying
and had to leave the Starbucks.

124
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,121
I can't sleep at night
without you.

125
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:24,225
It'll get better, okay?

126
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,595
I love you so much.

127
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,697
I gotta go back
to work.

128
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:33,267
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

129
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:46,947
You knock off early,
we go back to your place,

130
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,350
christen those new sheets
you were telling me about.

131
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,352
A man with a plan,
huh?

132
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:54,455
The man with the erection.

133
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,695
Let me take this.

134
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,430
Hey.

135
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:07,234
It's me. I need you to come home. It's AJ.

136
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,403
- What happened?
- I am worried, Tony.

137
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,372
I have never seen him
like this.

138
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:14,575
I'm supposed to meet the
realtor to see a new property,

139
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,378
- but I am afraid to leave him alone.
- Afraid, why?

140
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,646
Will you just
come home, please?

141
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,922
Go away.

142
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,658
It's me.

143
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,662
What's the matter?

144
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,336
- What happened?
- You know what happened.

145
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,904
Blanca still.

146
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:48,709
All right, that's it.
Enough's enough.

147
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,278
Look, I'm fucking
depressed, okay?

148
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,181
You broke up. How long
you want to cry about it?

149
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:56,183
She was my life.

150
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:58,486
You're 20 years old.
You barely have a life,

151
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,488
and you're better off
anyway.

152
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:04,091
She was cute, okay, but come on.
With another guy's kid to boot.

153
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:06,694
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

154
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,272
What you're going through,

155
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:20,641
what you're feeling
right now...

156
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,144
It happens sometimes.

157
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:26,580
Everybody gets the blues.

158
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,783
There's a half-a-billion-dollar
industry devoted to it.

159
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,285
What, Prozac?

160
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,455
No, the music business.

161
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:37,324
They write thousands
of songs about this shit.

162
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,093
"Tears on my pillow,"

163
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,762
"Mona Lisa," right?

164
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,602
Listen,
these fucking women,

165
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:52,106
they'll drive you nuts with
your emotions and whatnot.

166
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,943
And I know it feels like you're
never gonna love anybody again.

167
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,846
But trust me, there's
millions of girls out there

168
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,648
that are dying
to meet a guy like you.

169
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:04,418
- I see 'em every day.
- Oh, right, I'm so special.

170
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,755
You're damn right you are.
You're handsome and smart

171
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,456
and a hard worker,

172
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:12,593
and let's be honest...
white.

173
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,095
That's a huge plus
nowadays.

174
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,699
Go out
and get a blowjob.

175
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,635
I don't want a blowjob.

176
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:23,037
Keep your voice down.

177
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,439
Why?

178
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:27,675
- Who's listening out there?
- Nobody.

179
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,478
Oh, fuck me!

180
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,713
You saw her again,
didn't you?

181
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:36,050
I knew it.

182
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:37,718
I don't wanna talk
about it.

183
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:41,388
I love you, Anthony. It's
killing me to see you like this.

184
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:44,291
What's the fucking point?

185
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,864
- Point of what?
- Just leave me alone.

186
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,982
Honestly, I was glad
when they broke up.

187
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,751
The culture divide...
But now...

188
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,753
Everything turns to shit.

189
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:19,927
Hi.

190
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,429
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- Sure.

191
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,431
I'm so nervous cooking
for all these people.

192
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,601
- Dad, do you remember Tony's sister Barbara?
- Of course.

193
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:30,004
- Hi, nice to see you.
- Her husband Tom, Stefan, Alyssa.

194
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:31,539
- Hi, this is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

195
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,440
And the baby.

196
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,176
Oh, come in.
Come in.

197
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:38,546
- Oh, look at that baby.
- Smile for grandma.

198
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:42,449
- Can I play the Xbox?
- What happened to folding the napkins?

199
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,856
- How you holding up?
- I'm totally freaking.

200
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:52,026
I gotta take
the ziti out.

201
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,241
You okay, T?

202
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:10,611
- You having a good time?
- Yeah.

203
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,814
So it could be good. Got
a lot of money in this.

204
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,586
Oh, look at that
wrist action.

205
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,721
All those years
yanking it

206
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:23,624
finally starting
to pay off.

207
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:26,026
That non-alcoholic shit
any good?

208
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,263
It's all right.

209
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,403
Less filling,
tastes like ass.

210
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,409
This is nice.

211
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,411
About time you invited
everybody over.

212
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,347
It was Kelli's idea.

213
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:48,616
She's been wanting to get her
teeth wet with the entertaining.

214
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,751
Good thing,
else I'd never see you.

215
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,486
What are you
talking about?

216
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,922
- Steak's done.
- You think so?

217
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,158
It keeps cooking even
if it's off the flame.

218
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,927
The juices.

219
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,099
So what's up
with you?

220
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,467
You've been
like a ghost lately.

221
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,435
You're around one second,
next thing you're gone.

222
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,038
- I was by the Bing the other day.
- For, like, five minutes.

223
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:14,275
You know, you of all people
should understand how hard it is

224
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,277
for me to be
around that place.

225
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:19,146
- I should? Why?
- 'Cause you're in therapy.

226
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,483
You understand the human
condition, at least.

227
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,487
Still doing that?

228
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:28,856
Turn those ribs.

229
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,625
Truth is, between the booze
and the strippers over there,

230
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,627
half of them
are fucking cokeheads.

231
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,663
It's hard, you know?

232
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:38,632
And Satriale's,
that fridge full of beer.

233
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,568
You know how tough it is
to eat a sausage and peppers

234
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,902
without a cold one?

235
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,405
So then just quit. You
want a beer, too bad.

236
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:46,474
- Show some balls.
- I got balls.

237
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,576
I can't eat eggplant no
more 'cause of my stomach.

238
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,644
Might put me
into a relapse.

239
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:53,414
Now believe me,
I'd like to, but I don't.

240
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,716
It's not that simple.

241
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,952
- Well, make it simple.
- It's a disease.

242
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,688
I inherited it. You know
the problem with my mother.

243
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,193
I gotta be honest.
This whole disease concept,

244
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,895
I think it's bullshit.

245
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,097
So you know more than
the leading scientists now?

246
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,666
- I know a crutch when I see it.
- So my dad?

247
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,035
You obviously must have
knew he had a crutch.

248
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:19,039
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Come on, Ton', huh?

249
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,941
Between the coke,
the vodka,

250
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,410
whatever the fuck else he
was squirting up his arm...

251
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,180
Let's be honest about the
great Dickie Moltisanti:

252
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:29,283
my dad, your hero,

253
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:32,185
wasn't much more
than a fucking junkie.

254
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:50,104
- Hey, don't fucking move!
- Whoa, whoa, Al, whoa, whoa.

255
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,706
- Easy easy.
- What the fuck is going on?

256
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,376
Paulie, remember?
Germani.

257
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,378
We met at your
granddaughter's christening.

258
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,946
The fuck
are you doing?

259
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,215
- My uncle didn't call you?
- No...

260
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,918
- Who's your uncle?
- Paulie Gaultieri.

261
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:07,288
- These are for his friend down at the union.
- What union?

262
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,157
He was supposed to call you.
You fucking believe this?

263
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,465
Al, this is a big
fucking mix-up.

264
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:20,567
I thought Paulie
called you.

265
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,636
- The guy's waiting.
- So you break in?

266
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,772
I got a silent alarm that
goes right to my house.

267
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,040
He'll take care
of you. Don't worry.

268
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,208
Let me talk
to my son-in-law.

269
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,177
Chris? Fine by me,

270
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:34,014
but if I were you, I wouldn't make
a problem where there ain't one.

271
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:58,005
- Take over, okay, Felix?
- What you do?

272
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,840
- I'm leaving.
- Who?

273
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,109
I'm going home,
all right? I quit.

274
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,111
Why you do that?

275
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:06,280
If Dale calls,
just tell him I'm sorry.

276
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,149
But you're the manager.

277
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,954
- Ton', hey.
- Hey.

278
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:17,024
- How you doing?
- This always helps.

279
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:20,594
Ooh!
God bless the NFL.

280
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:23,797
I tell ya, I owe a spot of it to my son.

281
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:27,034
I was against this kid
even going to college.

282
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:30,137
But once him and Carlo's kid
started taking action on campus,

283
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:33,474
far as I'm concerned, he
should stay till he gets a Phd.

284
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:35,409
Benefits of a higher
education.

285
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,978
Don't get me wrong.
He's learning stuff, too.

286
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,381
The shit this kid knows
about computers...

287
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:42,383
He set his mother up
with a whole web site

288
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,818
for her
ceramics business.

289
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:46,186
You must be
very proud.

290
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,323
Believe me, I thank God every day.

291
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:53,160
I gotta take a leak.

292
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:05,706
Oh, Parisi the younger. I was just
talking to your dad about you.

293
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,176
- What did I do now?
- To hear him tell it, u're the golden boy.

294
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,215
- Hey, ton'.
- What the fuck's with you?

295
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,284
Root canal.
They got me on Oxycodone.

296
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,286
My whole fucking head
is numb.

297
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:21,055
Well, that answers
a loof questions.

298
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,391
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

299
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,230
I'll see you inside, Ton'.
I got something for you.

300
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,339
- So how's Rutgers?
- You see those envelopes?

301
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:41,942
Majoring in cash,
Minoring in ass.

302
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,745
Things change,uh?

303
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,715
When I was in college, it wasn't
so much with the sports betting.

304
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,251
- Hey, how's AJ doing?
- Good good.

305
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:53,254
He's working. Broke up
with that girlfriend of his.

306
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:56,257
That spanish chick? He took her
to my cousin Angela's wedding.

307
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,725
She was smoking,
that girl.

308
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,793
Yeah yeah,
you know, whatever.

309
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:01,662
He didn't want
to get too serious.

310
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:03,397
Fuck, Jay,
check it out.

311
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:10,137
Holy shit.

312
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,609
So Sil tells me

313
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:17,311
you booked a party
here next week.

314
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:19,980
- Yeah, yeah, it's our frat.
- You should call AJ.

315
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,650
He's probably busy, but I
know he'd love to see you guys.

316
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,618
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.
- Definitely, absolutely.

317
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:32,426
- Who is it?
- Me.

318
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,868
- How you doing, kid?
- What the fuck, Paulie?

319
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:43,103
I left you
four messages.

320
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:44,939
My flight was delayed.
I just got home.

321
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,174
And I've been dealing
with Al for two days.

322
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,276
Just tell him to relax.

323
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:52,713
They busted into his store.
His acid reflux is acting up.

324
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,149
He woke up Kelli,
got her all upset.

325
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,318
It's my fault your
father-in-law's a crybaby?

326
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:58,752
They told him
I'd take care of him.

327
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,422
- What's his problem?
- I'm stupid now?

328
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:04,692
You know and I know they
were there to boost that shit.

329
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,460
It couldn't wait, okay?
I pormised a load

330
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:08,162
to lenny down
the joint-fitters union.

331
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:09,964
What do I give a fuck?
It ain't my union.

332
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,499
Lower your voice.
I got neighbors.

333
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:13,400
Fuck your neighbors.
When you gonna pay me?

334
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,871
When you suck the money out of
my ass! Now get the fuck out!

335
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:28,415
Add three more M.R.I.s and
you're looking at a 10% increase

336
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,317
- Across the board.
- Listen, I gotta talk to you.

337
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:33,521
- Now?
- It can't wait, T. This fucking paulie!

338
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,689
What happened?

339
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:41,996
He sent his idiot nephew and jason
molinaro to my father-in-law's store.

340
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:43,898
They boosted a pallet
of power saws.

341
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,900
- They did?
- Yeah.

342
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,235
Not exactly. Al caught
'em while they were there.

343
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:51,271
So they did or they
did not take the saws?

344
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:54,275
They did
under false pretense.

345
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,533
And this is what you couldn't
wait to talk to me about?

346
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,913
They broke into
the guy's store, T!

347
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,048
Yeah, I hear you.
I get it.

348
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,050
But we're in the middle
of talking about an ongoing,

349
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:06,387
potentially multimillion
- dollar proposition here, Christopher.

350
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,788
It ain't the money,
Ton'.

351
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:11,192
Oh, really? Well, I'm
glad you feel that way.

352
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:14,528
A pallet of drills.
You believe this shit?

353
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:18,165
Go have a lime rickey or whatever the
fuck it is you're drinking these days,

354
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,900
and we'll be done
in a few minutes.

355
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,471
Forget it, all right?
I got other shit to do.

356
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,809
Come in.

357
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,178
I need to talk
to you guys.

358
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,981
What's the matter?
Finn?

359
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:36,550
What? No.

360
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:38,919
It's not about me.
AJ.

361
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:42,256
- What about him?
- I know he's upset,

362
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:45,626
but he's been saying some things
that are really disturbing.

363
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:48,963
- Like what?
- Like nobody gives a shit about him.

364
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:52,500
What's the point
of anything? Stuff like that.

365
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,836
I told you about that girl
hadley in my dorm sophomore year,

366
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:59,173
the one who threw herself
off the library balcony.

367
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,742
These are the exact kind
of things she was saying.

368
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:06,280
I don't mean
to get you all upset...

369
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:08,816
Of course not. I'm
glad you said something.

370
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:11,485
Good night.

371
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,522
- Good night, sweetie.
-  Get some sleep.

372
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,906
I'm just a guy looking
to punch you in the mouth.

373
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:34,508
Oh, you can
take a punch.

374
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,110
I guess we knew that
already, didn't we?

375
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:42,283
You can actually land
a punch, too.

376
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,457
- You're pretty good...
-  Thanks.

377
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,459
...against a 36-year-old
out-of-shape lieutenant.

378
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,647
I came here today
to tell you

379
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,317
in all seriousness
that I'm done.

380
00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:19,854
I did what you said.

381
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,889
I gave it a lot
of thought,

382
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,725
and I decided that
once and for all,

383
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,228
it's over.

384
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:30,764
The truth is

385
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:34,034
this therapy is a jerk-off.

386
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:36,270
You know it,
and I know it.

387
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,206
I actually don't know it,

388
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:42,042
but please continue.

389
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:44,912
- It's a jerk-off.
- Yes, you've said that.

390
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:51,175
Anyway, I was coming here
to quit.

391
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:54,855
Had it all planned out.
But guess what.

392
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:00,227
My son is
talking suicide.

393
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:02,229
So now I'm trapped
here forever.

394
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:04,431
My god,
what did he say?

395
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,967
His girlfriend,
fiancee, whatever...

396
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,602
She broke up with him.

397
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,905
He's beyond devastated.

398
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,808
Would you like me to recommend
someone for him to talk to?

399
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:17,711
Carmela's getting a referral
from his own pediatrician.

400
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:18,612
Oh.

401
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:21,081
After that incompetent you sent Meadow to?

402
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:31,325
So I suppose now comes the
inherent fucking grilling

403
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,162
- about how I feel about all this.
- Isn't that why you're here?

404
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:41,569
Friends of mine,
they got sons his age,

405
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,105
and they're happy,

406
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:48,108
ambitious.

407
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,211
They fucking take life
as it comes.

408
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:52,846
I know it seems
that way,

409
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:55,916
but do you really know
these other boys?

410
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,853
I know what I see, my
son curled up on the couch

411
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:01,689
in a fetus position when he
should be out banging coeds.

412
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:04,692
- Have you talked to him?
- Till I'm blue in the face.

413
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:07,094
We both have, and now
we're afraid to talk to him

414
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:10,931
because of what
he might do.

415
00:26:14,602 --> 00:26:18,139
Obviously,
I'm prone to depression...

416
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,008
A certain bleak attitude

417
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:23,310
about the world,

418
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:26,480
but I know
I can handle it.

419
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:28,616
Your kids, though...

420
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,523
It's like
when they're little,

421
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,225
and they get sick,

422
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:44,031
you'd give anything in the
world to trade places with them,

423
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,300
so they don't
have to suffer.

424
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,538
And then to think
you're the cause of it.

425
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:52,473
How are you
the cause of it?

426
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:56,510
It's in his blood, this
miserable fucking existence.

427
00:26:57,912 --> 00:27:00,481
My rotten fucking
putrid genes

428
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,983
have infected
kid's soul.

429
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,152
That's my gift
to my son.

430
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:20,835
I know this
is difficult.

431
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,906
But I'm very glad
we're having this discussion.

432
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,008
Really, really?

433
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,344
'Cause I gotta be honest.
I think it fucking sucks.

434
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,913
- What does?
- Therapy, this.

435
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:34,915
I hate this fucking shit!

436
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,889
Seriously, we're both
adults here, right?

437
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:45,759
So after all is said

438
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,194
and done,

439
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:49,230
after all the complaining
and the crying

440
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:52,433
and all the
fucking bullshit,

441
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,036
is this all there is?

442
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,276
Yes, welcome.

443
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,945
Hi, I'm Chris. I'm an
alcoholic and drug addict.

444
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,514
Hi, chris.

445
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:09,349
I want to go back
to what Stan said...

446
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,051
How not being able
to socialize

447
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:13,454
is hard
when you're a salesman.

448
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,489
In my case,
it's the same thing.

449
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,492
It's actually taking food
out of my daughter mouth.

450
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:22,163
My boss, for all his
bullshit encouragement,

451
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:24,165
how he respects
what I'm doing,

452
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:26,834
the reality is
he resents my sobriety.

453
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,569
I had the same thing
at Unicor.

454
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,571
They were all onboard
for the intervention,

455
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:33,774
but skip one golf outing,
and you're ostracized.

456
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,510
He's an enabler, too, this
guy, the worst fucking kind.

457
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,579
Pours you a drink
with one hand,

458
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,848
judges you with the other
if you take it.

459
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:42,917
And he wonders why I'm distant...
At least he says he does...

460
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:45,219
Why I wanna branch out
into other things.

461
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,721
But I can promise you I'd
have more money in my pocket,

462
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:50,991
plus more responsibility
if I sat with him drinking,

463
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:53,027
watching that scotch
drool out

464
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:55,830
of his fat
fucking mouth.

465
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,604
...embedded that dream
into our culture...

466
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,475
Hey.

467
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,318
What are you watching?

468
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:19,386
Nothing.

469
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,356
Oh, whoa,
that's a good one.

470
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:23,491
John Wayne.

471
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,401
Two Jasons call you?

472
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,370
Invite you to a party
tomorrow night?

473
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:38,839
I don't know.

474
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:41,041
Well, either they did
or they didn't.

475
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:44,545
Yeah, I guess.
Jason Gervasi called.

476
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,982
What'd you tell him?

477
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,583
I didn't
call him back.

478
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,985
How come?

479
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:53,554
'Cause I don't
want to go.

480
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:58,225
Of course not.
Beer, strippers,

481
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,928
fuckin' around with guys
your own age...

482
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:03,164
You hate all that shit.

483
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,201
You gonna call him?

484
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,936
Said I don't
want to go.

485
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:13,541
I know you don't
want to go.

486
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,010
You don't want to work,
you don't want to eat,

487
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,745
you don't want to talk either.

488
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:19,346
So, all that
being the case,

489
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:21,348
you're gonna shower tomorrow
night, you're gonna shave,

490
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,351
you're gonna get dress,
you're gonna go to that party.

491
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,391
I'm not gonna
debate you on this.

492
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:38,199
Fine.

493
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,607
...just how soon before they
attempt to blow this fire out?

494
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,310
They won't try to kill it till
they're ready to cap the well.

495
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:53,047
- Your boss is your uncle.
- Once removed.

496
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:56,650
That's gotta add
to the source.

497
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,121
We used to be so tight.

498
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:04,725
And producing movies
is high-stress enough.

499
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:09,396
I have a happy marriage.

500
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:13,267
But there was a woman...

501
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:19,507
She worked with us
in a club we had.

502
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:23,244
Anyway, she became
a problem to deal with,

503
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,413
and...

504
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,616
I sided with him.

505
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,684
She was out
of my life.

506
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,357
Okay, fine.

507
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,727
But he never
appreciated it.

508
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:43,497
Give give give,
it's all I ever do.

509
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,768
I think that's when the relationship
between me and him got poisoned.

510
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:11,859
How's it going?

511
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,327
Al here?

512
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,162
You just missed him.
He went to lunch.

513
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,697
- Eh.
- Can I help you fellas?

514
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,165
We're here
for the drills.

515
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:19,700
What drills?

516
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,235
You know,
in the back.

517
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:29,243
I know what you mean, but Al didn't
say nothing about picking anything up.

518
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,811
This fuckin' guy.

519
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,480
Get him on the phone.

520
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,714
All right.

521
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:35,049
What's your name?

522
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:37,017
Me? I'm Mike.

523
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,252
Paulie.

524
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:40,421
Nice to meet.

525
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,755
Voice mail.

526
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,524
Gimme that.

527
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,693
Yeah, Al,
it's paulie.

528
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,595
Listen, we're here
with mike.

529
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:51,065
We're gonna take the drills. I'll
call you later about that other order.

530
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,001
Huh?

531
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:11,117
What's her name?

532
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,721
Blanca.

533
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:17,057
Had you and Blanca
been engaged long?

534
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,061
Only a couple
of weeks.

535
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:23,063
She had a son too,

536
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,932
from when she used
to be married.

537
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:27,234
What do you think
went wrong?

538
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:30,204
Her husband was
an asshole, supposedly.

539
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,772
With your relationship?

540
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,474
Oh.

541
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,811
I don't know.

542
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:38,913
I mean, I wish there
was a reason, but...

543
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,548
She says there isn't.

544
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:47,621
I think maybe it's because
we have way more money

545
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:49,256
in my family than hers.

546
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,991
They're immigrants,

547
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:52,893
and that might
have scared her.

548
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,871
Have you been feeling
suicidal, Anthony?

549
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:11,579
A little bit.

550
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:14,581
Have you ever tried
to kill yourself?

551
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:17,084
No.

552
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:19,987
I mean, once,
me and my friends

553
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,755
jumped off my
garage roof,

554
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:24,358
but you know, that was
just to fool around.

555
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,768
You sleeping a lot?

556
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,172
I'm tired,

557
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,773
but I keep waking up.

558
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:41,475
Nightmares?

559
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,612
I just keep thinking
about her.

560
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,815
I mean,
it hurts, but...

561
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,550
I can't help it.

562
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,186
Does anything in life
give you pleasure lately?

563
00:34:53,754 --> 00:34:55,523
I don't know.

564
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:56,857
Not really.

565
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:59,994
There's a medication
called Lexapro.

566
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,428
It's an antidepressant.

567
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:03,164
I have friends
who take that.

568
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:05,833
Well, I'm going to
write you a prescription.

569
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:11,105
I'm making mad
fuckin' money, bro.

570
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:13,340
I gotta shut
my phone off sometimes.

571
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,109
You should totally
do it, man.

572
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:18,212
I'm not really good with
betting and percentages.

573
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:20,481
I got like a 450
on my math SAT.

574
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:23,484
Fuck that shit, bro. I could
hook you up in like 10 minutes.

575
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,489
Can I dance
for you, baby?

576
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,658
I guess.

577
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,531
Yeah, dude!
Yeah!

578
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:40,201
Yeah!

579
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:55,683
Look at this pile
of shit.

580
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:57,751
Yeah, so get some
toilet paper.

581
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:59,386
What is that,
comedy?

582
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,688
Actually, yeah.

583
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,223
Come on,
what are you gonna do?

584
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:05,092
Fuck it,
I'm all in.

585
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:06,727
Fuckin' idiot.
Toilet paper?

586
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:08,229
Fuckin' cunt!

587
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:10,264
- Fuck!
- Ho, chris!

588
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:12,366
You were my friend.

589
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:18,038
Whoa! No!

590
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,312
Oh, fuck!

591
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:27,548
Call an ambulance!

592
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,657
Tony, wake up.
I need to talk to you.

593
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,995
What?

594
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:45,399
You let our underage son go
to a party at a strip club?

595
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:49,403
What time is it?

596
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:58,579
Take it easy, will you?
What's the big deal?

597
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,281
He just got in
three hours ago.

598
00:37:00,414 --> 00:37:04,051
He is still drunk and
he's not even drinking age!

599
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:05,586
Yet he could die
in iraq.

600
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,488
What does that
ha to do with anything?

601
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:10,925
Jesus Christ, Carm, he's
gonna be 21 in two months.

602
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,160
He's an emotional
wreck, tony.

603
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,697
So, seeing a pair of tits is
gonna send him over the edge?

604
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:19,133
Got him out of the house,
around people his own age.

605
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,601
At the fuckin' Bing?

606
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,870
Well, they're college kids.
It's what they do.

607
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,639
I know you'd rather see him
in his room drinkin' cocoa,

608
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:28,409
but this is
the way back,

609
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:31,011
believe me... And the
way back to college...

610
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:35,649
Fraternities,
frat boys.

611
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:46,494
Hey.

612
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,403
I did a stupid thing, Ton'.
I won't deny it.

613
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,205
Stupid? Just
hung up with Paulie.

614
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,674
His nephew's got
six broken vertebraes.

615
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:09,750
I know that,
and I'm sorry.

616
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:12,219
But this is the second
fuckin' time

617
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,822
Paulie flouted his
authority to my face.

618
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:18,692
This shit with the tools...  I know he
set up the deal with the cubans,

619
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:21,962
but this is my father-in-law we're
talkin' about, tony, my family.

620
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:25,032
In any case, this bullshit could
have been handled with a conversation.

621
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:40,714
I came to the Bing, remember?
I tried to talk to you about it.

622
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:44,349
And I told you to wait, and you left
to go God-knows-where.

623
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,654
I got to be honest,
Christopher,

624
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:49,056
I can't help thinkin' that this goes
directly to what we talked about...

625
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:50,524
More than once.

626
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,060
If you were around more, you
had your finger on the pulse,

627
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:55,529
problems like this would
be squashed in the womb.

628
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:57,898
Whether I'm around's
got nothing to do with it.

629
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:00,568
He needed the tools, he
could have left me a message.

630
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:09,610
We're supposed to leave
phone messages

631
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,612
about interstate
hijacking now?

632
00:39:11,712 --> 00:39:13,347
How about faxes?
Emails?

633
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,950
Make it even easier
for the cops.

634
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:18,118
This is a face-to-face
business, Christopher.

635
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,321
And yeah, I'm gonna talk to
paulie, 'cause believe me,

636
00:39:20,421 --> 00:39:22,089
there's a few things
that he needs to hear.

637
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:24,725
But in the meantime, you figure
out how much he owes for the tools,

638
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:27,228
and we're gonna deduct that
against what you're gonna owe

639
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,663
for little Paulie's
hospital bills.

640
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:47,448
- Yeah?
- He tore up my lawn, Ton'!

641
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:50,151
Drove his fuckin' car
right up on the grass.

642
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,319
- Who did?
- Fuckin' Paulie, who else?

643
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,622
40 grand
in landscaping.

644
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:56,957
Terrorized my wife
and daughter.

645
00:39:57,057 --> 00:39:58,826
Destroyed the bushes,
the grass,

646
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,928
and every fuckin'
flower she plant

647
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:04,098
- Just relax, okay?
- I am fuckin' relaxed.

648
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:05,766
I'm not gonna
do nothin'.

649
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,369
Because I love you, because
I'm committed to my work,

650
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:09,770
I ain't gonna do shit.

651
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,438
I'm gonna sit tight
and hold my tongue,

652
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,640
and not cause
no problems for you.

653
00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:37,097
No, bad was '99. Mets/Braves
national league championship.

654
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,599
My dad went apeshit, man.

655
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,634
He threw a fuckin' vase
right through the tv.

656
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:43,370
Ho, Victor. What are you
doing at a deek party, bro?

657
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:44,638
You settlin' up?

658
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:46,640
Come on, it's friday.
Bills are sunday.

659
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:49,143
What are we, fuckin' Citibank?
How long we gonna carry your ass?

660
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:50,811
Buffalo's a lock.

661
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:52,379
Give me a dime
at two and a half.

662
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,648
If not, my father's sending
my check this week anyway.

663
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,084
Fuck that. If not...
You see this guy right here?

664
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:58,452
Tony Soprano Jr.

665
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,488
Know what that means,
right?

666
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,324
Monday, bro.
One way or the other.

667
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:05,059
Don't be
a dick about it.

668
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:17,471
Is he still sleeping?

669
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:19,006
He's not home.

670
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,175
He stayed
with his friends.

671
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:23,611
He sounded good.
They were playing cards.

672
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:25,880
Well, it's been a week
almost, on the meds.

673
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,517
All I know, is it's a pleasure
not to have him laying around here

674
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,018
like a miserab'.

675
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,454
It's companies like Wal-Mart
we got to thank.

676
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:35,856
They're always fighting
against tightenin' imports.

677
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:38,025
So, our provolone,
our perfume,

678
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,761
whooop! slides right
under the fuckin' door.

679
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:43,364
All those inspections slow
down wal-mart's operation.

680
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,599
And what about terrorism...
Missiles and shit?

681
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,802
There he is...
The missing link.

682
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:49,436
Hey.

683
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,974
How you doin'?

684
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,309
Good.

685
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:57,678
I called Sal Vitro
like you said.

686
00:41:57,745 --> 00:42:00,147
He's coming by this week,
resod the lawn.

687
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:04,585
And I talked to paulie. We
worked out a payment schedule.

688
00:42:04,618 --> 00:42:05,786
He's here?

689
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,555
Yeah.

690
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,624
All right.

691
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:12,827
Let me say hello.

692
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:20,000
Hey.

693
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,602
How you doing, kid?

694
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,304
How's little Paulie?

695
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:24,939
He's fucked up.

696
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:26,941
He got your flowers,
though.

697
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,343
Good.

698
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,846
- Listen, Paulie...
- Forget it, okay?

699
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:34,448
Shit happens.
What are you gonna do?

700
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,616
There's no point
in ruminatin'.

701
00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:38,252
You're right.

702
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,488
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

703
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:47,962
Me too.

704
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:51,298
Do this again, sweetie.
And get him a club soda.

705
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:56,837
You know what?
Fuck it.

706
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:58,639
Whatever he's having.

707
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,516
Good times.

708
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:09,950
Salut.

709
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:20,661
- That's fuckin' rocket fuel.
- One more, one more.

710
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,129
- One more.
- Ah yeah...

711
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:23,864
- What's going on, baby?
- Are you nuts?

712
00:43:23,964 --> 00:43:26,867
When, now?
Who else is there?

713
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:28,636
Let's do it.

714
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:29,870
Deek!

715
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:32,606
Deek deek deek deek!

716
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:33,874
All right, yeah...
No, definitely.

717
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:35,709
In like 20 minutes.

718
00:43:35,843 --> 00:43:38,012
- Yeah!
- All right, bye.

719
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:40,881
Yo, Donna Amato, they're having a
party and guess who's over there?

720
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,485
- Victor.
- That welchin' little prick,

721
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,253
you fuckin' kidding me?

722
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:48,722
You wanna come?

723
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,058
Oh I don't know.
I'm just gonna hang here.

724
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:53,027
Oh come on!
It'll be fun!

725
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:00,367
11 more credits and I can
transfer to Syracuse.

726
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:02,603
Their business program
is awesome.

727
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,705
Hey, you made it.

728
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:06,440
Fuck.

729
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:10,711
Vic, where are you
goin', buddy?

730
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,247
I was just grabbing a beer.
What's up?

731
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,882
Listen, I'm getting
your money, okay?

732
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:16,083
- No, yeah.
- Cool, great.

733
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:18,919
Let's take a ride and
talk about it, all right?

734
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:20,888
Come on, guys,
stop.

735
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,356
What's going on?

736
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:24,024
Nothin', we're just
fuckin' around.

737
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:31,866
- Get in the fuckin' car!
- No!

738
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:34,068
Get in the fuckin' car!

739
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:45,779
Fuckin' deadbeat.

740
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,449
You know what happens when
you don't fuckin' pay?

741
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,719
Stop stop!

742
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:52,987
What, are you gonna cry?

743
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,222
What are we,
fuckin' assholes?

744
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:56,390
Come on, man.
Where's the shit?

745
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,892
Yo, help us hold him down,
come on.

746
00:44:57,992 --> 00:45:00,761
- Come on!
- Get off me!

747
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,997
- No!
- Quit kickin', bitch!

748
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:04,832
Get his shoes.

749
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:06,667
Hey, dude, you ever
take chemistry?

750
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:09,003
'Cause Dr. Parisi and me, we're
gonna do a little experiment.

751
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:11,739
We want to see what happens when
you mix sulfuric acid with toe jam.

752
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,742
Fuck no!
No! No!

753
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,812
Don't, don't,
don't do it, fuck!

754
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,013
That hurt?

755
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,016
- You little bitch.
- No!

756
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:29,089
I mean,
you have a kid,

757
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:31,158
and they look at you...

758
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:33,527
You look back.

759
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:36,864
And you're looking
at yourself, really.

760
00:45:38,432 --> 00:45:41,335
Or part of you,
plus another person...

761
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:42,703
That love.

762
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:46,340
I look at
her eyes, man,

763
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,209
and she looks up,

764
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:50,144
back at me...

765
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:53,180
How the fuck do I put
myself up for adoption?

766
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:57,384
- What?
- Nothing, go ahead.

767
00:45:57,518 --> 00:45:59,720
- She ain't adopted, Paulie.
- I'm kidding.

768
00:45:59,787 --> 00:46:02,122
What were you saying?

769
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:08,462
My point...
What the fuck was...

770
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:12,633
Is babies.
They're the future.

771
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:22,076
Do you realize by the time
Caitlin's out of college,

772
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:25,479
it'll be like,
the year 2027 or something?

773
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:28,215
She takes after you, she won't
be out of fourth grade by then.

774
00:46:30,317 --> 00:46:33,254
Look, by that time, she'll be
working here, so who gives a shit?

775
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,355
- Ho, what are you doing?
- Nothin'.

776
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:09,757
- Oh!
- Come on, come on.

777
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,525
- We're just fuckin' around.
- It's late.

778
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:13,460
I gotta go.

779
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,716
- Hello?
- It's me.

780
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:43,657
I'm fuckin'
losing it, man.

781
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,159
Chris,
it's 11-fuckin'-30.

782
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,894
Well, you're awake,
though, right?

783
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:48,629
I'm sorry.
You sleepin'?

784
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,065
I'm working. I'm on a
deadline for a "Law & Order."

785
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:53,634
Marianne's
left me alone.

786
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:55,236
How much did you drink?

787
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:57,671
I don't know.
A lot.

788
00:47:57,738 --> 00:48:00,741
I'm gonna make some coffee, and
then we're gonna call your sponsor.

789
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,576
He's gone. Eddie,
he's away someplace...

790
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:03,911
Philadelphia.

791
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:07,615
This fuckin'
Paulie, man.

792
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:09,650
You think he's your
friend, this cocksucker,

793
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,252
all these pricks...

794
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,755
What are you doing?

795
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:16,423
You're drunk.
I'm making coffee.

796
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:18,359
I don't want
fuckin' coffee.

797
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:22,429
It's an urban myth,
anyway.

798
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:30,004
- What do you write?
- "Law & Order."

799
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,276
I'll give you stories
make your fuckin' head curl...

800
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,845
The shit I seen.

801
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:39,847
Fuck that, the shit
I did personally.

802
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,515
I don't want
to hear it.

803
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:44,018
What you need to do is sober
up and get to a meeting.

804
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:45,619
That's your
fuckin' answer?

805
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:48,989
It is the answer.
Work the program.

806
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:50,791
You know,
you're a fuckin' robot.

807
00:48:50,858 --> 00:48:52,860
Anybody ever
tell you that?

808
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:55,996
You got any fuckin'
emotion in there?

809
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:58,966
I don't know about you,

810
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:01,035
but my friends
have abandoned me.

811
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:03,737
I've been totally
fuckin' ostrafied.

812
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:06,140
Because when
we drink and we use,

813
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,042
we are not pleasant
to be around.

814
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:12,313
My heart's fuckin' breaking
and you're blowing me off?

815
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:14,482
You know, my father
fuckin' abandoned me.

816
00:49:14,582 --> 00:49:17,585
I thought he was shot.

817
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,722
You have any idea,
if I wanted,

818
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:23,924
what I could do
to these pricks?

819
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:27,361
One phone call
and it's over.

820
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:29,663
The whole fuckin' castle
comes down...

821
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:31,098
Whoa whoa whoa!

822
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:33,367
Do you remember
my girlfriend, Adriana...

823
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:34,835
My fiancee?

824
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:37,171
My friend,
ralph cifaretto?

825
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:40,074
- I know shit, my friend.
- Chris, come on!

826
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:41,875
Serious fuckin'
things,

827
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:43,676
that would have
major implications

828
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,012
on a lot of
fuckin' people...

829
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:46,413
Chris, I shouldn't
hear this shit.

830
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:47,781
I know, right.
You said.

831
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:50,518
You just want to write
about it, leech off me.

832
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,786
I'm trying
to help you, man.

833
00:49:55,189 --> 00:49:57,291
That fuckin' program...

834
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,027
The government has
got money to burn.

835
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,196
Gravano was livin' large
down in arizona,

836
00:50:02,363 --> 00:50:03,864
all on that federal tit.

837
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:06,033
- All right, let's get you home.
- I like the sun,

838
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,135
be closer to
hollywood anyway.

839
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:09,637
Give me your phone.
I'm calling your wife.

840
00:50:09,737 --> 00:50:11,872
- What?
- I have told you

841
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:14,608
repeatedly, I do not
want to hear this shit.

842
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:17,177
I let you be part
of my movie.

843
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:19,547
You let me?

844
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:23,217
I'm pouring
my heart out, man.

845
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:25,152
And I'm very sorry.

846
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,154
- But we met in AA.
- Chris!

847
00:50:27,254 --> 00:50:29,256
You're in the mafia.

848
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:37,231
Fine.

849
00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:42,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

850
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:45,299
Early night, huh?

851
00:51:47,468 --> 00:51:48,903
...they're slouching up
57th street,

852
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:51,338
so next time we're in
the city, I want to go.

853
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:53,841
What's this?
Party time?

854
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:56,310
Rachael Ray was on "Leno."
We got hungry.

855
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,145
Sit down,
I'll get some plates.

856
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:02,650
Where were you guys?

857
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,218
- Frat party.
- Had a meeting.

858
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:06,253
Did you go out tonight?

859
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:07,721
I met a friend
for coffee.

860
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:09,190
That's probably why
you're still awake.

861
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:11,592
I guess so.

862
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:13,828
Miss Meadow
had a mystery date

863
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:16,430
- she refuses to discuss.
- oh yeah?

864
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,537
What are you doing?
Sit down.

865
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:26,006
I'm wired.
I don't know.

866
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,246
So what's the mystery?

867
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,014
That you had a date
begin with?

868
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:35,816
Bite me, okay?
