1
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,096
Fuck you doing?
Scared the piss
out of me.

2
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:56,599
Some things you don't
get into over the phone.

3
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,769
Got it.
Lorraine's at mass.

4
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,604
Watch out for Spencer.

5
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:05,275
- Who?
- Her fucking toy terrier's
a shit machine.

6
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,782
I talked
to some of the guys
about your misgivings.

7
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,350
Yeah?

8
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,992
Listen,
I've made a decision.

9
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:57,597
Take a walk in there.

10
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,133
What the fuck
you waiting for?
Get lost.

11
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,341
Historically, Carmine
always said the Sopranos

12
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:10,944
Are nothing more
than a glorified crew.

13
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:14,148
Plain and simple,
we decapitate

14
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:16,150
And we do business
with whatever's left.

15
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,020
- What?
- Nothing.

16
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,223
I agree in spirit,
but I gotta counsel.

17
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,558
This thing
should have been done
during John's era.

18
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,827
They got redundant
upper management--

19
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,629
Bleeds off
half the kick.

20
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,433
We take 'em out,
absorb the whole
fucking thing.

21
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:33,969
Take out an entire
fucking family?

22
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,238
Let me tell you
a couple or three things:

23
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,440
Forget Coco.
Forget fat dom

24
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,943
Who goes over to Jersey
and never comes back.

25
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:44,079
Forget my brother Billy.

26
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,614
Phil, Phil, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

27
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:49,884
Anthony Soprano has
no respect for this thing.

28
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,855
He's never been
in the can, not really.

29
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:56,492
He's a guy who stepped over
his own uncle to grab
the big seat--

30
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:58,427
His father's brother.

31
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:00,663
- Please, huh?
- I'm embarrassed.

32
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:02,865
I let him come
to the hospital
last Christmas

33
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,267
And I took his
fat fucking hand
in friendship.

34
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,436
Philly, you had
a heart attack.

35
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:11,140
Listen to me.
They make anybody
and everybody over there.

36
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:13,677
And the way that
they do it is all
fucked up.

37
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,779
Guys don't get
their finger pricked.

38
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,614
There's no sword
and gun on the table.

39
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,483
- Phil.
- No, Alb.

40
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:22,219
Either it has meaning
or no meaning.

41
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,956
And the Vito thing--
the man harbors a faggot.

42
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,835
There's no scraps
in my scrapbook.

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,409
Make it happen.

44
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:58,057
I like the way she
played basketball
yesterday.

45
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:00,359
Almost got my first
hard-on in, like,
a month.

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,096
Jesus, what's the meaning
of quiet time around here?

47
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,017
- Rhiannon?
- A.J.?

48
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:26,319
Jesus.

49
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:32,293
What are you doing here?

50
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,595
You first.

51
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:37,631
I have some food issues,
depression.

52
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:40,034
- You keep up with Hernan?
- He's a fucking slimeball.

53
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,770
I caught him finger-banging
my cousin on the ski lift.

54
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,372
Well, somebody said
you were modeling.

55
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,774
Yeah, I guess.

56
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,809
I signed with elite.

57
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:51,480
So you would say
he's responding
to the therapy.

58
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,516
Well, we don't do
traditional therapy
per se.

59
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:57,653
Kids in crisis mostly need
an environment of calm,

60
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:59,054
No stresses.

61
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:02,557
Do you want this?
Or I can pop it
in the mail.

62
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,432
Just one more week
of this.

63
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:14,103
$2,200 a fucking day.

64
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,900
Gabagool', provolone

65
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:47,037
And vinegar peppers.

66
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:01,052
You believe this
fucking weather?

67
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,656
End times, huh?
Ready for the rapture.

68
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:07,993
How's the antiterror
going?

69
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,596
Great if you don't
like sleeping, eating
or seeing your kids.

70
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,438
Listen, those arabs
from the bing--

71
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,139
- Mm-hmm.
- Let me ask you the truth.

72
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,475
They're in Jordan, right,
getting their balls zapped?

73
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,511
You're not gonna tell me?

74
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm not really sure.
For all we know,

75
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,316
They may be harmless
pistachio salesmen.

76
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,654
Don't get so bent out
of shape. You're a big
boy, Tony.

77
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:36,890
You know, World War II,
your outfit protected

78
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,892
The Brooklyn navy yard.

79
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,194
You think Roosevelt
told Vito Genovese

80
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,064
- Where Hitler was holed up?
- Go fuck yourself.

81
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,247
Tony, Tony, hold up.

82
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,115
Tony.

83
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,717
What?

84
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:06,988
Look, I appreciate
what you did giving
us those names.

85
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,824
In fact, I've been
sitting here thinking...

86
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:14,730
Remember that thing
I told you about that
was supposed to happen

87
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,533
About a year ago,
your problem with Brooklyn?

88
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:21,203
It's on again possibly.

89
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:25,808
You, maybe people
close to you.

90
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:27,710
If it was real solid,
you would have been
warned officially

91
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,345
By the Newark office,
but my colleague in Brooklyn,

92
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:32,949
The one
with the collaborator,

93
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,118
Snitch is implying
the wheels have already
been set in motion.

94
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,786
Implying.

95
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:57,074
Where the fuck
you been?

96
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,310
Krista fell off
her shoes last night.

97
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,312
We had
to call an ambulance.

98
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:04,782
I had some shit
I was taking care of.

99
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:10,087
You're gonna
want a snort.

100
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,290
Come on, I just
finished my bialy.

101
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,492
Take it.

102
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:19,898
Burt Gervasi,
he's gone.

103
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,701
What happened?

104
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:24,836
I didn't want
to overload you with
A.J. In the hospital.

105
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:28,774
I don't wanna
hear that. Go.

106
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,543
Burt let me know
the other night

107
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:33,980
He's been playing both
sides of the fence
with New York.

108
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,749
- Burt?
- Measures were taken.

109
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:44,123
Burt wasn't speaking
for just himself.

110
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,025
Guys are getting
squeezed hard

111
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,760
To sway them towards
new management.

112
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,162
They thought you'd
be a part of it.

113
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,499
And he got an answer.

114
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:01,508
My hope is maybe now
Phil gets the message.

115
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:05,712
- You know, we can talk
this shit through.
- Talk?

116
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,924
Talking about Phil.

117
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,794
- We're gonna hit first.

118
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:25,533
And this all dovetails
with other information
I got that this cocksucker

119
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,002
Already has a target
on my back.

120
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:30,238
It's a big move.

121
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,475
So...

122
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,578
Buddha.

123
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:38,380
When he stuck you
with the tab for Vito Jr.,

124
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,716
I said let it go.

125
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,652
Obviously, truth is,
a fuck like Phil,

126
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,254
Appeasement don't work.

127
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,263
Oh, yeah.

128
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,392
Three pops
within a tight time frame,

129
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:24,495
24 hours, so there's no chance
for them to hit back.

130
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,031
<i>Top three guys.</i>

131
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,532
<i>- Paulie Gaultieri?
- No, management.</i>

132
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,968
Tony Soprano, obviously,

133
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,440
Plus Silvio Dante
and we think Bobby Baccalieri.

134
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,308
That mortadella's
number three?

135
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,377
He used to be
junior Soprano's driver.

136
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:41,980
And you used to sell
laser printers out the back
of your crown vic.

137
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,759
- You really slept.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,161
I wasn't asleep.

139
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:57,097
You want some oatmeal?
I'll make some.

140
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:59,532
You want instant
or the real thing?
I have half and half.

141
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,601
I can't find my belt.

142
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,504
It must be
up there somewhere.

143
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,739
What?
You hid it.

144
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,812
I'll make the real thing.

145
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,947
- You'll let me know
when it's ready?
- Sure.

146
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,292
You know,
my game has got--

147
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,032
Code six.
I have a casualty.
He's urgent.

148
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,068
<i>
i response,</i>

149
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,204
<i>The insurgents unleash
a devastating wave</i>

150
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,039
<i>Of ieds</i>

151
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,076
<i>- and suicide bombers.</i>

152
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,812
<i>who got hit?
You got contact with them?</i>

153
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,416
<i> on a small but
deadly road...</i>

154
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,251
<i>who's that gunner
right there?</i>

155
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,326
Anthony.

156
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,130
Regarding our friend
with the gray hair--

157
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>I thought about it.
I want you to call Italy,</i>

158
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,434
Get some cousins
of ours over.

159
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,306
Who you want
to run the thing?

160
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:14,878
Got it.

161
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,247
Gotta get some tires
for Carmela's car.

162
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,820
- The wine's amazing.

163
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,157
Jennifer's our resident
italian wine expert.

164
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,227
Is Megan still in Prague,
Stace?

165
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:33,564
Jesus, her love life.
The girl she was
involved with, Cecily,

166
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:37,368
She's now having a torrid
pen-and-paper relationship

167
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,237
With an armed robber
in Attica.

168
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,206
What is this fascination
with criminals?

169
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,741
Rescue fantasy.
They think they
can fix them.

170
00:13:43,742 --> 00:13:45,576
I'm worried for Cecily.

171
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:49,013
So I googled any new stuff
on sociopathic personalities.

172
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:51,617
Apparently,
the talking cure

173
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:53,919
Actually helps them
become better criminals.

174
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,854
<i>It was fascinating.</i>

175
00:13:55,855 --> 00:14:00,225
The study was
by Yochelson and Samenow.

176
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:03,762
Studies turn around
every few years.

177
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:05,798
This other,
I think it was
Robert Hare,

178
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,800
Suggested
that sociopaths

179
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,802
Actually quite glibly

180
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:13,140
Engage on key issues,
like mother, family.

181
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,242
I seem to remember that
from residency.

182
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:17,244
Me too,
and I've read Hare,

183
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:19,813
But who's
a true sociopath?

184
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:22,983
<i>I had a guy
at the state asylum,</i>

185
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:26,353
Slow poisoner.
They even mimic empathy.

186
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,422
<i>They blubber and cry.</i>

187
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,825
Did you put her up
to this?

188
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,228
She just happened
to mention this study?

189
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:36,597
- Who? Me?
- Everything okay down there?

190
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,433
I don't know.

191
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:41,169
It's a study.
Food for thought.

192
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,770
She's blowing us off.

193
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:46,007
You just can't resist
rubbing my face in it.

194
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:48,609
I feel like
we should change the subject.

195
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:51,180
I only suggested you
reevaluate your work

196
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,383
With leadbelly
or be prepared
to deal with moral

197
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:56,452
<i>And possibly
legal consequences.</i>

198
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,321
- Leadbelly?
- Who's that?
Come on.

199
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:02,491
The answer is
a female opera singer

200
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,493
And gangster...

201
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,664
Elliot!

202
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,900
<i>Soprano.</i>

203
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:14,537
- Tony Soprano?
He's your patient?
- Wow.

204
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,207
<i>- That's pretty cool.
- Jesus Christ, Elliot.</i>

205
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,142
Chill out.
We're among friends.

206
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,744
We're all professionals.

207
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,317
So what's your verdict
on the wine, Jen?

208
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,486
All italians have
big noses.

209
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:33,157
If I had made that joke
about other groups

210
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:35,493
Represented
at this table,

211
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,561
I would be called
a bigot.

212
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:40,197
<i>I meant italian reds.</i>

213
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,503
Still, it must be
fascinating work.

214
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,405
It is.

215
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:14,133
Have a seat.

216
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,470
<i>- What's up?
- Phil Leotardo.</i>

217
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:21,374
Calls were made to zips.
They're coming over
from Naples.

218
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,476
You contact the guy
to contact the guys.

219
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:26,646
Phil's at his goomar's
every Friday night.

220
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:28,915
- T know about this?
- What?

221
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,885
- What kind of question is that?
- Watch your fat fucking mouth.

222
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:35,322
Hey, whoa whoa
whoa whoa. What are
you concerned about?

223
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:37,691
I lived through the '70s
by the skin of my nuts

224
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,893
When the columbos
were going at it.

225
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:42,563
There ain't a bigger
cocksucker than
Phil Leotardo.

226
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,965
I just wanna make sure
somebody knows

227
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,868
There could be a line
of cozarellis a mile long.

228
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,205
Duly noted. So there's
no problem then.

229
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,444
The criminal's

230
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,938
sentimentality

231
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,123
reveals

232
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,586
itself in

233
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:10,044
compassion

234
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:11,472
for babies

235
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:13,391
and pets.

236
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:16,837
The criminal

237
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,788
uses insight

238
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,115
to justify

239
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,823
heinous acts.

240
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:23,881
Therapy has

241
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,411
potential for

242
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,135
noncriminals;

243
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:29,623
for criminals

244
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:31,197
it becomes

245
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:32,580
one more

246
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,169
criminal

247
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,131
operation

248
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,797
Don't worry about them.

249
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,965
Paulie, those guys
are outside.

250
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,302
Fuck you talking
so loud for?

251
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,639
<i>Don't discuss this
until we're in
the piscia dun.</i>

252
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,644
It's all yours.

253
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,988
I just picked 'em up
at the airport.

254
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,710
<i>Anthony.</i>

255
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:19,394
So what do you clear
a year around here?

256
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:21,963
I don't mean
to pry, you know,
just round numbers.

257
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,906
I'm asking
because Meadow--

258
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,509
Well, I told
you she's taking
pre-med classes--

259
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,913
Well, she's not
gonna be a doctor.

260
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:40,350
She told us.

261
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,153
It's kind of sad,
isn't it?

262
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:45,755
Depends.

263
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:48,791
It's just a nice thing
to be,

264
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,527
Helping sick babies.

265
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,763
Her change of heart
bothers you?

266
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:55,866
Her mother too,
much more than me.

267
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,534
<i>I mean,
all that worrying--</i>

268
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,571
Which private school,
columbia university,

269
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:03,607
This and that,
and in the end

270
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:06,343
She'll get married,
squeeze out some kids

271
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,479
After what, a couple yea
in the work force?

272
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,715
- I'm still working.
- Yeah, but you're divorced.

273
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:16,955
Criminal law,
that's what she's taking up.

274
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:19,958
And I told Carmela,
it's not the end
of the world.

275
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,728
She's interested

276
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:26,498
In civil rights--

277
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,534
Muslims and blacks

278
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:32,405
And that and a dime.

279
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,042
Hopefully, she'll wind up
at a big firm--

280
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:41,013
White-collar crime.

281
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,617
<i>Just, you know,</i>

282
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,219
Dr. Soprano.

283
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,258
Sounds nice.

284
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,831
Your parents must
have been very proud.

285
00:20:57,832 --> 00:20:59,533
I think so.

286
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,835
Look at all the people
like me you've helped.

287
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,439
With all
the human suffering
in this world,

288
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
You've done
something important...

289
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:12,847
Like those people

290
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,916
Who are trying
to help my son.

291
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,021
God bless 'em.

292
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,458
$2,000 a day
in that place,

293
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,860
But if it helps--

294
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,429
And as you know,
my plumbers' union
insurance

295
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,032
Only covers 10%
of mental.

296
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,605
He's really hurting--

297
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:38,874
A.J.

298
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:40,876
And you?

299
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:43,145
Although, maybe,
you know--

300
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,681
You know what?
Forget his hurts.
Maybe I should have just--

301
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:47,149
Put your shoe
up his ass?

302
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,386
Yeah yeah, frankly.

303
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:54,090
Well, we talked
about this.

304
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,159
Untalked about it.

305
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,061
Huh?

306
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,698
- Anyway, Carmela--
- Molly coddled him.

307
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,334
- My old man--
- Are you a shining example

308
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:07,404
For the huge collection
of wingtips and loafers

309
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:10,473
That must be lodged up
your lower bowel?

310
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:12,944
What's the matter
with you?

311
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,746
Is it because I said
that about being divorced?

312
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:18,149
You were saying.

313
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,518
He's my only son.

314
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,888
He's young.
Most of the time
they pull out of this.

315
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,991
But I've been depressed
for years. What if
he don't pull out?

316
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,160
So the boy who
never cared

317
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:31,196
About anything

318
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:33,932
Now cares
about too much.

319
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,734
Yeah, I guess.

320
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:38,937
And the daughter,
like all females,

321
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:42,141
Ultimately somehow
disappoints.

322
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:44,543
- I didn't say that.
- Oh.

323
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:47,145
What's with the tone?

324
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,447
You sound like
you're glad

325
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,284
I'm taking it
on the chin.

326
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,053
Maybe you're projecting
hostile feelings.

327
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:57,823
Bullshit.
If we had instant replay,

328
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,225
You'd see it
in two seconds.

329
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:01,161
Well, we don't have
instant replay.

330
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,664
I know that.
Jesus Christ, you sound
like my fucking wife.

331
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:07,467
- Your "fucking wife."
- You know what I mean.

332
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,136
The "departures"
magazine out there,

333
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,139
Did you give any thought
at all

334
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,276
To someone else
who might wanna read it

335
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:19,480
- Before you tore out
the entire page?
- What?

336
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,583
It's not the first time
you've defaced my
reading materials.

337
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,885
You saw that, huh?

338
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,821
People tear shit out
of your magazines
all the time.

339
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,391
They're a mess.
I try to read 'em.

340
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:32,594
I don't think
I can help you.

341
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,496
Well, change 'em.
Bring in some new shit.

342
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,264
I mean, therapeutically.

343
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:42,570
What are you
talking about?

344
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,473
I've only missed three
appointments since we
had that heart-to-heart.

345
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,209
The new big thing
these days is called

346
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,545
"psychodynamic therapy"

347
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,648
Combined with anafranil.

348
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:55,851
- Who?
- A medication. There's
a doctor in bloomfield

349
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:56,986
You could see.

350
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:59,755
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
okay.

351
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,624
Now what the fuck
is this?

352
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,459
You're firing me

353
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,262
'cause I defaced
your "departures" magazine?

354
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:09,699
I'm giving you my considered
medical opinion.

355
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:12,202
Okay, I should
have asked you

356
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:14,471
For the steak recipe.

357
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:19,276
And missing sessions,
unfortunately, is part
of my condition.

358
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:22,279
What do you know
about your condition?

359
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,716
You miss appointments because
you don't give a shit

360
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:28,251
About commitments,
about what I do,

361
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:31,855
About the body of work
that's gone into

362
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:34,158
Building up
this science.

363
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:41,532
Go ahead, tell me again
I sound like your wife.

364
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:42,900
Well,
if the shoe fits...

365
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:48,005
We're making progress.
It's been seven years.

366
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,775
Do you want some names?

367
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:53,945
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna tell
you something

368
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:54,947
And you're not
gonna like it,

369
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:57,516
- But we can say anything
in here, right?
- Go ahead!

370
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,420
I'm chalking this
all up

371
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:04,923
To female menopausal
situations.

372
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:07,092
You're not
my gynecologist.

373
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:10,195
Well, you don't need
a gynecologist to know
which way the wind blows.

374
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:20,673
So wait a minute,

375
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,375
You're telling me

376
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,210
After all this time,

377
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:27,680
<i>After everything
we shared in here,</i>

378
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:30,784
You're cutting me loose
just as my son got out
of the hospital

379
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,720
For trying
to kill himself?

380
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,458
Since you are in crisis,

381
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,393
I don't want to waste
your time.

382
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:44,031
I'm gonna be
fucking honest.

383
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,633
As a doctor,

384
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:48,202
I think what you're
doing is immoral.

385
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:06,384
<i>Yes.</i>

386
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:08,319
d.H.L.

387
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,955
- Who?
- Package-a,

388
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:14,393
D.H.L. Express
for mr. Philip.

389
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:17,797
For sign.

390
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,503
For sign.

391
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,040
What are you doing?

392
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:35,602
Dad! Dad!

393
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,006
They have shot me, daddy.

394
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:05,815
Yeah.

395
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,035
- Yeah.
- It's done.

396
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,004
I think the love interest
got in the way, though.

397
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:03,441
<i>Couldn't be helped
apparently.</i>

398
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,277
<i>You ever see Phil
with the goomar?</i>

399
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,446
Once maybe.
Why?

400
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,081
Could he talk to her
in ukrainian?

401
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,551
Ukrainian?
The fuck do I know?

402
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:16,388
I gotta go.

403
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,697
Paulie, it's done.

404
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,979
Listen, I--

405
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,548
I quit therapy.

406
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:45,818
And this time
I'm never going back.

407
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,090
Except for that slight
improvement around
the shooting,

408
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,093
She wasn't doing you
much good anyway.

409
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,563
Here we go.

410
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:59,199
- Hi, strangers,
how are you?
- How are you?

411
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,169
- Good, not bad.
- Good good.

412
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,670
There they are.

413
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,273
So mead' was in here

414
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:07,775
With patrick parisi.

415
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,110
- Yeah.
- We are very happy.

416
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,946
Very happy.

417
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:14,182
Is it true what she said?
She's quitting pre-med?

418
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:18,019
Yes, thank god.
We are so relieved.

419
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,355
You know, with aids
and...

420
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:21,923
It's not just that.

421
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:24,659
I don't know one doctor
who is advising his
children

422
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,996
To go into medicine.
Between the insurance
companies

423
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:29,464
Over their shoulder,

424
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,300
The hospitals
are making cutbacks...

425
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,669
She'd have been good
at it, though, mead'.

426
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,405
Always intellectually
curious, even as a tyke.

427
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:38,808
But does compassion
come naturally to her?

428
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,610
Patience?
I'm not so sure.

429
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,112
What are you
talking about?

430
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:44,847
So what is she
gonna do now?

431
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:47,316
- Well...
- Law.

432
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:49,785
<i>- Oh!
- Constitutional law.</i>

433
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,122
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

434
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:54,624
What about A.J.?
How's he doing?

435
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,194
- He's good. He's good.
- Good.

436
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,966
Ton', you know
who's in tonight?

437
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:04,568
"mangenius."

438
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:09,039
<i>The's the jets
coach, sweetie.</i>

439
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,276
- I should go say hello.
- Okay.

440
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:17,949
So Mead'
and Patrick Parisi?

441
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,153
Little awkward
though, maybe.

442
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,224
Patsy still works for Tony.
He's an underling.

443
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:30,061
Cupid's dart lands,
you know?

444
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,731
I'm gonna send some
limoncellos over
in celebration.

445
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,033
Great.

446
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,712
You don't answer
your fucking phone?

447
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:49,615
- I tried you 50 times
last night.
- Nah, we shut 'em off.

448
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,151
Gab came down
with a terrible case
of food poisoning.

449
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:57,957
You can pass the word
upstairs. The gray
goose is gone.

450
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,027
- Good.
- Apparently, the goomar had
to be taken out too.

451
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:03,163
But I say,
who gives a fuck?

452
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:06,866
Remember that drunken
fucking scene she caused
at the "Jersey boys" party?

453
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,035
I actually felt bad
for Phil.

454
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,874
What's the matter?

455
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,776
Whenever I think
of that fucking play,

456
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:18,245
I picture ma dying alone

457
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:21,148
Like a dog on that bus.

458
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,951
You're gonna make
someone happy with this
news today.

459
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:27,388
Think I'll ask
for some time off.

460
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:30,891
Hey, who does this
look like? Look.

461
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:56,152
Don't cry. Good little
girls don't cry.
Babies cry.

462
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:00,523
<i>Hey.</i>

463
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,326
- How's it going?
- Good.

464
00:33:03,627 --> 00:33:05,762
Have my card game.

465
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,964
Carm volunteered
to take Nica.

466
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:12,002
Emptying the pool, huh?

467
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:14,872
- Cost a fortune to heat.
- Yeah.

468
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:18,642
What can I do you for?

469
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:20,811
Had a call
from Mario Diaco.

470
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:23,480
- Who's that?
- Uncle Jun's accountant,

471
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:27,051
The one with the artificial voice spot.
Says he's trying to reach you

472
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:29,920
<i>For two weeks.</i>

473
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,825
Uncle Jun's finally
out of money.

474
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:36,928
They think that
maybe there's some
squirreled around,

475
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,530
But he can't remember.

476
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,667
It's a fucking sin,
isn't it?

477
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,204
Plus, with the larynx,
he thinks Mario's

478
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:48,406
From outer space,
so...

479
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:50,375
<i>The upshot is
he can't pay</i>

480
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:52,445
For living at wycoff
psychiatric anymore,

481
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:54,980
And they're gonna move him
to a state facility.

482
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,384
I know, Tony,

483
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:01,587
But Jesus, those fucking
places are snake pits.

484
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,622
Then he'll make
some new friends.

485
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,560
I understand.

486
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,395
You gonna bail him out?

487
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:12,165
We don't have
that kind of money.
We'd contribute.

488
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:17,804
Bobby feels...

489
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,039
You know.

490
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:23,677
Right.

491
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,051
You got a lot of balls
coming to me.

492
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:34,556
And as for your husband,
Janice,

493
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:37,825
<i>- "Exile on main street."
- Don't say that.</i>

494
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,627
You trust a guy,
you bring him along

495
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:41,963
And for what?

496
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:44,766
<i>He feels sorry
for junior?</i>

497
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:53,575
Bullshit.

498
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:08,524
Ton', it's bad news.

499
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:17,567
Paulie said he wants
it known it's on him,

500
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:19,802
He takes full
responsibility,

501
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,071
But that he
didn't do nothing.

502
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,542
Shit.

503
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:29,045
Yeah, nobody,

504
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:32,383
I mean nobody, knows
where the fuck Phil is,

505
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,785
Four, five days now.

506
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:37,388
So we never really had
a shot at him.

507
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,559
How about the house
in Florida?

508
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,227
I had beans send
somebody past.

509
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,229
The house is all
shuttered up.

510
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,898
He put everything in place,
his moves on us.

511
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,434
He goes into hiding,
waits it out.

512
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,738
Going to ground,
they call it.

513
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:54,506
Who?

514
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:57,275
It's an expression.

515
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,980
Who knows what the fuck
he's got planned exactly.

516
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:04,916
You get word to everybody:
eyes in the back
of your head,

517
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:09,020
Break routines, collections,
all that shit.

518
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:13,992
- You tell everybody.
Got it.

519
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:18,097
In the meantime,
we keep trying.
Get a 20 on Phil.

520
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:47,094
- Beautiful.
- You never see a blue comet

521
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:50,330
In that condition.
I mean, look at the coaches.

522
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:53,067
Every window
still lights up.

523
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,303
If that train still ran
New York to A.C.,

524
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:58,473
Atlantic City would be
a much different place
today.

525
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,576
- Better class of people.
- I suppose.

526
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:04,279
Who the fuck
really knows?

527
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,783
Still, it's nice
to think that.

528
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:10,485
Imagine riding
in that club car,

529
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,121
<i>Sipping on a negroni.</i>

530
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:15,991
Eight grand
for the whole set, huh?

531
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,928
There's other people
interested.

532
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:28,003
I'm gonna go for it.

533
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:29,905
Your son will
like this too.

534
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:32,008
Looks fast.

535
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:36,413
He don't care.

536
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:24,162
- Hurry up,
for Christ's sake.
- All right, aspett'.

537
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:27,099
If I'm gonna be working
away from the office,
I should have this stuff.

538
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,333
You wanna make
yourself useful?

539
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:31,036
Get the girls' pay slips
over there.

540
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:34,040
Put 'em in a bag.
Or give 'em to me.

541
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,377
Come on.

542
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:42,916
All right.

543
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,366
Let's go.

544
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:04,572
- Yeah, that's them there.
- Fuck!

545
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:06,607
What the fuck?

546
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,668
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

547
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:14,012
Wait here.

548
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:22,787
Melissa found a memory stick
in my prada bag that
wasn't printed.

549
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,123
God, remember what
a dick this guy was
at first?

550
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:26,359
<i>Yeah.</i>

551
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:31,197
I need to talk to you.

552
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,409
- Nobody called you?
- No. What's the matter?

553
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:48,247
Bobby's dead. He's shot.
Sil's in the hospital.

554
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,749
- What happened?
- Could be several things.

555
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:58,425
- "leave here"? What are you talking about?
- just temporarily,

556
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:00,794
- till we get the situation
under control.
- what does that mean?

557
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:02,963
Carm, help me out here.
Don't argue.

558
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,132
- You mean they're after you.
- We should split up.

559
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,868
You and the kids go.
I'll be somewhere else.

560
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,503
<i>- Oh my god!
- Now look,</i>

561
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,539
Families don't get touched.
You know that, hmm?

562
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,408
<i>I just wanna know</i>

563
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,443
Every night that
you're not sitting here
out in the open.

564
00:41:15,444 --> 00:41:17,024
Where should I go?
Where are you gonna go?

565
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:18,012
The house you just bought,

566
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:20,782
- The estate sale--
go there.
- Oh, Jesus.

567
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:22,817
A hotel then.
It doesn't fucking matter.

568
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:28,756
- Okay.
- You all right?

569
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,426
All right,
we gotta get moving.

570
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:31,694
And like I said,
it's just a precaution.

571
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:34,330
- What about your sister?
- She's gotta know by now.

572
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:37,499
We'll stop over there
after we're cleared out
of here.

573
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,935
- And Gab? How bad is Sil?
- We'll make some calls.

574
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,571
- Maybe I should go on ahead
of you over to Jan's.

575
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:44,106
- Carm...
- Meadow is basically living
at Patrick's, thank god.

576
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:45,874
A.J... how are you gonna
get him to go along?

577
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,544
- He won't leave the house.
- He's gonna leave the house.

578
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:50,212
- Tony...
- On a piece of plywood

579
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:52,215
If necessary, but he's
gonna leave the house.

580
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,351
Anything I can do?

581
00:41:54,352 --> 00:41:55,652
- No.
- You heard?

582
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:59,089
- Or maybe I should just leave.
- I'll call you.

583
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:03,025
It says shukrijumah
brought nuclear material

584
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:05,362
Into the country
from mexico in 2002.

585
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,263
Fuck.

586
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,768
Leave us alone, hon.

587
00:42:12,104 --> 00:42:15,139
- Hang downstairs.
- Better yet, don't.

588
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,514
You just bust in?
We could have been
doing anything.

589
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:26,317
Yeah, but what
were you doing? Nothing.

590
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:28,886
We're just friends.

591
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:33,258
All right, listen.

592
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,826
Come, sit .

593
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,362
Come on.

594
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,869
Your uncle Bobby's dead.

595
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,472
- What?
- He's dead. He got shot.

596
00:42:47,473 --> 00:42:49,574
- What do you mean,
"he got shot"?
- Listen to me,

597
00:42:49,576 --> 00:42:53,546
And I don't have any time
to go into a debate about
any of this, okay?

598
00:42:53,547 --> 00:42:56,683
And it's important
that we all leave

599
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:59,886
For a little while
until things settle down.

600
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:03,023
What? Holy fuck.

601
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:05,858
It's just a precaution.

602
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:09,095
The point is that...

603
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:11,999
I'm gonna be dependent
on you to help out
your mother.

604
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,134
- Help out how?
- Just do what she asks,

605
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:17,304
You know, chores,
tasks,

606
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:19,707
Whatever.

607
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,709
And don't add
to the problem.

608
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,044
What do you mean?
What the fuck did I do?

609
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:27,448
Don't break her balls,
all right, huh?

610
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:31,151
Just help her

611
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,054
With Aunt Janice,
whatever.

612
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:37,225
Uncle Bobby's dead.

613
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:39,527
Yeah.

614
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:44,165
This is really
depressing to me.

615
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,570
He was a good guy.

616
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:52,207
I was already having
so much trouble maintaining.

617
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,588
<i>My tailbone!</i>

618
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,823
Here, pack a bag.

619
00:44:07,824 --> 00:44:10,326
Now!

620
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,929
And you won't need
no sandals or fucking
resort wear.

621
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,833
I'll be waiting
downstairs.

622
00:44:57,276 --> 00:44:59,778
Oh my god.

623
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,780
Oh my god.

624
00:45:09,323 --> 00:45:12,492
I called the hospital.
They wouldn't give
no info on Sil.

625
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:14,794
Gab's brother
finally phoned back.

626
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,663
Doctors don't think
he'll recover consciousness.

627
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:37,952
<i> look at the stems
on blondie.</i>

628
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:40,988
Heh!
He's riding high.

629
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,024
Nice to be young, huh?

630
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:49,893
I'm gonna bunk down here.

631
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:51,830
All right, you go take care
of your wife,

632
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:54,499
That flu.

633
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:59,170
- You too.
- Where the fuck I gotta be?

634
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:00,739
Yeah, I'm gonna stay.

635
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,281
We order a pizz'.

636
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,618
Yeah.

637
00:47:18,158 --> 00:47:19,793
<i>Get some meatballs
and sausage too.</i>

638
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:23,195
<i> - Couple of salads.
- No vegetarian pizza.</i>

639
00:48:01,737 --> 00:48:04,472
<i>You probably don't
even hear it when it
happens, right?</i>

640
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:07,842
- Ask your friend in there,
on the wall.
