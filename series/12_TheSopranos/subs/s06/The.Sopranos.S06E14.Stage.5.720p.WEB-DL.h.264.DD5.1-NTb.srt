1
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,100
Frankie, where are you?

2
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,500
Welcome to the chop shop,
Cugine.

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
You can't kill
me twice, Sally boy.

4
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm already fucking
dead, remember?

5
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm the boss, Michael.
What you had belongs to me.

6
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,365
Even the girl I loved?

7
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,000
What's mine is mine.
What's yours is mine.

8
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Well...

9
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,800
This is mine too, Sally.

10
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
Now you can have it.

11
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
Vaffancul'.

12
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,800
Fuck Ben Kingsley.

13
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,600
Danny Baldwin took him
to fucking acting school.

14
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,600
Very well directed, Morgan.

15
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,300
I Think there's potentially more money
in this than in the porn we've done.

16
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,700
So what do we think?
We need the extra scene or not?

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,300
I like it the way it is.

18
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,900
I don't know, Rissy,
these audiences today love blood.

19
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,600
I tend to agree with Carlo.

20
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm thinking
one more sexy kill.

21
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
When Michael follows
Centrella to the strip club,

22
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,600
What if he chops up one
of the women?

23
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,600
Who as fate would have it,

24
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
Was at one time
Sally boy's mistress.

25
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,000
Two extra shoot days,
at a minimum.

26
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
- Kid, if it buys us a bullshit
theatrical release-

27
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm gonna have to get
more money from Tony.

28
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,500
I want this fucking thing
out there.

29
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,965
Yeah, T, what's up?

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
You talked to the guy
with the air mattresses?

31
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm in editing. We just
saw the cut of "cleaver. "

32
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,365
- And?
- Awesome as is.

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,100
The lawyer called, though. We
might have to change the title.

34
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
The Eldridge Cleaver estate,
they with an injunction.

35
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,300
Listen, if you wanna see some of it,
we're finishing the ADR after lunch.

36
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
- What's that again?
- Sound dubbing.

37
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
Just call this dispatcher.
It's a holiday weekend.

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Thousands of people will
be out at the beach.

39
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,765
I'm on it.

40
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,565
- He coming down?
- Please.

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,100
He don't give two shits
about production.

42
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,450
Mr. Sacrimoni,
how are you today?

43
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,800
Isn't that for you
to tell me?

44
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,200
I wish I had
better news.

45
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
Based on the latest pictures,

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
The cancer has continued to
metastasize from the lungs.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,000
We now show masses in the
mediastinal lymph nodes,

48
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,800
Both kidneys
and the brain.

49
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,200
The headaches.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
So the...

51
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,150
Lobectomy, radiation,

52
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:35,400
The goddamn chemo,

53
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,200
What was all that?
for kicks?

54
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,700
Those were our options
at the time.

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
And now what are
our options?

56
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
Limited to the extent that
I wouldn't recommend any.

57
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,900
At this point, we're looking at stage
four small cell carcinoma of the lungs.

58
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,400
- And there's no stage five.
- That's correct.

59
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,365
How long?

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,300
Difficult to say.

61
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
- I have seen miracles over the years.
- Forget the miracles.

62
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,400
Three months.

63
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,400
Give or take.

64
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,800
Thank you
for your candor.

65
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
We have a plane
back to Springfield.

66
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,900
How you doing, John?

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,600
It's funny-
ironic- whichever.

68
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,100
I got here.

69
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,100
I quit smoking
after 38 years,

70
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:42,300
Exercised, ate right.

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
And for what?

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Even still,

73
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,000
It was the right move.

74
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, there she is, my girl.

75
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:21,300
How are you, sweetie?

76
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

77
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,700
What did Rosen say?

78
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,700
- How's the hotel? You all settled in?
- It's fine.

79
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,100
- How are you, angel? You look beautiful.
- I'm good.

80
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,200
- Eric sends his love.
- That's nice.

81
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,400
John, what about Rosen?

82
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,400
I don't know. I...

83
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't know, sweetie.

84
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,700
- I'm very very sick.
- Oh my god.

85
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,400
All right, don't cry.

86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,900
Don't cry. You don't have to make
it any harder than it is, all right?

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
No physical contact,
please.

88
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,800
- I Love you, John.
- I Love you, too.

89
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,100
- Daddy.
- I Know. I Know.

90
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Ladies, no contact.

91
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,500
All right.

92
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,900
You come back,
you see me again tomorrow.

93
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,300
We have more time, huh?

94
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,800
Could I bum one of those?

95
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
It's casual, though, right?

96
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,100
It's your cousin's movie premiere.
We should dress accordingly.

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
It's what they call
a cast-and-crew screening.

98
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
It's in the city, Tony,

99
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,400
With an after-party
at some rooftop bar

100
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
In the meat-packing district.
That place is very chic now.

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Meat packers?
I'm a happily married man.

102
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm telling you it's not dress up.

103
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Speaking of dress up, Christopher told me

104
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Kelli is having her wedding
dress made into an outfit

105
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:56,300
- For the baby to be christened in.
- Oh, sweet.

106
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,500
You all right?

107
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,400
Are you taking a date
to the screening?

108
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
If I can meet
a normal guy, maybe.

109
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,300
I heard that

110
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,000
What, Finn wasn't normal?

111
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,465
I don't intend
to discuss Finn.

112
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,100
What about that guy
in your mcat review?

113
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,300
Please, he's completely
fixated his O-Chem final.

114
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,100
He wants to be a doctor.
Tell him it's educational.

115
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:33,100
There's body parts
all over this movie.

116
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,865
Hey, screw the movie. I
Just wanna hang with celebs.

117
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Why, you think you're gonna
get to sleep with Paris Hilton?

118
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,800
What? No.

119
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,965
Stop fidgeting
and eat your noodles.

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
- I don't want them.
- Where are you going?

121
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:50,200
The bathroom.
Jesus.

122
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,200
- Meow.
- You two have a fight?

123
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
I don't know.

124
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,800
Keep an eye on his temp, and we'll
finish out the week on the ceftin.

125
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:05,567
You rest now. I'll
see you in the morning.

126
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:08,300
- He should be on heparin.
- Excuse me.

127
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,200
Listen to him.
Check his ABG.

128
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm gonna have to ask you
again to not interfere, Warren.

129
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm gonna change your sheets.

130
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,700
So what are you,
The world's smartest orderly?

131
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,700
These days I am.

132
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,400
22 years a
practicing oncologist,

133
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Specializing
in cancers of the liver.

134
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,000
Roll to your right,
please.

135
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,100
Let me spare us
the awkwardness.

136
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I killed my wife.

137
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,800
Not that it's
any justification,

138
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
I had reason to suspect

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,565
She was cheating on me
with her chiropractor.

140
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,300
- Jesus.
- Granted, I was abusing cocaine at the time,

141
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,900
And alcohol.
But I came home one day

142
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,300
Shot her four times-
twice in the head.

143
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:05,900
I killed her aunt, too.

144
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,900
I didn't know she was there.
Roll over, please.

145
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
And the mailman.

146
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
At that point,
I had to fully commit.

147
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,100
Why are you here exactly?

148
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
I'Ve been accused
of being part

149
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,100
Of a certain
italian-american subculture.

150
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,900
hey, I know who you are.

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
I meant,
what's wrong with you?

152
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,900
Oh.

153
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,400
- Lungs.
- I'Ve been wanting to meet you, actually.

154
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,865
I saw you on Bill Curtis.

155
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,000
- Warren Feldman.
- John sacrimoni.

156
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,500
Good to know you.

157
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
- I take it you done chemo, huh?
- Twice.

158
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,400
Mind if I take a look
at your chart?

159
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,700
What about Gunga Din?

160
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Gupte? Fuck him.

161
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,665
Oh, you're seeing Rosen.

162
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,900
They let me fly
to cleveland, my expense.

163
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
- You know him?
- I saw him speak once

164
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:04,600
At an ASCO conference
in Georgia.

165
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:07,000
- Good man.
- But...

166
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,700
Actually, very few
people know this,

167
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,200
But he really can't walk
on water.

168
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,900
What was his prognosis?

169
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Three months.

170
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,800
- With the treatment you've had?
- What do you mean?

171
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,100
You got a window
of one to three years.

172
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
What about the metastases?

173
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
Two rounds of paraplatin,

174
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
Docetaxel and platinol

175
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Concurrent with radiation?

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
Come on, any cancer inside
you has slowed to a crawl.

177
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,565
Why is he so
fucking negative?

178
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,500
We tell the patient three months. He
lives a year. Who looks like a hero?

179
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,500
I'll see you around, John. You
take it easy. Hang in there.

180
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Fuck me.

181
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,600
Tony, morning.

182
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,700
You got a sec?

183
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,200
As I told you,
my partner and I are

184
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,300
With the joint terror
task force now.

185
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,765
You're around Port Newark
often enough.

186
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,100
We're concerned about what might come
through there from the middle east.

187
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:28,600
Yeah, and...

188
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Let's talk terror funding.

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Most of it comes about
through illegal enterprise.

190
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Our pitch is this, and it's the
same we gave Christopher Moltisanti-

191
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,300
If he never
mentioned it:

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600
If you or any of your people
ever heard of anything going down,

193
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,365
Middle easterners,
pakistanis,

194
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,600
You'd be helping us a lot
if you let us know.

195
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,400
I Think there's
a word for that.

196
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Your daughter takes
pre-med classes in New York.

197
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,100
She use the tunnels?

198
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Just something
to keep in mind.

199
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,700
That's the last time I'm
going down for the paper.

200
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,100
You tell that fucking
polack to get here earlier

201
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,165
And bring up the paper with her

202
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,700
Or she can go clean somebody
else's fucking toilets.

203
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
What happened?

204
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
It's too dangerous.
Has been for years.

205
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,100
May I have your
attention, please?

206
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,200
Welcome to the premiere
of "cleaver,"

207
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
The story of a young man
who goes to pieces

208
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,900
Then manages
to find himself again.

209
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,450
In all seriousness, however,

210
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,600
I'd like to say a few words.

211
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,100
Much like a child,
a film has many parents,

212
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,900
That is to say
many individuals

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
Who act like parents,

214
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:02,200
Or that by aversion,

215
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,065
The film is their baby.

216
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,050
I, as an executive producer,

217
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:09,000
Am one of those individuals.

218
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,665
Two more examples
are here with me tonight.

219
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,300
Ladies and gentlemen, my
Co-E.P. Christopher Moltisanti

220
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,700
And our director
Morgan Yam.

221
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah, hey!

222
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
I Know you're all psyched
to see the movie,

223
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
So I'm not gonna give
a big speech here.

224
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,200
I Just wanna give a shout out

225
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,400
To the man who without him

226
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,400
This whole thing would be
impossible. Where is he?

227
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Anthony Soprano, everybody.

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,700
- Hey!
- All right, Ton'!

229
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,100
Once he came on board,
the whole thing fell together.

230
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
And all the other
investors, too.

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Plus my wife Kelli and our
new baby. I Love you guys.

232
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay, then. Cell phones off

233
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
And hope you
like the movie.

234
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,600
You don't know what?
He's a fucking rat!

235
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,365
- But we can't really prove it.
- You're gonna argue with me?

236
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,900
No, it's just, I mean,
he's practically like your own son.

237
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm sorry, Sally. I think
we oughta give him a pass.

238
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,900
I didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

239
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,000
Motherfucking
son of a...

240
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,165
- That's you.
- No.

241
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
- It is.
- You find where this pezzonovante is

242
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,300
And you bring him
to the butcher shop.

243
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
They're gonna find pieces of this
kid all over fucking canarsie.

244
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,000
- Yeah.
- I'm sure he's fine, sweetie. You gotta relax.

245
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
But for Michael not to have called
and the wedding's in two days.

246
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,800
Who, the guatemalan?

247
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
What time is he gonna be there?

248
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,500
I hate to say this, but the truth
is he ain't good enough for you.

249
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,800
I mean, he's a good kid.

250
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,000
What you need is a man.

251
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
Tell him to put it in the trunk

252
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
Shh!

253
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,100
You know how long I've
been waiting to do that?

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,700
Dad, that was neat at the end, the
creepy figurine and the crucifix.

255
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm glad you caught that,
Alexandra. Very observant.

256
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:03,365
The sacred and the propane.

257
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
There's a ton of people wearing
t- shirts here. I told you.

258
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,065
Is it so horrible
you look nice?

259
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm starving. I need to
eat something already.

260
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,700
I asked if you wanted popcorn.

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,500
- You want me to make you a plate?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
- What?
- What? I'll give you what.

263
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Come here. The fucking
boss down in the cellar,

264
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:36,000
White bathrobe-
where'd you get that?

265
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:38,600
I don't know.
Artistic choice.

266
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,865
Seriously though,
I'm very proud.

267
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,300
Whatever else happens,
you made a movie, Christopher.

268
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Nobody could
take that away.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
A hundred years from now,
we're dead and gone,

270
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
People will be watching
this fucking thing.

271
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,800
You know how much Imperia
vodka I scored just

272
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,700
From this
party alone?

273
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
I had a couple of cases
put down in your car, too.

274
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,900
Look at this-
the family of early man.

275
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,265
Great, thank you.

276
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
Hey, Danny, come here.

277
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Take a picture
with us. Phil Leotardo.

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,200
Larry and I hung out at the set.
I don't know if you know this,

279
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,800
But the actors, they don't
make up what they say.

280
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,700
- It's true. Even De Niro, the girl told me.
- The script girl.

281
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:30,000
- Lorenzo Barese.
- Hey, how you doing, my friend?

282
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,965
You getting enough to eat?

283
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Bryan Rawley,
u. s. Marshal's service.

284
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,800
Terms of your bail confine
you to your home, sir.

285
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,665
- Say hello to Danny?
- Yeah.

286
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,300
- Larry!
- Call the fucking lawyer!

287
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,165
- Larry!
- Excuse us, excuse us.

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
- Excuse us, excuse us.
- Leave him alone, you bastard!

289
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Jesus Christ.

290
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
There's Danny's manager.
I Better go talk to him.

291
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,100
There he is.

292
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,100
So how was Florida?

293
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,300
Hot and sticky,
like my balls.

294
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,900
I spoke to Ginny.
She's a wreck.

295
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,900
John's in the cancer ward.

296
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,900
She's down the road
in some fucking motel.

297
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,900
Poor prick.

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,900
Prison's not bad enough,
fucking lung cancer to boot.

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,900
Tell me about it-
quintuple bypass,

300
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Then the infection,

301
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Seven months
of physical thery.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm just now starting
to get back to myself again.

303
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,965
Sausage, cioppino,
anything spicy

304
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Put me back in the emergency
room, I'm not careful.

305
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,100
All in all,
we're lucky fucks.

306
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
I tell myself that
every day.

307
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,200
So now you're back. How about
you straighten that family out?

308
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Not for me, Anthony.

309
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,900
Obviously, healthwise, being
a boss is a young man's game.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Between the joint fitters
and the carpenters,

311
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,200
Those envelopes are light
er 10% each week.

312
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
I feel it, too.

313
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,400
Well, word on the street is
Gerry's the favorite to take over.

314
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,800
He's my protege.
I don't stand in his way.

315
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,700
There's a ringing endorsement.

316
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,300
- Hey, Tony.
- Doc, Doc.

317
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
- You know Danny, huh?
- How you doing, Mr. Soprano?

318
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,200
Got a ticket on the Jersey turnpike.

319
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,600
Broken windshield wiper.
I said he should talk to you.

320
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,100
- I'll take care of it.
- That's not necessary.

321
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
- Let's take a picture here.
- All right, chill out, Doc.

322
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,300
If you're Phil Leotardo you cannot be happy

323
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,900
With the state of affairs,
despite appearances.

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
We're joined now via satellite
from Bainbridge Island, Washington,

325
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,500
By Jerry's fellow
mob expert Manny Safier,

326
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,000
The author of the new book
"The Wise Guide to Wiseguys. "

327
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
Manny, welcome to the program.
How goes the book tour?

328
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:47,900
Thank you, Geraldo.
Excellent.

329
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,565
- Jerry, how are you?
- Manny.

330
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,300
So we're discussing the apparent mob
power vacuum here in New York city.

331
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,800
Are you shocked that there's still
no successor to John Sacrimoni?

332
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Not really.

333
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
I Mean, the last 10, 12 years,

334
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,000
That's been
a dysfunctional family.

335
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,600
And as Jerry said earlier, there
are several viable candidates.

336
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,865
Well, viable,
I don't know.

337
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,300
You had Phil Leotardo
as the logical successor.

338
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:13,800
You also have
Gerardo "Gerry" Torciano,

339
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Also Faustino "Doc" Santoro,
who I believe is the frontrunner.

340
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm surprised you haven't
mentioned Carmine Lupertazzi, jr.

341
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,300
I Was about to, Manny,
before you interrupted.

342
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
In fact, if you take a
look at my book in chapter 14...

343
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,900
This Santoro thing,
I called it a year ago.

344
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,600
Hey.

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,300
Thank you for coming, Anthony.

346
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
I Know it's a long trip.

347
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,100
What, and miss a chance
to see Missouri?

348
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,300
So how's Jenny today?

349
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,500
She went with Allegra to buy
some stuff for the kitchenette.

350
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, good,
clear her mind.

351
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
Reason I asked
you here today,

352
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,900
She's a bright kid,
your sister.

353
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,100
But business...

354
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,165
My life insurance,

355
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,100
I Want to put her
on a monthly stipend.

356
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,865
Probably a good idea.

357
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,300
Not all the doctors agree,

358
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,900
But if I do only
have a few months,

359
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,365
I Wanna take care
of all this now.

360
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Wait a second.
Which doctor doesn't agree?

361
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,665
Feldman, the guy
I told you about.

362
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,300
- The wife murderer?
- He's still a doctor, Anthony.

363
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,700
He was a highly-respected
oncologist.

364
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:38,200
I Know, but, John-

365
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,865
He reviewed my case.

366
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,600
He says I could
hang on for years.

367
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,300
You're right. He still
has the knowledge.

368
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,300
I mean, O.J. is no less
of a running back, right?

369
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,000
Let me ask you
something, Anthony:

370
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
How will I be remembered?

371
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,500
A wonderful husband.

372
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,065
A loving father.

373
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,400
On the street,
though, I mean.

374
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,965
From what I know,
you were well-liked, John.

375
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,100
Respected across the board,
despite the allocution even.

376
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:19,600
God knows, guys have
actually named names

377
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,800
For a hell of a lot less than
what you were looking at.

378
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:24,200
The only nega-

379
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,000
What?

380
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
When Carmine died
and you took over,

381
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,300
People felt you changed,

382
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,700
Became a little
trigger-happy, maybe-

383
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
A hothead.

384
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,065
God forbid

385
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,900
Any of them
would find themselves

386
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,750
In that position.

387
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,500
It's a thankless job.

388
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,700
- What are you, hungover?
- What? I had two glasses of wine.

389
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:17,800
Why are you so pissy?

390
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,600
- The portrayal of that guy in the movie.
- What guy?

391
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
- The boss, Tony.
- What about him?

392
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:27,700
It was based on you.

393
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,700
Yeah, I know,
you said the yelling.

394
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,450
It wasn't just the yelling.

395
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:33,100
Imitation's a form of flattery.

396
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,100
- You think that was flattering?
- It was okay.

397
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,800
He's a tough prick, that Baldwin.

398
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,700
What about the girlfriend?

399
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,600
- What girlfriend?
- The cleaver guy.

400
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
The lead character.
His entire motive for revenge.

401
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,300
I don't know.
You lost me, Carm.

402
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,300
Sally boy, the boss,
he fucked the guy's fiancee.

403
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
The thing with Adriana?

404
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I told you it never
fucking happened.

405
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,800
Well, apparently,
your nephew feels otherwise.

406
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,000
Ro pointed it out to me, but if she
saw it, that means other people did.

407
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
It's a movie.
It's fictional.

408
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,500
It's a revenge fantasy, Tony,

409
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,100
Which ends with the boss's head
split open by a meat cleaver.

410
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,450
Oh, there he is.
Good time last night?

411
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah, it was all right.
How about you?

412
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,700
Gab had fucking nightmares.

413
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
- Club soda, hon.
- Sure.

414
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,700
So what did you think
of the movie?

415
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,900
Chrissy's the last person I
would have confused with Marty,

416
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,900
But I gotta say,
it wasn't bad.

417
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,600
- Is he around?
- Chrissy? Nah.

418
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,600
He don't come around here
no more, you know that.

419
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
That Baldwin was
pretty good, huh?

420
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,600
He was a mean fuck.
I'll give him that.

421
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
And that girl that played
the fiancee, she was hot,

422
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:15,000
The one he was fucking.

423
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,800
It's weird how it works,
the creative process.

424
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,800
I'm watching that movie
"Edward Scissorhands,"

425
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,000
When boom, all of a sudden,
it hits me.

426
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,700
What if instead of a pair of
scissors, it's a meat cleaver instead?

427
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,865
A couple years later,
you got a movie.

428
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,400
Originally, I thought a ball-peen
hammer, but a cleaver's better.

429
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,700
I tell ya, man, it's like
I'm living somebody else's life.

430
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,800
You're just not comfortable
with success yet.

431
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
I Know. It's scary.

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,365
Feel the fear and do it anyway.

433
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,500
Without chemicals, either.

434
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
So Kelli, the baby.

435
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,400
Good, fucking great.

436
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,900
She's a doll.
She cries a lot, though.

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,900
The baby, not Kelli.

438
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,300
I Hope you're taking the time

439
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,000
To reflect on all this.
Savor the good stuff.

440
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,900
Yeah- no, I am.

441
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,065
There's my other sober buddy.

442
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,100
- Is that an FBI guy?
- Your tax dollars at work.

443
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,300
Does he follow you
around all the time?

444
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,700
They drop in and out.
It's fun.

445
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,465
Look, seriously, think where
you were just three months ago.

446
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,400
You came into that meeting. yo were
so fucked up you could barely talk.

447
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,950
And that woman friend
was even worse.

448
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:53,365
I'Ve been trying
to do what you said-

449
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,200
Hold back a little, steer clear
of old habits, same people.

450
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,000
Must be hard, though,
given your lifestyle.

451
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,000
They already misinterpret, I
don't wanna hang around so much.

452
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,600
Fucking Paulie especially

453
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,665
Have you explained how hard
it is to be around alcohol?

454
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,100
- How familiar surroundings set it off?
- They don't give a fuck.

455
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,700
"But he's fucking my wife,
Carmine. I want him dead,"

456
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Jimmy says.

457
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,300
"He will be," he said,
"but not just right now.

458
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,565
He earns too much. "

459
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,550
Eight years later,
Jimmy gets a call one day.

460
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:35,500
"Remember that guy who
we were talking about

461
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,450
Who's fucking your wife?
He can go. "

462
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:41,300
The guy wasn't making
him money no more.

463
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
And that was
Carmine Lupertazzi.

464
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,500
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

465
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,065
There you are.
We went-

466
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,800
John, what the hell
are you doing?

467
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,665
- What?
- You're smoking.

468
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,300
- So?
- Daddy, you're on oxygen.

469
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,100
Warren, pardon me, I'm sorry.

470
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Just calm down, all right?

471
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,400
Calm down?
I don't fucking believe you.

472
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,900
what do I got to lose, Gin?

473
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,565
What's the difference?

474
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,400
You told me dr. Feldman
doesn't agree with the others.

475
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
- Yeah, well.
- Miracles do happen, John.

476
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,300
Not to this family
they don't.

477
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
It's that kind of attitude that probably
brought this on in the first place.

478
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:27,300
You're gonna start
with that again?

479
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,900
What about all these
six-year-olds with leukemia?

480
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
What's that from,
all their negative thinking?

481
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,100
All due respect,
he's a great guy, Doc,

482
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,600
But boss material?

483
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,200
Important thing's
we all work together,

484
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,100
Whoever winds up
in the driver's seat.

485
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,300
Phil, though,
I'll never get it.

486
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,900
The man was my mentor. It was
right there for the taking.

487
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,300
His heart, Gerry.
What was he gonna do?

488
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
That's my point, though,
what you just said.

489
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,200
Johnny goes away. It's Phil's
turn in the driver's seat,

490
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:14,300
And his heart gives out.

491
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,500
- Right.
- his heart.

492
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,865
I Know, what?

493
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,800
It's a metaphor. He lost
his balls is what I'm saying.

494
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,400
Just say it then.
Walt fucking Whitman over here.

495
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,400
- Ladies.
- Hey.

496
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,300
- How you doing?
- Should we get some more wine?

497
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,565
This fucking waiter,
on sabbatical?

498
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,100
What's the name of that
sangiovese we had at Quattro Gatti?

499
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:41,400
The night your-

500
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,400
Come on!

501
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
Let's go.

502
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Yeah, give me
five dimes a piece

503
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,365
On st. Louis,

504
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,700
Minnesota and Baltimore.

505
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
I Would have invited you to play,
but we already had our fourth.

506
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,800
You're not happy.

507
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,700
Let's order.

508
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,900
- What can I get you?
- Seared ahi, mixed greens

509
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,500
And an iced tea,
please.

510
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Philly cheesesteak.

511
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,400
You know what? Give me an Arnold
Palmer instead of the iced tea.

512
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,400
- Okay.
- I Always enjoy those,

513
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,300
- But it never occurs to me to order one.
- What the fuck, Carmine?

514
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
This family of yours.

515
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,900
Fucking senile Doc Santoro uses
one of my guys as a diversion?

516
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Sil could have got hurt.

517
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,300
Doc showed a lack of respect.

518
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,700
This fucking leadership, boy.

519
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:10,500
Step up, Carmine.

520
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
Get your hands around this thing.
You know you got the support.

521
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
You never thought you'd
mutter those words, did you?

522
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,400
What do you want me to say?

523
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,100
I hear you, Tony,
and I'm flattered.

524
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,700
But boss-
I don't think so,

525
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,700
Especially now that Doc
has cemented his position.

526
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
Phil was bad enough
in the top spot,

527
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
But him I could
have lived with.

528
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,300
Here you go.

529
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
There was a time I was
obsessed with being in charge.

530
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,800
- You remember?
- So do it.

531
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,500
One night around then
I had this dream.

532
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,000
It's my pop's 100th birthday, even
though he'd been dead for years.

533
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,600
The whole family's there-
grandkids, everybody.

534
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,300
He's wearing one of these
gold paper crowns,

535
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,900
Like at Burger King.
Anyway, I give him his present

536
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,050
This mellifluous box-
ribbons,

537
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,765
He opens it up
then looks at me.

538
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,300
This gaze of absolute
disappointment.

539
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,700
There's nothing in the box.

540
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,700
So he hands it back to me.

541
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,750
"Go fill it up," he says.

542
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,992
"Come back when I'm 200."

543
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:26,200
So go for it, Carmine.

544
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,700
Fulfill that part of yourself.

545
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,100
We have this ritual
at my house for years.

546
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Our kids are
in boarding school.

547
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,700
Every night I come home from work,
I strip down, jump naked in the pool.

548
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,400
Nicole brings me
a scotch and water.

549
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:43,765
We sit,
relax a little talk.

550
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I go up to bed,
the air conditioning.

551
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,100
She brings me a light
dinner on a tray.

552
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,700
One night during
all that fighting with John,

553
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:55,400
I Come home,
I'm exhausted.

554
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,200
So tired, so tense,
I skip the pool.

555
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,400
I go right upstairs,
flop on the bed.

556
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:04,500
Nicole comes up with a drink.

557
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:06,700
She says, "darling,

558
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
I think it's time
you took a rest. "

559
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,400
I say, "I'm gonna.
We're gonna take a vacation. "

560
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,665
She says,
"that's not what I meant.

561
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,800
I don't wanna be the
wealthiest widow on Long Island.

562
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,600
I Want you to quit now. "

563
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm not ashamed to say
that she made me cry.

564
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:25,500
That wonderful loving woman.

565
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,200
That dream with my father,
the empty box-

566
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,550
It wasn't about being boss.

567
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:36,800
It was about being happy.

568
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,200
Warren, hi.

569
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,965
Hi, hon.
How's he doing?

570
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,900
Listen, I've been meaning to
talk to you about the smoking.

571
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,400
John shared with me
how upset you were.

572
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,300
Psychologically, when a
person's told they're dying,

573
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,300
It's the ultimate
loss of control.

574
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,300
To hear him wheeze
like that...

575
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,600
I Know.
It doesn't make any sense.

576
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,865
I do know he's a leader.

577
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,400
I suspect his smoking
on some level

578
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Is an attempt
to die as he lived-

579
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,800
In total control.

580
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,000
Years ago, I asked him
to stop for me and the kids.

581
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,200
I lost 27 Ibs.
He couldn't quit smoking?

582
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,600
I gotta go.

583
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,100
Goodbye, Caitlin.
I'll see you soon, muffin.

584
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,400
Oh my god.
I love these little hands.

585
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,400
Thanks so much
for watching her.

586
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,700
You'd think we're planning a
coronation instead of a christening.

587
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,000
- We all set?
- You know what? I'd better pee.

588
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,400
Goody, I get
to keep holding you.

589
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,900
So how you doing? Tony said you
got an offer on the house you built.

590
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,300
Two, actually, yes.

591
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:07,700
Ivana Trump.

592
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I gotta be honest. I am very
disappointed at what you did.

593
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:16,800
- What are you talking about?
- Your movie.

594
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,200
The boss sleeping with the
other guy's fiancee?

595
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,800
- What?
- Please, like that wasn't based on Tony and Ade.

596
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,765
What? No.

597
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,200
Carmela, I didn't
even write it.

598
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,365
Story by
Christopher Moltisanti.

599
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Isn't that what it said
up there on the screen?

600
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Yeah, but that's just for the
Writers Guild health insurance.

601
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:36,200
- Oh, really?
- Come on, you can't be serious.

602
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,700
She's an oriental,
for Christ sake.

603
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,700
Have you heard
from Ade lately?

604
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,600
No, why would I hear from her?

605
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,200
Would it be so surprising?

606
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
She left me for some other guy.

607
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Is it any wonder?

608
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,700
Her poor mother is so upset,
she's practically delusional.

609
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,000
She's convinced herself
that Ade is dead.

610
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,200
Her mother's an alky.
You know that.

611
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,800
Regardless, Christopher.

612
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,150
You're my cousin,
and I love you, Carmela,

613
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:04,400
But I don't like what
you're inferring here,

614
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,900
Either with the movie
or how I treated Adriana.

615
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,300
Kelli comes out,
tell her I went to smoke.

616
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,000
There's my pal.
How you doing?

617
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,900
"Billy Bathgate. "
they had it in the library.

618
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,900
I thought of you.

619
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,500
I don't know if you heard,
but Gerry Torciano,

620
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,300
He was hit last week
in Brooklyn.

621
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,900
- Who?
- Gerry Torciano.

622
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It was all over the news.

623
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,300
They whacked him
in some restaurant.

624
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
Did you know him?

625
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Yeah.

626
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I don't know.
Good guy.

627
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,900
It's hard to breathe.

628
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,265
I'll talk to Gupte,

629
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,000
See if I can get him
to up the beclovent.

630
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,700
I'm dying, aren't I?

631
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,400
It's not good.

632
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I Won't lie to you.

633
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,200
The aggressiveness
surprises me.

634
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,100
I gotta concur with Rosen.

635
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,300
I Appreciate everything
you've done, Warren.

636
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,000
- Who is it?
- You don't answer your phone?

637
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I shut the ringer.
It's the middle of the night.

638
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,900
Honey, what's wrong?

639
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,400
Nothing, sweetie, it's
fine. Go back to sleep.

640
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:05,200
It ain't fine.
We got a problem.

641
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,700
That whole sequence with
Sally boy banging the fiancee,

642
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,300
You gotta tell Tony
that was your idea.

643
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,265
It wasn't my idea.

644
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,900
What, are you fucking stupid he probably
thinks I put it in there to embarrass him.

645
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,500
- Why did you put it in there?
- It was an idea.

646
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,165
I don't know. Who knows
where they fucking come from?

647
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Isaac Newton invented gravity 'cause
some asshole hit him with an apple.

648
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,800
It's bad enough that I don't
get credit for my own ideas.

649
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,000
Now I'm supposed to take responsibility for
some shit that's gonna get me in trouble?

650
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Fuck that, man.

651
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,500
Humanitas Award.
What's that?

652
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,700
Humanitas.
From the Paulist Brothers,

653
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,700
For writing themes
of socially redeeming-

654
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,965
Ow!

655
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,800
Look out the window. You see a
fucking Hollywood sign out there?

656
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,865
Maybe you talk
to your agent like that,

657
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,500
But don't ever get fucking
snippy on me again.

658
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,300
The fucking scary thing was
I didn't know what happened

659
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,100
Till after the shot was fired.

660
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:13,200
Fucking weird.

661
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
- Tony, hey. Gentlemen.
- Hey, how are you?

662
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,300
T.J. Hooker.

663
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,300
J.T., actually, but uhm

664
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:23,200
I'm looking for Chris.

665
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,100
I'm supposed to meet him.

666
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
What, here?

667
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,500
The thing is
he left me a message,

668
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:32,500
But this fucking verizon-

669
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,900
- Mind if I wait?
- Yeah, sit down.

670
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,100
- Diet coke, please.
- You got it.

671
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,900
So what did you think
of "cleaver"?

672
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,100
It's good, you know.

673
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,700
Congratulations.

674
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,400
I hope we're gonna see
some money soon.

675
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah.

676
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,365
As a writer, you can
never tell, you know?

677
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,600
You come up with an idea. You don't
know how the audience is gonna respond.

678
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,600
I mean, just 'cause I like
something, I think of

679
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Doesn't mean
anyone else will.

680
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,465
That's the challenge.

681
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,600
It is challenging sometimes,

682
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,100
Inventing characters,
how they interact.

683
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,400
The boss Sally boy
for example,

684
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,900
His whole persona-

685
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
I stole that from Broderick
Crawford in "Born Yesterday. "

686
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,700
What's that?

687
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,300
Garson Kanin, 1950.
It's terrific.

688
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,200
William Holden falls in love with
Crawford's girlfiend, played by Judy Holiday

689
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:29,500
The black girl,
the singer.

690
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,200
No, that's Billie Holiday.

691
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,000
Although Judy's character
in the movie

692
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,600
Is named Billie too, so I
can see why you're confused.

693
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,800
I've never seen it.
Why would I be confused?

694
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,500
Anyway, the Sally boy character

695
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,165
Is based on Crawford-
sort of a big, burly guy.

696
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,800
The love triangle, the cuckolding of
Michael, sleeping with the fiancee,

697
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,000
Very similar to
the Holden-Holliday dynamic.

698
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
- So the whole thing was your idea.
- Apologies to Garcon Kanin.

699
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
- What happened to your head?
- What?

700
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh. Cabinet.

701
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,400
Duh.

702
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,500
If I see Chrissy, I'll tell
him you were looking for him.

703
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Now listen to me, you two heels.
I mean business.

704
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,600
I got too much at stake down here.
You got somthing that belongs to me.

705
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,800
If you wanna get out of here alive,
you better give it back.

706
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,700
Now I'm no blowhard.
Tell him.

707
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,300
He's no blowhard.
He's had people killed before.

708
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,000
- About six years ago, there
was this guy- - shut up!

709
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,200
You ain't gonna be telling
nobody nothing pretty soon.

710
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
This is the image of me
he leaves to the world.

711
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,400
I remember when he was born,
I would hold him in my arms.

712
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,600
He was an adorable kid, too.

713
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,100
Big eyes.

714
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,700
You always talk about him

715
00:45:15,735 --> 00:45:17,667
More like a son.

716
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:19,565
In some ways he was,

717
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,200
Especially after his dad died.

718
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,200
When he was little,
I used to give him rides.

719
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,500
I'd put him in the basket
of the butcher bike,

720
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,800
Pedal him around,

721
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,700
Back when Satriale's
made deliveries.

722
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:35,300
I reminded him
of that recently.

723
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,300
- He didn't remember.
- But you do.

724
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:41,300
We had fun.

725
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,300
All those memories,
and for what?

726
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
All I am to him
is some asshole bully.

727
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,300
You're hurt.

728
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,900
His dad Dickie was

729
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,400
Like my me to him.

730
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,800
A mentor.

731
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Yeah, but more than that,

732
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,765
A friend,

733
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
A fucking guy
you could look up to.

734
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,900
And the hope is that
you pass that shit down,

735
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,400
The respect and the love.

736
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,400
And all I did
for this fucking kid

737
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
And he fucking hates me
so much.

738
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,400
I'm sure on some level
he loves you, too.

739
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,200
Yeah?

740
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,200
Take that home.
Judge for yourself.

741
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,500
Last five minutes should
answer that question.

742
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,300
I'm not going to do that.

743
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,300
- Not a horror fan?
- It's what you think that matters.

744
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,200
I think he fucking despises me.
It's pretty obvious.

745
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,800
Wants to see me dead.

746
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,500
Without invalidating
your feelings,

747
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,300
Is it possible that
on some level

748
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:11,500
You're reading into all this?

749
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,765
I'Ve been coming here for years.

750
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,500
I know too much about
the subconscious now.

751
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,865
Look, sweetie,

752
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,700
They're nice and clean
like you like them.

753
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,200
Mommy, he can't really hear you.

754
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:46,600
They're right here by the bed.

755
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,700
- My...
- What, baby, your what?

756
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,600
Want more morphine, daddy?

757
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,500
Mo- mother.

758
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,300
Grandma? What, daddy?

759
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,800
Is he hallucinating?

760
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,600
I don't know. He could be.

761
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,200
Sometimes they see
people who've passed.

762
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,800
John, look at me, baby.

763
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,100
You want a cigarette, baby?
John?

764
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,800
You can't do that when
you're on my fucking team?

765
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,100
Hey, Ton',
Anthony Infante to see you

766
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,500
Send him in.

767
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
There he is.
X- ray specs.

768
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,600
- How's John?
- That's why I'm here, Tony.

769
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,300
John passed away
late this morning.

770
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,800
Oh, fuck,
you're kidding me.

771
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,600
I only wish.

772
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,700
He was a great guy, John.
Sorry for your loss.

773
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,400
Thanks. Honestly, though,
it was for the best.

774
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,400
What are you gonna do?

775
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,700
"I beat cancer,
but it took him out. "

776
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,200
"Ride the painted pony.
Let the spinning wheel fly. "

777
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:37,800
Huh?

778
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,900
John Sacrimoni,
a buon' anima.

779
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
A buon' anima.

780
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,300
We're here to celebrate
what would have been my brother's-

781
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,865
Your uncle's-
47th birthday.

782
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,700
Blow it out for him.

783
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,665
Right here at this bar,
this seat

784
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,200
Was uncle Billy's favorite
place in the whole world.

785
00:50:11,235 --> 00:50:13,100
More than Shea stadium?

786
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,700
More than Shea stadium.

787
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,050
He'd sit with his friends and
tell stories about his family,

788
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:21,300
Who he loved more than anything
and was so very proud of.

789
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,365
From now on, his ashes
will be right here

790
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,500
So when his friends come
to visit, he can see them.

791
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,400
- Can he see us now?
- Yeah.

792
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,900
- Who knows who is Leonardo Da Vinci?
- I do.

793
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,565
- Matty.
- Yeah, he wrote "The Da Vinci Code. "

794
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,400
Another man wrote that, but
it's a hideous sacrilegious book.

795
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,800
- Annabella.
- He was a painter,

796
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:50,465
Of the "Mona Lisa. "

797
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,000
Very good. He was not only a
painter, he did medical drawings,

798
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,900
- And he designed a tank for the army.
- Wow.

799
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,900
Leonardo was a great italian,

800
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,100
And that was our name
originally, Leonardo.

801
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,500
But many years ago, when my
grandpa came over from Sicily,

802
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,600
They changed it at
Ellis Island to Leotardo.

803
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,200
What did they do that for?

804
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,600
Because they're stupid,
that's why, and jealous.

805
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,500
They disrespected
a proud italian heritage

806
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,300
And named us
after a ballet costume.

807
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,600
- Marissa.
- That's for modern. In ballet, you wear tutus.

808
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:25,600
It doesn't make a difference.

809
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,100
- That's right, it doesn't.
- Can we have cake now?

810
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,600
How you doing, Phil?

811
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,800
You okay?

812
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,500
47-
He was a fucking kid.

813
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,400
Me, I'm an old man.

814
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,400
I'd like to do it over, boy.
Let me tell you.

815
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
I fucking compromised
everything.

816
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,100
Nah, what are you
talking about?

817
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,950
20 years inside,

818
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:29,700
Not a fucking peep.

819
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,900
For what?
To protect the likes

820
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,300
Of Rusty fucking Millio,
Doc Santoro?

821
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,000
You were a man, Phil.
That's saying a lot nowadays.

822
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,300
That cocksucking piece of shit
Tony Soprano's cousin-

823
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,000
I can't even
say his name-

824
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,100
Murdered Billie.
And what did I do about it?

825
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,500
My weakness.

826
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,400
Sometimes I think
it's in my DNA.

827
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
My family took shit
from the Medigans

828
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,865
The minute we got
off the boat.

829
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,200
Come on, what the fuck
you talking about?

830
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,765
Leotardo.

831
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
That's my fucking legacy.

832
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,600
No more, Butchie.

833
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,800
No more of this.
