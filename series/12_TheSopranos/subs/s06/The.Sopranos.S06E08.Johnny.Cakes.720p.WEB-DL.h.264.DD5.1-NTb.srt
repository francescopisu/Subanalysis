1
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,070
Are you all right?

2
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,940
Yeah!

3
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,050
Keep going!

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,660
Are you sure
you're all right?

5
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,990
The incision?

6
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,000
You're listening
to the stations

7
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,040
of member-supported
New Hampshire Public Radio.

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,440
We're WEBO, Concord 89.1;

9
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,280
WEBJ, Jackson 99.5 F.M.

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,420
This is New Hampshire
Public Radio,

11
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,110
news and information
for the Granite State.

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,660
It's nice
having this again.

13
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,490
Well, it's supposed
to be better than "nice."

14
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,610
You know what I mean.

15
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,180
After that nightmare,
God, we are blessed, Tony.

16
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah.

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,150
AJ's practicing?

18
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,450
That's a first.

19
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,170
I'll let you know.

20
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,070
- All right.
- All right, thanks, man.

21
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,210
Your amigos
with the baggy pants--

22
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,210
hope you kept 'em
away from the silver.

23
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,410
Oh, Jesus,
they're musicians, all right?

24
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,850
They saw an ad
for the drums.

25
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,850
You're selling
your drums?

26
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,220
I need cash.
I don't play 'em anymore.

27
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,550
Those drums were a gift
from your father.

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,390
Yeah, I don't
wanna sell 'em.

29
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,720
And if you guys hadn't made me
get such a crappy job,

30
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,890
- I wouldn't have to.
- This is our fault?

31
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm wasting my time
at Blockbuster.

32
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,330
Why don't you get off your ass
and find another job?

33
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,470
What about community college? You said
you were gonna go back to school.

34
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,700
Okay, for the
hundredth time:

35
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,680
I can't register
until second semester!

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,140
- Oh!
- Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,580
I do what you
guys want,

38
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,950
don't I deserve
some kind of life?

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,530
Please, move back!
Move back!

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,240
Jim, we need a crew
on the roof to ventilate. Let's go!

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,510
I can't find Gareth.
I think he's still in the house.

42
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,750
<i>- Titta!
- FÃ¶nstret!</i>

43
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:40,050
<i>- Jag har det!
- Ã…h, herre gud!</i>

44
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,990
- It'll be all right, Sarah.
- Come on, guys, go go go!

45
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,420
Hurry up!
Come on.

46
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,390
- Look, look!
- That window!

47
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,790
- I got him!
- Oh-- oh God!

48
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,330
I got her kid.

49
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,300
All right, whoo!

50
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,280
You want another one?

51
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,420
Yeah, sure.

52
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,950
So Uncle Jun'--

53
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,510
what are we gonna do
about him?

54
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,850
He's incarcerated
for the rest of his unnatural life.

55
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,790
So fuck him.

56
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,050
He's a walking corpse.

57
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,320
Yeah, but, Dad,
what he did to you--

58
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,630
Certainly nothing
for you to worry about.

59
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,210
"Manager Dale."
Welcome to the neighborhood.

60
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,210
We're from the North Ward
Merchants Protective Cooperative.

61
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm kinda busy.
You guys looking for a donation?

62
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,750
- Let him finish.
- You may have noticed,

63
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,580
not to denigrate anyone,
but this is a transitional neighborhood.

64
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,990
I mean, demographically speaking,
you still have a lot of marginal types.

65
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,790
We merchants have found
you really should

66
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,260
have some round-the-clock
security here.

67
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,100
- Isn't that what the police are for?
- They do their best,

68
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,830
but they got
their hands full.

69
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,340
Your weekly dues to us will give you
all the supplemental

70
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,440
- safety net you'll ever need.
- I can't authorize anything like that.

71
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,580
It have to go through
Corporate in Seattle.

72
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,610
We merchants prefer
to deal on a personal one-on-one basis.

73
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,680
I don't have any
discretionary funds.

74
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,340
It's gotta go
through Corporate.

75
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,580
How do you think Corporate
would feel if--

76
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,990
for the sake of argument, someone threw
a brick through your window?

77
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,180
They've got 10,000 stores
in North America.

78
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
I don't think
they'd feel anything.

79
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,600
What if, God forbid,
it wasn't just vandalism?

80
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,900
What if an employee,

81
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,630
even the manager say,
was assaulted?

82
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,610
Look, every last
fucking coffee bean

83
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,040
is in the computer
and has to be accounted for.

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,450
The numbers don't add up, I'll be gone
and somebody else will be here.

85
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,590
It's over
for the little guy.

86
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,660
Vince, good morning.
How's your book coming?

87
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,630
Okay.

88
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,930
You're always welcome
to join the other guests for breakfast.

89
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,700
Thad says if your dishwasher
is newer than five years,

90
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,740
you don't need to use
the pre-rinse cycle.

91
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,410
The fact is I don't recommend it.
It can trick the sensors

92
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,680
into thinking that the dishes
are cleaner than they really are.

93
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,690
I gotta go write.
Thanks.

94
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,720
Morning.

95
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,500
Jason Masucci was down in Tampa
visiting his mother,

96
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,940
thought he saw Vito
in a Jenny Craig.

97
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,520
Turned out to be
some other fat piece of shit.

98
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,710
If that fag ever
does come back,

99
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,310
we should have
Carlo do it.

100
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,890
Be good
with all the crews.

101
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,030
Excuse me?
You were all hot to trot.

102
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,290
I got enough complications
in my life.

103
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,290
Feds up my ass.

104
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,300
For business reasons,
okay,

105
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
but for political
correctness?

106
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,370
Ooh, check it out.

107
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,440
I could do that,
no problem.

108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,270
Wait here.
I'll get your Viagra.

109
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,780
Let me tell you something,
for two months after the shooting,

110
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,810
as far as snatch
was concerned,

111
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,280
didn't even have a hard-on
when I woke up in the morning.

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,150
Like Sil.

113
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,950
Bullet didn't fuck
with the plumbing though.

114
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,880
No no, thank God.

115
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,050
It's just the effects
of the physical trauma.

116
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,320
Doc said it was part
of the healing process.

117
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,830
I must be healed now
because I got a baguette

118
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,990
in my pants now 24/7.

119
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,500
Affirmation of life.

120
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,100
Hey, she's coming
this way.

121
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,940
Put money in the meter
or something.

122
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,440
Anthony Soprano.

123
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,910
- Yeah.
- Julianna Skiff,

124
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,680
Century 21.
You got a minute?

125
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Sure.

126
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,320
Cannoli?

127
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,620
No, thank you.

128
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,690
You own the building at 217 Franklin,
right around the corner,

129
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,260
currently occupied
by Caputo Live Poultry.

130
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,130
I represent
the Jamba Juice Company.

131
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,460
They're interested
in purchasing the property.

132
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,500
Jamba Juice...

133
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,700
wants to put a store
in around here?

134
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,360
Well, you must have
noticed the area's on an upswing.

135
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,600
You know the old glove factory
across the park,

136
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,940
over by the cathedral,
beautiful renovation.

137
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,950
I just bought
a loft there myself.

138
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,450
Person like yourself's a wonderful
addition to the neighborhood.

139
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,250
Jamba Juice is willing
to pay $175 a square foot.

140
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,420
Public records show
the building at 1,800 square feet.

141
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,860
So that makes
a purchase price of $315,000.

142
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,160
You ever buy eggs
from Caputo?

143
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,130
Frankly, I'm not wild
about the smell in there.

144
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,600
Let me tell ya, his eggs
taste 10 times better

145
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,140
than any of the ones you get
in the supermarket. Chickens too.

146
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,470
Businesses relocate
all the time.

147
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,810
No, this would be a real loss
for the neighborhood.

148
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,880
Don't you live out
in North Caldwell?

149
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,420
Yeah, my family made
the trek up Guinea Gulch.

150
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,420
Bloomfield Avenue.

151
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,990
But my roots here
go way back.

152
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,130
My grandfather
came from Avellino

153
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,990
like most of the people around here,
and I grew up right over there.

154
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,430
My father was an early
community leader.

155
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,190
Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,010
How about you?
Where're you from?

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,660
Upstate New York.

158
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,610
- Binghamton.
- How'd you wind up here?

159
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,110
My parents have
a catering business,

160
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,150
something to leave
to the kids, right?

161
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,550
Only I didn't see myself making
Salisbury steak for the next 30 years.

162
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,550
So I left home at 17.

163
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,090
- Rebellious.
- Just a low tolerance for boredom.

164
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,450
So-- interested,
not interested?

165
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm interested.

166
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,470
But as far as
the property's concerned,

167
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,730
175 a square foot's
a little low.

168
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,370
And...

169
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,480
I don't wanna sell out
from under the guy.

170
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,850
Good morning, Vince.

171
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,050
The usual?

172
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,490
- Been dreaming of those johnnycakes.
- Can't beat Jim's johnnycakes.

173
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,630
I saw you at
the fire last night.

174
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,630
You got balls, my friend.

175
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,570
You don't get paid
for that, right?

176
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,640
We're all volunteers.

177
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,930
Back where I come from,
you join the fire department

178
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,940
to steal shit
from people's bedrooms.

179
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,770
- How's the book coming?
- It's fucking slow today.

180
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,210
Writer's block, huh?

181
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,310
Let's just say I like eating
a lot more than writing.

182
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,310
And you don't help any.

183
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,820
Everything you make
is fucking delicious.

184
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,320
You know...

185
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,580
I don't know
how you do it.

186
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,590
I can't even
write a letter.

187
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,090
I saw Graziano
fight Sugar Ray in 1952.

188
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,030
I took a train
to Chicago.

189
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,070
Maybe you should
interview me.

190
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,790
Maybe I will.

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,560
I thought you were writing a book
about Rocky Marciano.

192
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,270
Well, you can't talk about one
without the other.

193
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,110
Marciano--

194
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,440
now that was
a tragic death.

195
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,980
Now what was the year
he fought Joe Louis-- '49?

196
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,310
Yeah.

197
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,220
Actually, I think
it was '51.

198
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,360
When you told me
you were writing a book,

199
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,330
I looked him up
on the Internet.

200
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,660
I don't know where
my fucking head is today.

201
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,530
Maybe you're working
too hard.

202
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,530
Yeah.

203
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,730
It must be lonely sometimes--
being a writer.

204
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,210
You get used to it.

205
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,400
Hey, Dad, I left
my science project in the back.

206
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,310
Don't lose
my glue gun.

207
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,330
Hey, Mrs. Conte.
Come sta'?

208
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,760
- How's the hip?
- Hey, Anthony. I need your help.

209
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,860
- What?
- Those nigger fucking whores,

210
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,860
they play that
music so loud.

211
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,330
Now that's not nice.
Those are Puerto Ricans, Mrs. Conte.

212
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,340
I ask 'em nice
to turn it down.

213
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,700
They tell me
to go fuck myself.

214
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,380
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

215
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,040
Hey, how's Junior?

216
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,620
- Tell him I said hello.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,430
You know, I been
meaning to ask you,

218
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,470
chicken or the egg?
You wanna weigh in?

219
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,300
That same stupid joke,
huh?

220
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,310
- How are you?
- Good good.

221
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,210
So how's business?
Mezzo mezz'?

222
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,140
- Believe it or not, better than ever.
- Glad to hear it.

223
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,220
I'll have to raise
your rent.

224
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,710
See, when you hold
your knife with your blade

225
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,020
facing your opponent,
you got a lot better control.

226
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,790
Plus, you protect
the forearm.

227
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,460
No, if you got the tip pointing at him,
you get more distance.

228
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,500
You could swipe his abdomen
and fucking gut him.

229
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,470
See, that's stupid. Look how your range
of motion is limited.

230
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,160
It's so easy for him to step back,
grab your fucking arm,

231
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,930
- take your knife away.
- Could someone please check us out?

232
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,210
Yo, Hernan.

233
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,650
Sure, what time?

234
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,020
Cool.

235
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,020
No problem.
I can cover tonight.

236
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,630
I'm totally
fucking minted. Later.

237
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,660
Yeah?

238
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,930
I'm at work.
What do you think?

239
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,860
He stepped on a nail?

240
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
Fuck.

241
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,800
How far did it
go in?

242
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,970
- Fuck!
- Would you mind?

243
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,940
I better call
you back. Bye.

244
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,380
That was Hernan?

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,850
He was such a dick
in high school.

246
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,220
Well, he was a senior.
What do you expect?

247
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,650
They always shit
on the underclassmen.

248
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,790
The kid spends
every night

249
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,950
in some fucking club
in New York,

250
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,000
sleeps till noon, puts in a couple
hours at Blockbuster

251
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,360
and that's it.

252
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,900
And since my injury,
like I told you,

253
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,640
I've been more,
you know...

254
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
accepting. Be grateful
for what you got.

255
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,140
But maybe that's wrong.
Maybe I should be on the kid.

256
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,690
My dad would have
kicked my lazy ass out of the house.

257
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,320
Really?

258
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,690
It's the chopping off
of the guy's finger, right?

259
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,920
I never should have told you 'cause
that's all you fixate on with him.

260
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,730
Can you empathize
with AJ at that age?

261
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,270
Yeah, I had some
problems at school,

262
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,500
but I didn't vegetate.

263
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,940
- What?
- These are different times.

264
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,980
People today are bombarded
with so much information,

265
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,210
so much input
of every kind.

266
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,380
Consequently,
true adulthood

267
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,920
is delayed.

268
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,390
Sociologists say
that 26

269
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,050
is in fact
the new 21.

270
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,200
And the new 26
is what?

271
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm 46, so that means
I'm what, 35?

272
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,140
My father isn't
an old man.

273
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,970
It's ridiculous to let himself
disintegrate like this.

274
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,250
How's it going
with patient Soprano?

275
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,750
- What?
- I'm talking about my father, Elliot.

276
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,480
- I thought you were done.
- It happens too often.

277
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,760
I think that's
a non-sequitur accusation.

278
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,700
Why don't you just
admit he's a gangster?

279
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,530
He was gunned down,
and you're into it

280
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,070
on a tabloid level.

281
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
You devoted quite a chunk
of last visit to him.

282
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm responding to that.

283
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,180
Nothing's changed, okay?

284
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,280
He refuses to really engage
on this trauma the uncle caused.

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,250
And I think it's just
a matter of time

286
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,790
before he totally
decompensates.

287
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,860
Has he cried
or reported crying

288
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,960
at all about
this man Buster?

289
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,000
Junior, no.

290
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,100
Hmm.

291
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,900
This omerta concept

292
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,300
comes from
a pre-therapeutic culture.

293
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,310
This isn't omerta.

294
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,950
It's something else.

295
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,660
Hey, man...
park it in the garage

296
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,770
on 14th Street,
not the other shithole.

297
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,340
Watch for potholes.

298
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,270
What's going on, man?

299
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,910
How's it going?
Good to see you.

300
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,250
His dad's
really a gangster?

301
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,910
Capo di tutti capi.

302
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,920
What's that mean?

303
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
- How old are you?
- 20.

304
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,090
- Shut up.
- 15.

305
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,390
- How old are you?
- 18.

306
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,370
When I take E,
my feet get cold.

307
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,370
That ever happen
to you?

308
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,970
I wear special socks.

309
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,610
Let's go uptown
to my crib and get more twisted,

310
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,300
if that's possible.

311
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,910
- Oh, it's possible.
- I could give you a massage.

312
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,110
Yeah. Yeah, you could.

313
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,180
Oh, yeah, all right.

314
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,350
We all good?

315
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,460
Yeah, it's cool.

316
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,840
Mr. Soprano,
Zasu said to tell you

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,950
he's honored to
have you in the club.

318
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,550
And please,
regards to your dad.

319
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,980
Okay.

320
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,160
Oh, yeah, right.

321
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,330
What can I do
for you, Phil?

322
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,900
Vito.

323
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,440
Do we know
where he's at?

324
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,010
Well, that really
doesn't concern you.

325
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,730
How's John?

326
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,940
I don't know. Fine,
through his vale of tears.

327
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,750
But seriously, Vito, what's being
done about him?

328
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,080
Like I just said, it's none of your
fucking business

329
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,920
- 'cause he works for me, not you.
- He's married to my cousin.

330
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,290
He dishonored me
personally.

331
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,450
What do you want me to do,
put out an APB on the guy

332
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,430
'cause he takes it
up the ass, huh?

333
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,590
It's a victimless crime.

334
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Marie is a victim.
Her children are victims.

335
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,340
They've done nothing.

336
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,370
And they're forced
to live with the shame

337
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,940
and humiliation.
I gotta be frank,

338
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,740
in your father's day,

339
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,380
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

340
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,610
A finook in his crew,
he knew how to handle that.

341
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,050
I sympathize with Marie

342
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,090
and the children, okay?

343
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,720
But don't you fucking tell me what
to do. You're only acting boss.

344
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,190
I swallowed my pride
when your murdering fuck of a cousin

345
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,230
killed my brother.

346
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,990
Don't think I'm
gonna do it twice.

347
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,600
Phillip, let's not make a beef
where there isn't one.

348
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,300
Fundamentally,
we are in agreement

349
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,570
on this issue,
but I'll handle it.

350
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,820
You know, I saw you on TV
when your grandfather shot your dad.

351
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,720
And now we're
like friends.

352
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,750
- That's so weird.
- Right.

353
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,390
So what's gonna happen
to him, your grandfather, I mean?

354
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,220
He's my great-uncle.

355
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,060
So isn't your dad
gonna do something?

356
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,930
You know, the "omerto"?

357
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,530
We don't talk about that
with outsiders.

358
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,690
Cool, but I mean,

359
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,340
he's not just gonna
let him get away with it, is he?

360
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll probably
have to do something.

361
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,040
Really?

362
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,340
You're so intense.

363
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,240
You probably left it
in the car, Thad.

364
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,180
No, it was
on the bedside table.

365
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,190
- I was charging it.
- You're always losing something.

366
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,190
Last week it was
the sunglasses.

367
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,990
He left them on the counter
at the TCBY.

368
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,500
- What did you lose?
- Cell phone.

369
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,140
I didn't lose it.
I was charging the damn thing.

370
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,770
Tell you what I do--
try to retrace my steps.

371
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,880
It was
on the bedside table.

372
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,280
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

373
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,910
- Where are you? Who's Thad McCone?
- Some guy.

374
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,320
- Oh, my God, Vito.
- Not that.

375
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,050
I'm just borrowing
his phone.

376
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,220
Listen, Marie,

377
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,990
I'm sorry all this
had to happen.

378
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,500
I never meant
to hurt you.

379
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,030
Come back, Vito.
Just come back.

380
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
It's a little more
complicated than that.

381
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,730
Please, Phil said
it'll be all right.

382
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,170
We could get you help.
We could get you psychiatric help.

383
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,970
Phil? I trust him
least of all.

384
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,410
How can you say that?
He's family.

385
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,520
- He loves you.
- Not anymore, believe me.

386
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,550
But I've been
reading online,

387
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,590
there are these
church groups.

388
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,250
They could cure you
of this.

389
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,920
- Marie--
- Well, what are you gonna do,

390
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,500
never come home?

391
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm working on that.

392
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,830
In the meantime,
you're gonna need some cash.

393
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,230
I need you, Vito.
I need my husband.

394
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Listen to me, in the den behind
the elliptical trainer,

395
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,740
the baseboard
comes off.

396
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,640
There's 30K in there.

397
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,250
You know, Marie,

398
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,890
- you would like it here.
- Tell me where.

399
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,190
I'll bring the kids.
We'll relocate.

400
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,050
I gotta go.

401
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,390
Don't you wanna talk
to Frannie or little V?

402
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,460
Yeah, okay.

403
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,160
Put 'em on.

404
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,070
Vito, your father's
on the phone.

405
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,270
He wants to talk to you.

406
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,010
Hi, Dad.

407
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,740
Hey there, champ,
you been good?

408
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
You been behaving?

409
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,850
Yeah, you know...

410
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,420
- Dad?
- I gotta go.

411
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,790
You take care
of your mother, okay?

412
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,410
Mr. Soprano.

413
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,520
- Hey.
- Hi.

414
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,520
- Good news.
- How'd you know to find me here?

415
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm a real estate agent.

416
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,890
Uh-oh.

417
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,900
Can I buy you
a drink?

418
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,470
Uh, sure.

419
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,630
Ginger ale with
lime juice, please.

420
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,830
Have a seat.

421
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,410
Jamba Juice upped
their offer--

422
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,410
225 a square foot.

423
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,110
I don't know.

424
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,050
How's this for an idea?

425
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,050
They let you
carry the note.

426
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,050
You won't get hammered
on the taxes.

427
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,060
Well,
that's an incentive,

428
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,320
but the truth is
I don't wanna sell.

429
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,330
You're a businessman,
are you not?

430
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,330
As a businessman,
I gotta tell you

431
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,800
that in 10 years' time
that property's gonna

432
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,600
be worth twice as much
as they're offering.

433
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,500
But, you know, it's not
just the money.

434
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,970
You drive around America today
and everything looks the fucking same--

435
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,240
Old Navy and Bed, Bath
and whatever.

436
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,710
But the North Ward,
it's the North Ward.

437
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,610
Plus, I got business
interests there, so...

438
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,260
Something like all immigrant groups
love to gamble.

439
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,350
Listen, why don't...

440
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,290
me and you go get
some dinner?

441
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,060
I have a boyfriend.

442
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm engaged.

443
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,000
I have a wife.
I'm married.

444
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,330
It's... you know,
we're talking business.

445
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,370
You just said you don't wanna sell.
What's there to discuss?

446
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,270
Truth is I'm
very attracted to you.

447
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,140
Maybe you read in the papers
that I got shot.

448
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,840
Well, Julianna,

449
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,820
that experience made
me appreciate life.

450
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,790
It's short. It could
end at any time,

451
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,620
and if you've got
the chance to do something

452
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,990
that might make you happy,

453
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,690
you should take it,

454
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,240
you know, like when
you left Binghamton.

455
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,050
You're very persuasive.

456
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,050
And in the past,
I might have jumped.

457
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,980
Like I said,
I'm engaged.

458
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,180
And things
are going well.

459
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,620
I think for once
in my life,

460
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,290
I will exercise
a little self-control.

461
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
Thanks for the drink.

462
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,890
Guy sent this over.

463
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,460
I saw that guy
in the field the other day.

464
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,490
When we were
practicing dummy drag,

465
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,890
he spent the whole time
in the bleachers staring.

466
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah?
Vince, come here.

467
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,230
Join us.

468
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,770
He's a very funny guy.
Great sense of humor.

469
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,530
- Thanks for this.
- Thanks.

470
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,770
My pleasure.

471
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,970
We were talking about
a call we had last month.

472
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,310
- We were lucky the roof held.
- Did anyone hear that Yma Sumac scream

473
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,480
when the ceiling fan
came down? That was Ron.

474
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
The goddamn thing
almost killed me.

475
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,090
You would have
screamed too, you cunt.

476
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,490
Fucking nancies.
Don't argue now.

477
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,460
You know, guys, we've got to get serious
about the state muster next month.

478
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,430
Last year Hinsdale
whipped our butt in that ladder carry.

479
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,660
- What's that, a Deuce?
- Fat Boy.

480
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,670
Chromed out the forks.

481
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,210
- Nice.
- You ride?

482
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,940
I always wanted a Panhead.
Never happened.

483
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,110
You should get a bike.

484
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,120
Out here when the leaves
are changing,

485
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,310
blasting down
the Daniel Webster Highway,

486
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,120
- there's nothing else like it.
- Yeah.

487
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,950
I bet.

488
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,530
You know,
I'm glad you decided

489
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,960
to write your book
in our little town.

490
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,470
What the fuck you doing?
What are you, some kind of fag?

491
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,870
- Guess I made a mistake.
- You sure as fuck did.

492
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,140
Listen, closet queen, you can't handle
it-- don't sent out the signals.

493
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,030
Dirty fighter, huh?

494
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,970
Asshole.

495
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
See that?
You didn't even notice.

496
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,060
What?

497
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,060
That salami--

498
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,060
40% less fat
and sodium.

499
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,170
You know...

500
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,090
you're always
looking out for me.

501
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,210
- I'm very lucky to have you.
- Mmm.

502
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,140
And don't you
forget it.

503
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,610
Hey, Prince Albert,
you know what time it is?

504
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,720
Huh?

505
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,020
These late nights
are getting to be

506
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,130
a real habit with you, AJ.
Don't you have to work today?

507
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,630
Look, I gotta
talk to you guys.

508
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,700
I need new clothes.
Everything I have is so old.

509
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,060
You got money.
You sold your drums.

510
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,530
And I need that money
for living expenses.

511
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,540
What do you think
clothes are?

512
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,300
No, I mean nice clothes,
not socks and underwear.

513
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,070
Oh, so you can go out
to the clubs with...

514
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,540
Fernando.
That kid is a creep.

515
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,150
Hernan. And he's not a creep.
He's my friend.

516
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,450
And I don't talk about
your friends that way.

517
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,490
When they were in school,
Hernan's mother and I

518
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,250
were on the faculty
lunch committee.

519
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,690
- Hernan has a reading disability.
- Fuck that.

520
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,620
And we're not giving you
any more money.

521
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,560
Frankly, AJ,
I am a little concerned--

522
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,560
the clubs, sleeping late,

523
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,670
your lack of interest
in anything productive.

524
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,670
Hey, I'm interested
in productive stuff,

525
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,670
just not stuff
you care about.

526
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,360
- I could run one of those clubs.
- What?

527
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,810
Look, I'm not just partying there.
I'm learning.

528
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,570
I see what works,
what doesn't.

529
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,340
I could have a great club,

530
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,180
and really successful.

531
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,250
If you guys care so much
about my future,

532
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,780
then why don't you
stake me?

533
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,050
In a club?
Get the hell out of here.

534
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,620
You pick up the garbage
in a lot of clubs in New York.

535
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,320
You know people. You could help me.
It's not like you can't

536
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,790
afford to set me up.
You have all the money in the world.

537
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,260
This is ridiculous.
Manage a club, AJ?

538
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,460
You've never even been
a busboy.

539
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,470
If you wanna get back
into event planning,

540
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,160
you should think about the Culinary
Institute in Poughkeepsie.

541
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,070
Culinary Institute? Why do you keep
talking about event planning?

542
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,710
I don't even know
what that is.

543
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,870
If you're serious,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

544
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,480
I'll get you a job at Beansie's

545
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,450
and you can learn the business
from the ground up.

546
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,180
That's a fucking pizza parlor,
not a club.

547
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,820
It's the service
industry!

548
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,650
Why are we even
having this discussion?

549
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,720
You're going back to college
next semester.

550
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,720
See? This is
just what I mean.

551
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,190
You guys never give me any support
in anything I wanna do.

552
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,190
- AJ!
- Oh!

553
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,530
God damn him.

554
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,390
This is fucking
demoralizing.

555
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,140
Maybe we should get him a club,
give him some responsibility.

556
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,040
Maybe he'll rise
to the occasion.

557
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,310
Are you insane?
He's not even legal drinking age.

558
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,420
Well, yeah yeah.

559
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,480
It's like a... bad smell
in the house.

560
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,820
It's always
hanging there.

561
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,120
More than that,
it's no good for me and Carmela.

562
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,430
'Cause arguing with AJ is no kind
of aphrodisiac, I'll tell you that.

563
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,170
Just when I was
beginning to feel

564
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,370
physically good again,
like my old self.

565
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,640
- Good. I see.
- But honestly, no one could blame a man

566
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,950
for seeking an extracurricular outlet
in a situation like this.

567
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,890
Don't give me that look.

568
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,080
You're always telling me
that I'm projecting.

569
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,750
You're projecting.

570
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,590
So you're not seeking
an extracurricular outlet?

571
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,500
No. I was just
being theoretical.

572
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,700
What Carmela did for me
when I was hurt,

573
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,470
the way
she took care of me,

574
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,700
nursed me back to health--
you think I wanna fucking betray that?

575
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,010
ls it possible
on some level

576
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,580
you blame her
for AJ's problems?

577
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,120
Look, I don't know.

578
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,010
No. Carmela's
a good mother.

579
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
She did her best.

580
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,060
Look, could you
just give me

581
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,060
some practical advice

582
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,070
for once?

583
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,800
Tell me what the fuck to do
about my son?

584
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,800
Well...

585
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,740
I think it's
entirely appropriate

586
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,810
for you and Carmela
to tell AJ.

587
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,640
you have certain
expectations of him,

588
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,110
particularly since he's
living in your home.

589
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,150
The most
important thing is

590
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,590
that you and Carmela
are in agreement

591
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,590
on the issues,

592
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,590
that you don't
undercut each other

593
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,230
or act at cross-purposes.

594
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,060
Here.
So you can buy a suit

595
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,570
to look nice for job
or college interviews.

596
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,730
This is not for fun.
This is not to be used

597
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,280
for any kind
of personal entertainment.

598
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,010
Thanks.

599
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,870
Hi.

600
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,000
Hey, Mr. Soprano.
What's going on?

601
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Welcome back.

602
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,670
Hey, what's up?
Meet my friends.

603
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,440
This is Farhad and...

604
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,240
- Daryl. What's up?
-... Daryl; AJ Soprano.

605
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,110
You know
Tommy Filippo?

606
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,880
- Providence?
- No, I don't think so.

607
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,420
Good friend of mine.
He's connected.

608
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,020
Farhad and Daryl
are starting a line of sports drinks.

609
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,550
- Cool.
- Big thing now.

610
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,420
Not just carbs-- protein.

611
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,360
When you exercise,
you drink four-to-one

612
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
carbohydrate-to-protein
solution--

613
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,830
decrease muscle damage,
increase endurance.

614
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,590
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- They're looking for investors.

615
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,430
- Maybe we can get you a prospectus, eh?
- Absolutely.

616
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,300
For your dad.
You can ask him to look at it.

617
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,700
Do you ever go to Lotus?
Good crowd on Wednesdays.

618
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,710
- I was there twice.
- I was there last week-- unbelievable.

619
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,490
Hey, wake me up
tomorrow, okay? 10:00?

620
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,820
We were just up
in Bradford.

621
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,730
There's a beautiful
long-truss bridge there.

622
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,160
Mmm. Right.

623
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,390
If you're interested
in covered bridges,

624
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,230
you need to get over
to Swanzey.

625
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,460
They have four marvelous
bridges there,

626
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,470
including a queen post.

627
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,630
Honey, we could
go tomorrow.

628
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,010
You know where else
you should go is Shaker Village.

629
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,840
You can't beat those
Shaker brooms.

630
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,040
Oh, I love old brooms!

631
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,990
AJ!

632
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,460
I woke you up two hours ago
like you asked me.

633
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,560
Now get up.

634
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,160
- Ouch.
- Carl, are you all right?

635
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,710
It is 4:00
in the afternoon.

636
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,370
You are not even dressed!

637
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,880
I got the impression
you had something important to do.

638
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,910
- There you go, Corrado.
- How come I don't get no mail?

639
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,910
Maybe you need
to write some letters,

640
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,240
start a correspondence.

641
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,440
Lying cocksucker!

642
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,850
They throw my mail out.

643
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,050
Your uncle is having dinner,
but you can see him now.

644
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,160
Warren will take you in.

645
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,170
This way.

646
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,740
Wait for me, please.

647
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,710
He's over here.

648
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,160
- Corrado, you have a visitor.
- What?

649
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,800
Anthony!
My nephew.

650
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,140
Take me home.
I wanna go home.

651
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,740
Knife!

652
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,710
That's not my knife.

653
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,640
Hey! Hey hey hey!

654
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,410
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Take it easy.

655
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,780
- He shot my dad!
- Relax.

656
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,890
- He shot my dad!
- Relax. Take it easy.

657
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,960
Uh, Anthony Soprano.

658
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,430
Yeah. I just talked
to Assemblyman Zellman.

659
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,540
Get him out of here.

660
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,550
My stomach hurts.

661
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,630
You stupid fucking moron. You realize
what could have happened to you

662
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,930
if we didn't have
connections?!

663
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,070
Some cop goes by the book
and they charge you

664
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,640
with attempted murder!
You hear me?

665
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,110
Attempted murder!
Then what? Then what?

666
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,650
He shot you! You were just gonna let him
fucking get away with it?

667
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,220
I told you that's
my business, not yours!

668
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,610
And what did you do?
Nothing!

669
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,380
Zero!
A big fucking jerk-off!

670
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,490
- Fuck you!
- I oughta break your fucking neck!

671
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,160
Stop cryin'.
Stop cryin'!

672
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,340
I guess your heart was
in the right place, AJ.

673
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,980
But it's wrong.
Come on.

674
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,810
- What?!
- It's not in your nature.

675
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,180
You don't know me.
And you don't know anything about me.

676
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,660
You're a nice guy and that's a good
thing, for Christ's sakes.

677
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,160
- Bullshit!
- I mean it.

678
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,700
You're a good guy.
I'm very grateful.

679
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,700
Well, you're a fucking
hypocrite,

680
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,890
because every time
we watch "Godfather"

681
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,870
when Michael Corleone
shoots those guys at the restaurant,

682
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,870
those assholes
who tried to kill his dad,

683
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,340
you sit there with your fucking
bowl of ice cream

684
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,950
and you say it's your
favorite scene of all time!

685
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,780
Jesus Christ, AJ...

686
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,250
you make me wanna cry.

687
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
It's a movie.

688
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,230
You gotta grow up.

689
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,700
You're not a kid anymore.

690
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,770
Did you hear me?
You gotta grow up.

691
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,850
Get in the car.

692
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,270
First of all, your mother does not
find out about this.

693
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,150
Yes?

694
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,020
I know you don't wanna sell,
but I thought you should know--

695
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,220
Jamba Juice upped their offer
to 275 a square foot.

696
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,130
$494, 000.

697
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,130
You're kiddin' me.

698
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,800
Plus they'll let you
carry the note at 7. 5%.

699
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,270
Any interest?

700
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,450
- Sold.
- Excellent.

701
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,220
Why don't you come by my office
tonight and sign the papers?

702
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,290
Look, uh...

703
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,120
how about
your apartment instead?

704
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,820
Good idea.
Want me to give you the address?

705
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,400
I remember.
The glove factory.

706
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,000
See you around 9:00?

707
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,770
Yeah. Okay.
I'll see you then.

708
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,250
Can I get an order
of johnnycakes?

709
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,990
- Short stack or tall?
- Tall.

710
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,640
Coffee?

711
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,780
Sometimes you tell
a lie so long...

712
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,620
you don't know
when to stop.

713
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,350
You don't know
when it's safe.

714
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,790
I hear you.

715
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,050
You looking for your
French blue?

716
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,050
- Here, I just ironed it.
- Oh.

717
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,150
Thanks.

718
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,180
Ooh, the Canali.
Very nice.

719
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,190
Where are you going?

720
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,090
I've got a... real estate thing.
Ahem--

721
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,830
My handsome man.

722
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,950
I can't get used
to this torque.

723
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,120
What?

724
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,580
So my landlord,
this fucking Armenian asshole,

725
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,750
won't give me my deposit back.
Seven grand!

726
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,150
My dad's, like,
super pissed!

727
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,590
Anyway, I was thinking
maybe you could talk to your dad

728
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,060
who could send someone
to lean on this prick a little

729
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,530
and get him to give me
my money back.

730
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,430
Soprano's the man!

731
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,990
Hey, are you okay?

732
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,420
You want some...?

733
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,530
No.

734
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,070
Hi.

735
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,530
Champagne?

736
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,000
- We're celebrating, aren't we?
- I guess.

737
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,840
In the trade, this is called
"the Ben Franklin close"--

738
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,070
placing the pen
on the line you want someone to sign.

739
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,310
Theoretically, it makes it
harder for them

740
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,420
to have second thoughts.

741
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,380
I'll have to show you
my collection sometime--

742
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,360
"the Franklin Mint."

743
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
- You're not serious.
- What do you mean?

744
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,530
Okay, the contract.

745
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,530
Ahem--

746
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,500
Sign here...

747
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,970
and here...

748
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
here...

749
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
and here...

750
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,040
and here...

751
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,550
and deed of trust here...

752
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,130
disclosures here.

753
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,830
Initial it here.

754
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,560
Okay, title ID there.

755
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,100
Okay, phase one,

756
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,770
sign here...

757
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,670
and there...

758
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,710
and here.

759
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,250
And...

760
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,020
that's it.

761
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,390
Stop.

762
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,200
- What?
- Just stop.

763
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,960
Okay.

764
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,150
- Am I done?
- "Done"?

765
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,150
Yes, signing.
Am I done?

766
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,020
Uh, yeah.

767
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,120
I gotta go.

768
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,120
Shit.

769
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,750
Hey. Hey, man,
are you all right?

770
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,890
I'm a doctor.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

771
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,360
My heart,
it's beating so fast.

772
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,000
Did you take anything--
cocaine, amphetamines?

773
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,330
No.

774
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,940
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

775
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,600
Do you have a history
of panic attacks?

776
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,180
God damn it!

777
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,990
Tony?

778
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,120
Hi. How did it go?

779
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,360
What's it take to get some
fucking smoked turkey in this house?

780
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,800
- What?
- I bust my ass all day long,

781
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,100
when I come home
I want a little smoked turkey.

782
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,030
ls that too fucking much
to ask?!

783
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,730
What the fuck
is your problem?!

784
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,740
Everything but fucking
turkey in here!

785
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,110
Did you hear?

786
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,940
A goddamn juice place
moving in here.

787
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,610
What Jews?

788
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,410
Juice.
Jamba Juice.

789
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,680
You boss went
and sold the building.

790
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,260
He sold the building?
I got a kid in college!

791
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,020
Where are
my fucking eggs?

792
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,870
What the fuck is happening
to this neighborhood?
