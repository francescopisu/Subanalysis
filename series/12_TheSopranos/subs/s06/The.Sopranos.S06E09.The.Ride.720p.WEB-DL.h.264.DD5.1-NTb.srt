1
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:42,464
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?

2
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:45,534
Live or die,
make your choice.

3
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:48,974
Who the fuck
are you?

4
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:00,555
What the fuck
you doing in there?

5
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:02,715
We're gonna
miss the previews.

6
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,195
What?

7
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:10,225
Tell me your earring went
in the fucking drain again.

8
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,195
I'm pregnant.

9
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,996
I know it's my fault. I know I shouldn't
have let you take off the rubber.

10
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,936
I thought we were okay. I was due for my
period. My cycle's like clockwork.

11
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,106
Stop.

12
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,216
- I'll call the clinic tomorrow.
- Stop talking.

13
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:46,757
Let's get married.

14
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,767
What?

15
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,577
We'll drive to A. C.,
make a day out of it.

16
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,437
Are you serious?

17
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,107
Christopher.
I love you.

18
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:13,918
- My baby.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:16,688
My ex, she couldn't have kids,
and I wanted 'em so bad.

20
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,968
The one who
ran out on you?

21
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,638
You can bet she's having some other
asshole's kid, though.

22
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:28,508
That fucking tramp.

23
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,819
Elzear, patron saint
of zeppoles.

24
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,799
Could use a shot
of lacquer.

25
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,169
- Fix that halo, too.
- Shh!

26
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,239
Hello.

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Mr. Gaultieri,
I'm Father Jose.

28
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,340
I'm Mr. Gaultieri.
Where's Father Felix?

29
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,210
Unfortunately he's ill.

30
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,710
He's having bypass surgery.
He asked me to fill in.

31
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,480
You know Mr. Russamano
from the Neighborhood Association.

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,590
Sure, Paulie, Chuck,
how you feeling?

33
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,720
He was an altar boy.

34
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,380
Ahh.

35
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,720
So the Feast
of St. Elzear.

36
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,730
Father Felix brought me
up to speed.

37
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:23,891
I'd like to hear your
ideas for this year.

38
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,831
Well, there ain't much
to talk about.

39
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,371
It's all done through
our nonprofit corporation.

40
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,941
We close the streets
for five days,

41
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:33,371
hire the food vendors,
rides, et cetera.

42
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:04,779
-fÃ¶r de hemlÃ¶sa och sprÃ¥kundervisning
fÃ¶r de flersprÃ¥kiga barnen.

43
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,121
- Statsbidragen Ã¤r lÃ¤gre Ã¤n nÃ¥gonsin.
- Tror du att festen Ã¤r gratis?

44
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,341
You say a couple
of prayers and that's that.

45
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,681
All's said and done,
you get your end.

46
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,411
About that, as I was
telling Mr. Russamano,

47
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:49,691
frankly $ 10,000
struck me as quite low.

48
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,732
It is what it is.

49
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,732
Look, I'm new here.
I certainly don't wanna rock the boat.

50
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,492
I realize there are
certain neighborhood traditions.

51
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,902
It's just that given the current costs,
we feel an increase

52
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,842
- is long overdue.
- What kind of increase?

53
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,882
We feel $50,000 would be
a more equitable donation.

54
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,912
- 50?
- Just this year,

55
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,772
we started a soup kitchen
for the homeless,

56
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,472
a reading program
for bilingual children.

57
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:13,683
There's less help than ever
from the federal government.

58
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:15,683
You think this feast
pays for itself?

59
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,293
Security, electric,
sanitation.

60
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,123
- Not to mention fuel costs.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:23,193
The way it seems
to break down is you spend $18

62
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,453
for a city permit
to close down the street,

63
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,603
charge fees
to the vendors

64
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,933
in the thousands
of dollars to lease out land

65
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,633
that you don't
even own.

66
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:34,973
Yeah? Well, it seems to me the church
has plenty in its coffers

67
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,303
for all those
pedophilia lawsuits.

68
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,574
The parish's deal was negotiated since
this was Johnny Soprano's feast.

69
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,444
These are different times,
Mr. Gaultieri.

70
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,184
Well, some things
don't change.

71
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,294
Couple of days, Joe Vella from the Honor
Guard will be by with the float.

72
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:52,124
Transfer the statue
from his niche,

73
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,284
pick up the hat
and other stuff.

74
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,484
You say things
don't change.

75
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,424
This feast was started
over 100 years ago

76
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,434
in a spirit of giving.

77
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,534
Italian immigrants,
the working poor

78
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,645
gave what little money
they had to honor St. Elzear.

79
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,335
He's the patron saint
from my grandparent's town--

80
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,035
Ariano di Puglia.

81
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,345
Many of those folks gave their gold
wedding bands, which were melted

82
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,445
- down to make the saint's hat.
- Yeah?

83
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,685
The Holy Society
of St. Elzear,

84
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,295
of which you are
recording secretary,

85
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,015
has for the past
100 years entrusted us

86
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,665
with the care
of that habiliment.

87
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,096
Frankly...

88
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,496
I don't feel safe
giving it over this year.

89
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,006
We use it every year.
It's part of the tradition.

90
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,006
I understand,
but I'm sorry.

91
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,006
Given the tenor of this conversation,
I sense there's a possible

92
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,646
criminal element
in this neighborhood

93
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:47,376
that could endanger
this precious piece of local history.

94
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:51,506
But for 50 grand,
you wouldn't have that sense.

95
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,657
It would demonstrate to me that you
take this feast as seriously

96
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,227
as the people
who began it.

97
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,097
Okay, Father,
nice meeting you.

98
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,537
Fuck the hat!

99
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,888
It's fucking bullshit.

100
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,078
I got a fax from Eddie Lind,
Allegheny Carting.

101
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:27,718
They wanna raise
the tipping fee again on solid waste.

102
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:30,598
Just the man
I wanted to see.

103
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:34,258
I gotta go down to Pennsylvania
and I'm gonna need backup.

104
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,868
I'm busy managing
the feast.

105
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,968
Vice president
in charge of calzones.

106
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,128
Where the fuck
you been anyway?

107
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,749
ls that what
I think it is?

108
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,009
You are now looking
at a newly married man.

109
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,779
- Ho-ho-holy shit!
- Kelli?

110
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,519
What the fuck
brought this on?

111
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,129
Visit from the stork
coming up.

112
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,029
You never heard
of pulling out?

113
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,459
Sweetheart, little
Cristal over here.

114
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,860
- You know what you're having?
- Boy, I hope.

115
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,060
I tell ya, T,
with the example you set,

116
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,680
plus the wisdom
I learned from AA,

117
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,900
it's an inspiration--
building blocks,

118
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,240
home, family.

119
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,440
Yeah, that's what
it's all about, kid.

120
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,450
Just water for me.

121
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,820
My son will
be my strength.

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,250
Yeah.

123
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,091
I did?

124
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:36,121
What are you,
new in the office?

125
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,491
Talk to Dr. Cipolla.

126
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,731
I don't pay
for missed appointments.

127
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,501
- To the baby.
- To the baby.

128
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,541
- Salut.
- Salut.

129
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,671
Make a note to call
Freddie at DiSorbo's.

130
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,711
He wants to sponsor
the cannoli-eating contest,

131
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,211
I better see an envelope
by tomorrow.

132
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,492
Anyway, my guy
at the weigh station's on board.

133
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:03,852
- You know how to get back, right?
- I MapBlasted it.

134
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,992
All right, see you guys.

135
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:15,362
Look, Pittsburgh.

136
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,802
What the fuck?
We're supposed to be headed east.

137
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:23,672
Are we. 7 miles
past Route 62 yet?

138
00:09:25,673 --> 00:09:27,813
I gotta take a piss.

139
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,144
You seeing this?

140
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,414
Looks like bikers.

141
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:08,724
Wooden crates.

142
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,764
It's good wine.

143
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,626
- What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you guys?

144
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:47,396
- That's who I am, you mangy cocksucker.
- Take it easy.

145
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:51,066
On the ground or I'll blow your greasy
fucking heads off.

146
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,436
- You guys cops?
- How's your incision, Lieutenant?

147
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:55,036
10-4.

148
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,646
You're fucking with
the Vipers here, asshole.

149
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,706
Ooh, really?

150
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,406
What's that,
your Girl Scout troop?

151
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,377
Shut up,
fucking douchebag.

152
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:05,587
Let's go.

153
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:11,287
- Get him!
- Ow!

154
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,467
I hit him!
I fucking hit him!

155
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:25,107
Fuck you!

156
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:29,478
Yee-ha!

157
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:38,648
That was fucking awesome.
Fucking old-school shit.

158
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,448
Opportunity knocked.

159
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,288
Knocked? Kicked
the fucking door in.

160
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,698
Oh, fuck!

161
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:49,528
You okay, T?

162
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:52,068
Fucking ankle,
I guess I sprained it.

163
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:00,639
You smell that?
It's fucking autumn.

164
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,539
It's like the first fall night when
you're a kid, and the air's all crisp,

165
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,909
and you start smelling
people's fireplaces.

166
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,949
Smells like Halloween.

167
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,989
Ha ha!

168
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh...

169
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,870
Chateau Pichon-Longueville,
1986.

170
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,270
'86-- ooh, baby.

171
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,460
Show me the money.

172
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,310
What's your corkage fee?

173
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,380
How about that prick's
face when he saw the gat?

174
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,520
The Grizzly Adams
motherfucker?

175
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,921
"Whoa, take it easy."

176
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,791
"We're with the Vipers."

177
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,511
How's that wine, good?

178
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,472
It really is,
I gotta say.

179
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,682
I tell ya, though,

180
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,912
when he pulled
that trigger,

181
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,892
I almost shit myself.

182
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,592
Yeah.

183
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,592
I miss it sometimes.
I'll be honest.

184
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:34,743
The wine.

185
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,913
You should toast
to your wedding, at least.

186
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:41,443
Your kid.

187
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:46,053
Discipline, that's all.

188
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,883
Set limits for myself.

189
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,334
On the other side,
they consider wine food.

190
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:01,494
Oh, yeah?

191
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:06,104
- Salut.
- Salut.

192
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:16,484
I'm gonna have to
sleep on my back.

193
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,354
- What are you doing?
- Nightcap.

194
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,954
There's a Swiss Army
in the console.

195
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:32,135
When you think of the shit
we've been through, huh?

196
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,235
Shit we've done.

197
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,845
Fucking
Three Musketeers.

198
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,376
We got a bond.

199
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,476
It's very special.

200
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,626
You saved my life
in a lot of ways.

201
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,636
You've been there for me,
too, you know?

202
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,806
Don't think
I don't know that.

203
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,997
There were times

204
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,007
it was hard
with me and you.

205
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,667
I didn't understand.

206
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:23,357
You were young.

207
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,417
Stubborn.

208
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,987
You always had
my back, though.

209
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,057
Like that day
when I came to the house.

210
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,408
I gotta talk to you.

211
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:01,818
What's wrong?

212
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,459
What's the matter?

213
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:08,759
You know I've always
been loyal to you, T.

214
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,439
What are you trying
to tell me, Christopher?

215
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:18,839
I can't even say it.

216
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,679
Oh, fuck.

217
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:26,449
Adriana.

218
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,120
What about her?

219
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,350
The feds.

220
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,830
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

221
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,000
How long?

222
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,800
- How fucking long?
- A year, I don't know.

223
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,741
When did you find out?

224
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:57,111
She just told me
last night.

225
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,211
What do they know, huh?

226
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:02,151
- What did she give 'em?
- I don't know.

227
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,691
Might take a lot.

228
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:09,421
Ralphie?

229
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,731
I don't know.

230
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,131
Oh, Tony, how could
you even think that?

231
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,302
Where is she?

232
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,682
- Where the fuck is she? Where is she?
- Please, Ton'.

233
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:31,322
Where is she?

234
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,352
She's home.

235
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:42,122
I can't.
I can't do it, Ton'.

236
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,733
No, please,
don't make me do it.

237
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:48,203
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

238
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,903
All right.

239
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:52,633
I can't.

240
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:54,403
- All right.
- I can't do it.

241
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,603
I'm gonna
take care of it.

242
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,653
All right.

243
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,083
Come on, come on.

244
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:07,483
Now listen to me.

245
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,684
You go upstairs.

246
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,094
You go out
the back door.

247
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,134
Don't talk to Carmela.

248
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:20,104
You go someplace,
have a cup of coffee.

249
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:22,604
You wait
till I call you.

250
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,744
Huh?

251
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:27,774
It's okay. We're gonna
take care of it.

252
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:33,215
Go ahead.

253
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,495
I love you, man.

254
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,276
I love you, too.

255
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,817
- I like it.
- Welcome.

256
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:48,988
- Joan Gillespie, Pagano Realty.
- Kelli Moltisanti.

257
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:52,258
We spoke on the phone.
My husband Christopher.

258
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:55,198
- How do you do?
- This is what I'm talking about.

259
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,428
"Stately Wayne Manor."

260
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:01,268
Four bedrooms, marble baths
with Kohler fixtures.

261
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,638
Sub-Zero in the
stainless steel kitchen.

262
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,608
We'll take it.

263
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,768
He's what we call
an impulse buyer.

264
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,978
Shouldn't we see
the inside first, sweetie?

265
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:12,888
If it has an inside,
we're buying it.

266
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,839
Where's the rest?
Five days rent in advance, I said.

267
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,640
What if it rains? Ohio State Fair gives
you a rebate for bad weather.

268
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,180
Yet another reason
I don't live in Ohio.

269
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,190
Easy on the sugar, hon'.
They tell me I'm sweet enough.

270
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,430
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

271
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,430
Jesus Christ,
what did he do now?

272
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,360
It's an old polo injury.

273
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,601
- Huh?
- Let me talk to you a minute.

274
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:12,851
Couple of guys we know,

275
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,321
Lebanese or some shit,

276
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:16,951
they diverted a truck,

277
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,251
whole semi-trailer full
of Centrum Multivitamins.

278
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,261
That's a fucking score.

279
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:23,261
Yeah, the thing is
it's gotta be unloaded out of state,

280
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,951
'cause the troopers are on it.
You interested?

281
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:30,592
Could be distributed
in Long Island.

282
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,172
What's my end?

283
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:37,672
50-50, but it's
gotta be done now, tonight.

284
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,432
Tonight?

285
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:45,112
All right,
but in this case,

286
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:48,412
I'm thinking we spare John the stress
of having to hear about this.

287
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:58,563
The situation he's in,
he's got enough to deal with.

288
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,163
Get me Frankie Cosme
on the cell.

289
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:24,054
Yeah, somebody wants
to talk to you. Hold on.

290
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:39,474
Did you pray?

291
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,664
Said a "thank you"
for Daddy's recovery.

292
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:46,975
You had arthroscopic surgery,
you can't bend a knee?

293
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,045
Dad said he's gonna
meet us on the corner.

294
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:55,485
Isn't that Ade's mom?

295
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:59,095
- Oh my God. She looks terrible.
- Who?

296
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:02,195
Chris' ex, her mom.

297
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,565
She saw us.
I should say hello.

298
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:10,436
Liz, hi.

299
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,976
I saw you're on the committee.
That's so great.

300
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,006
Carmela Soprano.

301
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,876
- How's your daughter?
- Fine.

302
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,846
Well, mine is dead.

303
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:21,506
Oh my God, when?
What happened?

304
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:25,086
When? That piece
of shit, your nephew.

305
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:28,086
They broke up, Liz.
She ran off.

306
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:30,386
She doesn't call me
for almost two years.

307
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,426
My birthday,
Christmas.

308
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:35,427
You two always did have
a very difficult relationship.

309
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:37,567
The FBI came
to my home.

310
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,567
You'd be amazed
at the questions they asked me.

311
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:42,707
- Liz--
- They admitted

312
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,367
they think that he killed her.

313
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,377
Come on, Liz,
you're drunk.

314
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:49,677
Drunk?
It's called depression.

315
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:52,377
I haven't had a drink
in years.

316
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,018
There were times,
I was a kid,

317
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:03,098
my friend Ronnie, we'd play
on the floor of my kitchen--

318
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:06,888
linoleum, Matchbox cars
or whatever.

319
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:09,828
He'd go home, his fucking knees
would be filthy.

320
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:13,738
His elbows--
she never cleaned, my mother.

321
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:16,898
Fucking house
was a pigsty.

322
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:20,238
Ronnie's mother made
him stop coming over it was so dirty.

323
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:23,078
- That's fucked up.
- Embarrassing.

324
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,649
My kid,
it'll be different.

325
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,149
He'll be proud
of his house.

326
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,519
Wait till you see
this place.

327
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,719
So that thing,
Rusty Milio,

328
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:37,799
I heard that happened.

329
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:39,989
Good job.

330
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,829
It's a little less cash
than we talked about.

331
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:45,269
But there's a bonus
in there for you.

332
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,740
It's okay
if I fix?

333
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,910
Just take me
to my car.

334
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,580
Rock out
with your cock out.

335
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,660
Fireplace,
parquet floors,

336
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:14,631
bumper pool table
in the basement.

337
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,671
- Huh?
- The house I'm getting.

338
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,861
You'll come over.

339
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:23,031
Christmas,
Christmas Eve, maybe.

340
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:25,801
I'm gonna start
a tradition.

341
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:31,081
You know, you really gotta
get yourself some help with this shit.

342
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:32,951
I will.
I'm gonna.

343
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:42,792
Those fucking works,
though.

344
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:46,232
Whets my whistle, that spike.
Why is that?

345
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:49,862
I don't know.

346
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:55,702
You want some?

347
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:57,542
Me? Nah.

348
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:04,343
Okay, it's just,
you know, if you want.

349
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,723
Guess I could toot some.

350
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,573
I remember...

351
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:23,363
when I did
a lot of blow,

352
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,373
I used
to get diarrhea

353
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,803
just from the smell
of paper money--

354
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:32,344
in a store,
any fucking place,

355
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,784
on account of all
the baby laxative in the coke

356
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,424
when you actually
snort it.

357
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:41,594
I meant what I said,
though,

358
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:44,954
you need to get
your ass to rehab.

359
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:48,194
Fucking Narcotics
Anonymous or some shit.

360
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,215
How do you like
this car?

361
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,655
It's nice,
the leather.

362
00:29:57,722 --> 00:29:59,222
See ya.

363
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:04,722
Here he comes.

364
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:07,132
God bless you,
St. Elzear.

365
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,772
Where's his gold hat?

366
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:23,283
Pray for my mother,
St. Elzear.

367
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,953
Hey, they forgot
his hat.

368
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:32,023
This is my nephew George,
just back from Iraq.

369
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:36,293
- Two tours he done.
- I'm proud of you, my friend.

370
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:46,014
What do you need?

371
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:48,044
I don't know.

372
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:53,384
There's prosciutto in there,
some leftover sesame noodles.

373
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,154
Tofu would make
your doctor happy.

374
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:14,905
How's the ankle?

375
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:16,665
It's better.

376
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,715
Cold packs helped.

377
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:23,355
Did you have
the riser fixed?

378
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:27,455
Yeah, yeah, Brian Spatafore
was over the Pork Store.

379
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:30,716
Had him tighten up
the banister, everything.

380
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,756
You all right?

381
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:37,626
I have been debating
all night whether

382
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:39,856
to even say anything
about this.

383
00:31:45,296 --> 00:31:48,146
I ran into Liz La Cerva
at the feast.

384
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:53,116
- Yeah...
- She's got it in her head

385
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,577
that Christopher
killed Adriana.

386
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:01,747
What?
That's insane.

387
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,617
I know.

388
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:07,887
Then again, he does have
a history of being free with his hands.

389
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:10,367
That makes him O. J.?

390
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,627
She was probably drunk.

391
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,997
I really don't
think she was.

392
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,468
Let me school you
on domestic violence, okay?

393
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,708
First and foremost,
there's always a body.

394
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:26,478
And 99 out of 100--

395
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:28,818
and this comes straight
from my cop buddies--

396
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,788
it happens either
in the bedroom or in the kitchen.

397
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:36,258
He killed her,

398
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,688
believe me, with the forensics
they got nowadays,

399
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:42,768
the fibers,
we'd know about it.

400
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,239
The FBI came
to her house-- Liz.

401
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,169
That's exactly my point.
If they really thought he did it,

402
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,039
how fast do you think
they'd haul his ass in?

403
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,669
Sour grapes, Carm.

404
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,819
He dumps her daughter, all of a sudden
he's Scott fucking Peterson.

405
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,249
- I thought Ade dumped him.
- You know what I mean.

406
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:06,479
She was a sweet girl, Ade,

407
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,960
but the two of them together
was a toxic relationship.

408
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,330
Yeah, they did have
a rough time of it.

409
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,090
And he's doing great--
Christopher.

410
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,100
He's a different person.

411
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,100
He's married.
He's got a kid on the way.

412
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,300
He's focused.

413
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,800
Let's not sabotage
his progress.

414
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,210
Hmm?

415
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:41,161
Have a dozen extra large
brought over to Satriale's.

416
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,821
- Hello.
- Paul, Dr. Cipolla.

417
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,231
I'm on my way out. I received
the results of your PSA test.

418
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:51,531
- And?
- Not to worry.

419
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:53,611
But the numbers
are a little higher than I prefer.

420
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,641
- What does that mean?
- Probably nothing.

421
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:00,112
Likelihood is prostatitis,
simple inflammation.

422
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:03,542
You have a history
of prostate cancer in your family?

423
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:06,652
- Father maybe?
- I don't know.

424
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,452
Well, I'd like to go ahead
and schedule you for a biopsy.

425
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:15,332
This is lame.
I wanna go on the Octopus.

426
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,552
Can you stop for one minute
breaking my balls?

427
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,862
When your father gets
back from the bathroom with Sophia,

428
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:22,162
- you can go on whatever.
- It's a kiddie ride.

429
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:24,833
Yeah, but she wants
to go on the ride with her big brother.

430
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:28,303
Here we go!
You ready, baby?

431
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:29,913
Go for a ride
with Mama?

432
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:31,843
This is too small.
I'll be all squished.

433
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,213
Yeah, so you go sit
in that one, and wave to her.

434
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,373
Oh, there's my girl.

435
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:39,583
There's my girl!

436
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:42,923
Yeah, are you ready to go
on the ride with Mama?

437
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,963
Are you ready?
Get ready.

438
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:49,434
Yeah,
we're gonna go soon.

439
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:53,194
Oh, here we go!

440
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:56,274
All around the floor.

441
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,344
Wipe that puss
off your face.

442
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:26,125
- My baby!
- Oh my God, call an ambulance!

443
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:28,395
Excuse me!

444
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:31,275
It's okay. It's okay.

445
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:32,915
This is
a temperature gun.

446
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,635
217 degrees.

447
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,876
Look at that.

448
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:43,486
- Yeah.
- Paulie, it's me.

449
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:46,146
We had a problem down here.
The ride--

450
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,846
the Teacups
or whatever,

451
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:50,186
a bolt busted.
Thing jammed up.

452
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,796
- Some people got hurt.
- Where's the guy who owns it?

453
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:55,126
He's talking
to the cops.

454
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,496
Fine, fuck it.
What do you want from me?

455
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,766
It's pretty bad, Paulie.
Lady broke her wrist.

456
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:03,437
Some Puerto Rican kid
lost some teeth.

457
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:05,477
What am I,
a fucking dentist?

458
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:07,737
I don't know.
I thought you'd want to know.

459
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:09,977
Maybe come down
or something.

460
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:13,887
I gotta be up in the morning.
I got my fucking biopsy.

461
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,357
All right,
I'll take care of it.

462
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,627
Now's your last chance
to take advantage...

463
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:24,627
One second
you're sitting there

464
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,627
enjoying a ride
with your family,

465
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:28,998
the next your entire
world comes crashing down.

466
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:32,198
I close my eyes.
I can still hear the screams.

467
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,168
We should all be
thankful it's okay.

468
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,178
My baby could have
been killed, Tony.

469
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:39,208
God forbid.

470
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:43,718
You can bet the locals
will be parading in with their lawsuits.

471
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,878
El mucho pesos.

472
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,759
Just leave it alone,
Janice.

473
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:56,629
They are entitled
to damages.

474
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,729
Obviously,
there was negligence.

475
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,129
Good, so then they'll have excuses
why they can't go to work.

476
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,209
When I think what
could have happened

477
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,339
to my baby...

478
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,569
Oh, yes, you, Nica.

479
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,769
I'm talking
about you, angel.

480
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,419
Oh, God, I wanna
bite those cheeks.

481
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:16,309
Scumbag hillbilly,
I should have kicked his ass.

482
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,250
Yeah, and what
did you do? Nothing.

483
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,650
I was taking Sophia
to the bathroom.

484
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,060
Mmm, this wine,
Tony, you're right.

485
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,760
Delicious.

486
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,600
I was just thinking
it lost some of its...

487
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,830
I don't know-- pop.

488
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:54,451
Manager.
You gotta move your car.

489
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:57,091
I said I'm coming.

490
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:05,801
You redneck fuck. My baby was
on that ride with my wife.

491
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:08,442
She woke up this morning,
she could barely move her neck.

492
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:12,102
I told the cops, mister. I'm sorry.
Insurance will pay your hospital bill.

493
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:15,682
- $25,000 cash.
- What?

494
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:17,782
New Jersey has stringent
liability laws.

495
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,812
I told the guy who hired me
I'd have to put on

496
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:22,822
a whole repair crew, work 'em all night.
He wouldn't spring for it.

497
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,252
Who, Paulie?
What are you talking about?

498
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:27,392
First off, he wouldn't
pay for my "A" fleet.

499
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,362
I leased that to the Sorghum Festival
down in Atlanta.

500
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,833
Okay, the results
of the steroid test are in.

501
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:37,733
The contestants,
they're all clean.

502
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,003
I want a fair
contest here.

503
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:43,663
No biting each other.

504
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:47,073
Ready, set, mangia.

505
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:53,653
Man, we got some race
going on over here, ladies and gents.

506
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,343
Look at 'em go.

507
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:58,043
Hey, cocksucker!

508
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:01,854
You hire some fly-by-night
piece of shit and you don't tell nobody?

509
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:04,024
- Whoa, Bobby.
- What the fuck you talking about?

510
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:05,684
You know what I'm talking
about, you cheap fuck!

511
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:07,734
Bobby, come on!

512
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:10,464
Everybody wants to get rich,
but you don't scrimp on safety.

513
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:13,834
- Mind your business, Bobby.
- My baby girl was in that car!

514
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:16,374
- You owe me money, Paulie.
- I owe you shit.

515
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,804
- My wife's got nerve damage!
- Fuck her, too!

516
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:20,884
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy, easy.

517
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,915
Calm down.
Keep moving.

518
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:36,185
Go ahead, it's over.
Crown the winner.

519
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:38,925
I was at the feast,
St. Elzear's.

520
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,935
The thing for us kids was
to blow powdered sugar

521
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,625
on each other
from the zeppoles.

522
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:51,376
Thousands of people
either praying or eating.

523
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:56,276
Anyway, my sister
was on this ride

524
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:59,256
with my niece
when it lurched forward

525
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,716
- pretty bad.
- God.

526
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,556
He wasn't there,
just Elzear.

527
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,926
But he was so busy
getting money pinned to his ass

528
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:09,926
that he got distracted
and a bolt snapped.

529
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:12,266
Were they hurt?

530
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,297
You look around, all these people
are lined up for this shit.

531
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:17,467
The kids, adults,
families.

532
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:19,297
Rides.

533
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,777
Yeah, they pay money
so they can almost puke.

534
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:23,917
They scream, they yell.

535
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:26,277
Why do you think that is?

536
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,347
They're bored.

537
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,857
Are you bored?

538
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:40,758
Am I bored?

539
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:46,028
I got shot in the pancreas
and I recovered.

540
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:48,108
No brain damage
from the septic shock,

541
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,828
like everybody
figured I'd have.

542
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:54,638
You know my feelings.
Every day is a gift.

543
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:57,408
It's just...

544
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:01,378
does it have to be
a pair of socks?

545
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:08,019
I'm joking.

546
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,989
I'm joking.

547
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,799
Well, what are
you gonna do?

548
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,869
It's the human
condition.

549
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,839
What is?

550
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,150
I don't know.

551
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,150
Yeah, this is Peter Gaultieri.

552
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,680
I'm calling for the result
of my biopsy again.

553
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,190
I'm sorry, sir.
They're still not in.

554
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,320
This is cancer
we're talking about.

555
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,890
I understand, sir.
You'll have to call back tomorrow.

556
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,871
Gimme an espresso...

557
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,601
and don't touch
the lemon rind with your fingers.

558
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,251
Hello, Paulie.

559
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:04,251
What are you
doing here?

560
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:07,581
The home. It's one
of our outings.

561
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:09,381
So you're still
over there, huh?

562
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,591
They've been very nice,

563
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:14,691
and your brother's
trying to work out an arrangement.

564
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:17,851
ls it true
what they're saying?

565
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:21,362
Who? About what?

566
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,132
The ride,
the one that broke.

567
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:27,842
You need to make
a novena, Paulie.

568
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:30,602
- Those poor children.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:33,912
You let St. Elzear
go without his hat.

570
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:36,452
Will you listen to this?
Fuck that voodoo, huh?

571
00:42:36,612 --> 00:42:39,382
You cursed your mother,
a blessed nun.

572
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,382
She had it coming.
You both did.

573
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:43,893
I didn't bring
you up like that.

574
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:46,723
You're a fake.
That's how you brung me up.

575
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:48,163
Fuck the two of you.

576
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:52,563
Sir, your espresso.

577
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:59,873
So in keeping with this
longstanding tradition

578
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,483
of doing everything
ass-fucking-backwards,

579
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:05,633
we are gathered here tonight
for the bachelor party

580
00:43:05,804 --> 00:43:08,754
of already-married man
Christopher Moltisanti.

581
00:43:12,974 --> 00:43:14,214
And like I always say,

582
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,454
a man is not complete
till he's married.

583
00:43:16,614 --> 00:43:18,684
Then he's finished.

584
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:22,664
Chrissy.

585
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:25,464
- Congratulations. T.
- Thanks.

586
00:43:40,945 --> 00:43:42,285
Should we order?

587
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:45,715
- Yeah, what the fuck are the specials?
- Artie.

588
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:53,495
I gotta go, Ton'.
The kids.

589
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,096
- Have fun tonight, huh?
- All right.

590
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:03,606
- Specials, gentlemen.
- Pray tell, my good man.

591
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,006
I got lamb tonight, grilled, garlic,
little rosemary.

592
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,976
Rosemary,
I'll eat her.

593
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:19,786
Hey, T.

594
00:44:19,946 --> 00:44:21,896
You're doing a heck
of a job there, Brownie.

595
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:24,727
Huh?

596
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:26,957
This thing with the ride,
the shit with Bobby,

597
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,097
you settle it
and you settle it now.

598
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:31,567
And not just 'cause
she's my sister, either.

599
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:33,567
- Ton', I--
- You put little kids in jeopardy

600
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,267
in the hands of some
fucking redneck?

601
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:39,007
Not to mention you leave Little Paulie
alone to deal with the cops.

602
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:42,377
I thought he had it
under control.

603
00:44:42,537 --> 00:44:44,377
Let me ask you a question
about the feast.

604
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:46,577
Do we need
negative press?

605
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:48,518
With all the competition
out there

606
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:50,518
for the entertainment
dollar, DVDs,

607
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:52,888
the Internet?

608
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:55,028
You're right, Ton'.

609
00:44:57,688 --> 00:44:59,458
What happened to
the regular ride guy,

610
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:01,998
the guy we used
last year?

611
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,328
For what he wanted to charge,
I'm getting killed here, Ton'.

612
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:07,368
When your dad
had St. Elzear's,

613
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:09,408
it was a cash cow,
and it was easy.

614
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:11,408
Nowadays, between
paying the church,

615
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,069
these Puerto Ricans now,

616
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,379
ha, my profit's
shrunk to nothing.

617
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:17,639
If it don't work
as a business, get rid of it.

618
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:20,619
Not for nothing, but a lot of that feast
goes in your pocket.

619
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:24,719
I got a lot
on my mind, T.

620
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:27,889
- I'm sorry.
- Like what?

621
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,129
I had a biopsy.

622
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,739
I might have
prostate cancer.

623
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,370
Well, it's a biopsy,
right?

624
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,870
Nine times out of 10,
these things come back clean.

625
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,210
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

626
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,710
Don't work yourself
up into a state like you do, hmm?

627
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,910
I've been
having headaches.

628
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,110
I'm afraid maybe the thing
metastasized.

629
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,550
Jesus, will you
listen to yourself, huh?

630
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,180
With all your weird fucking shit about
your body and the germophobias.

631
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:03,060
- You don't know shit yet.
- It's true.

632
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:05,961
I'd rather face 10 guys
with shivs than something I can't see.

633
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:08,871
Exactly. You're too
susceptible to the psychics

634
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:11,771
and the dream messages
and dirty fucking toilet seats.

635
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:13,881
It's a biopsy.

636
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:16,071
Get a grip.

637
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,771
You're right, T.

638
00:46:18,941 --> 00:46:21,851
You know, and negative
thinking can help bring this shit on.

639
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:25,921
Work something out
with Bobby, huh?

640
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,392
And Eddie Lind's coming down
from Pennsylvania with an envelope.

641
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,082
Meet him at the Bing.

642
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:32,492
You call him,
you set up a time.

643
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:42,232
There he is,
the bad lieutenant.

644
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:43,842
Hey.

645
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,972
I sold mine.

646
00:46:49,132 --> 00:46:52,052
$300 for the five cases.

647
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:02,723
Oh, I had a heater
put in the Bloomfield wire room.

648
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:04,993
Guys were complaining.

649
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:07,433
Well, good.

650
00:47:07,593 --> 00:47:10,223
Yeah, yeah,
that's good.

651
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,034
What's new with you?

652
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,684
Copacetic.

653
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:36,354
"We're with the Vipers."

654
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:44,165
- Fun night.
- Fuckin' A.

655
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:48,705
"Take it easy.
Take it easy."

656
00:47:49,735 --> 00:47:51,575
10-4.

657
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:54,775
You remember the look
on the other guy's face?

658
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:58,005
Oh, the fucking
Grizzly Adams douchebag.

659
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:09,426
Yeah.

660
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:25,446
Dr. Cipolla's service.

661
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:27,306
I need to talk
to the doctor.

662
00:48:27,476 --> 00:48:29,246
- ls this an emergency?
- Of course.

663
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,886
Dr. Cipolla's out of town.
Dr. Paglieri's on call.

664
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:33,917
Do you wanna
be connected?

665
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,987
Nah.

666
00:49:20,498 --> 00:49:23,308
Hey, buddy boy,
how you doing?

667
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,039
Any of the girls
working yet?

668
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:32,539
- Last day already. God, it goes fast.
- Yeah.

669
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:35,689
St. Anthony's
the week after next.

670
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,879
What's the matter, baby?

671
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:44,199
Can you believe this? After all this,
she wants to go back on that ride.

672
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,199
She cried
for three nights after.

673
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,600
The ride's closed, baby.

674
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,130
Hey, show everybody
how you can walk.

675
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,140
Come on,
they wanna see.

676
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,640
Okay, show 'em.

677
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,470
Show everybody
how you can walk.

678
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,170
Show 'em.

679
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,080
Baby, come here, baby.
Come on.

680
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,920
Have some candy.
Look, Cracker Jack.

681
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:15,491
Here you go.

682
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,001
Come on.

683
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:26,041
Whoo!

684
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:36,371
Whoa!

685
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:38,112
Where's our belly?

686
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:45,422
As you can tell
by this outfit, folks,

687
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:48,532
I've picked out something
with a little Norwegian flavor.

688
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:51,432
I'd like to play for you
the "Johnny Oslo Shadish."

689
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,962
It's a typical Norwegian
dance, and who could do it better

690
00:50:54,122 --> 00:50:56,532
