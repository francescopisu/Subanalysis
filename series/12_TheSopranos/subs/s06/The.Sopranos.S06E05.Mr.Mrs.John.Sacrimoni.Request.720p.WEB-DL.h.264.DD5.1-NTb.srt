1
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,850
Rusty!

2
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,120
Rusty!

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,120
You don't answer,
someone calls you?

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,390
Look at this
shit now.

5
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,810
What do you got
for me, Counselor?

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,850
The Brioni.

7
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,830
Hear ye, hear ye.

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,940
The Honorable Dennis Holzer of the
Eastern District of New York presiding.

9
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,870
Court is now in session.
Be seated.

10
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,600
Come to order.

11
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,110
The defendant's request for temporary
release from federal custody

12
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,180
to attend his daughter's
wedding is ludicrous.

13
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,810
Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member
of organized crime

14
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,420
at the helm of a vast
criminal conspiracy.

15
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,890
I notice you're wearing
a wedding ring, Ms. Vaughn.

16
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,890
Was your father
at your wedding?

17
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,400
My father wasn't awaiting trial
on 47 RICO predicates,

18
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,500
including murder.

19
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,900
Mr. Sacrimoni...

20
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,440
your application
is granted.

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
- Oh, thank God!
- On the following conditions. Quiet!

22
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,340
You'll be released
for a total of six hours

23
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,110
to attend the church service
and party thereafter.

24
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,280
During the entirety
of the six hours,

25
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,520
you will be escorted
by U. S. marshals.

26
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,560
The cost of their presence,
transportation

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,060
and the cost of metal-detection
screening equipment

28
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,330
is to be borne by you
at your own expense.

29
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,870
You will consume
no alcohol

30
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,310
nor other
intoxicating substances.

31
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,780
Do you understand
and agree to these conditions?

32
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,580
I do, Your Honor,
and thank you.

33
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,140
Mrs. Soprano, good morning.

34
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,850
- I'm Perry... Annunziata.
- Come in.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,990
Beautiful house.

36
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,960
You are Gina Annunziata's
cousin, right?

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,500
Muscles Marinara,
the Italian strongman.

38
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm just glad you got somebody
capable of protecting you,

39
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,900
- driving for you.
- Well, that's why I got him here.

40
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,570
She worries,
my wife.

41
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,770
- Yeah, well...
- He's in good hands, Mrs. Soprano.

42
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,550
Om du vill, kan jag sÃ¤tta
ihop ett trÃ¤ningsprogram.

43
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:05,050
En gÃ¥ng i tiden tog jag 140 i bÃ¤nkpress.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,260
Gosh, I feel
like a mommy.

45
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,320
Hey. Come on.

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,360
See you later.

47
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,260
So what do you do?
Free weights, machines?

48
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,840
Little bit of both. Depends what muscles
I'm trying to hit, you know?

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,770
Oh.

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,710
Yeah, I gotta get
back to the gym.

51
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,210
You want, I'll make you
a program.

52
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,780
There was a time
when I could bench over 300 lbs.

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,920
With a major head cold
one time, I did it.

54
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,100
You cough with weights
like that over your head,

55
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,100
you crush your neck.

56
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,130
I guess I don't
gotta tell you.

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
Ho! You don't signal?

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Hey, fuck you!

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,600
Sorry.

61
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,630
My mom says I should count 10,
but I never remember.

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,880
Well, here I am.

63
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,680
- Back.
- Yep.

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,690
So let me ask you
right off,

65
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,720
is there any chance
of a mercy fuck?

66
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,860
Just kidding.

67
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,560
- How are you feeling?
- You went to medical school.

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,130
A gut shot is everything they ever
told you it was.

69
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,700
And emotionally?

70
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,470
I'm happy to be alive.

71
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,110
Have you spoken
to your uncle since it happened?

72
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,080
No. And won't.

73
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,850
Finally get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

74
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,450
Had a hospital bed
in the house

75
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,420
- last month and a half or so.
- ls sleeping difficult?

76
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,560
- Tylenol helps.
- What about dreams,

77
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
night terrors,
anything like that?

78
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,540
Gloom is your business,
and business is good.

79
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,470
You were shot, Anthony,
by a member of your family.

80
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,870
I know.

81
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,870
And unless I know
absolutely nothing

82
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,240
about what I'm doing,

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,910
I think you and I'll
have a lot to talk about.

84
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you familiar
with the term

85
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,820
"post-traumatic stress"?

86
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,550
I get it, okay?

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,660
My uncle tried to kill me,
for the second time.

88
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,490
Three strikes
and I'm out, right?

89
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,070
Who knows? Maybe I
am suppressing things.

90
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,070
But for right now,
I feel like each day is a gift.

91
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,370
I told my sister.

92
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,230
And that's how
it's gonna stay.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,670
Fair enough.

94
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,610
ls there something
else you'd like to talk about then?

95
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,270
Let's pick up where
we left off before this all happened.

96
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,710
A. J.

97
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Believe it or not,

98
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,820
things have gotten
worse with that kid.

99
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,950
Flunked out of college.
He waited till I was in a coma.

100
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,570
Didn't you leave Seton Hall after
a semester and a half?

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,220
All right, fine,

102
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,630
but why can't he copy
some of the good things about me?

103
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,400
- Does he have a job?
- Blockbuster.

104
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,410
First stop
on the shitbird express.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,030
In some ways, this horrible shooting
may provide an opportunity

106
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,080
for him to learn
from your mistakes.

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,010
My mistakes--

108
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,180
I got caught up
in domestic violence.

109
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,650
You think it can't happen
to you, but it does.

110
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,650
But I was referring
to the bigger picture:

111
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,550
The ready access
to guns,

112
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,250
the use of violence
to solve disputes

113
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,900
because of the nature
of your work, your uncle's work.

114
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,190
I told you I didn't want
to talk about my uncle.

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,930
Fine, but for now
is it safe to say

116
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,700
that there are worse
ways to earn money

117
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,840
than by stocking shelves
at Blockbuster?

118
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,140
Yeah, there are.

119
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,580
- Come on, you in or what?
- Don't fuck with my concentration.

120
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,590
I've warned you before.

121
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,190
What is it?
800 more?

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,800
Fuck it. Fold.

123
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,860
Cards.

124
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,930
Oh! There's the skip.

125
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,270
Back with a vengeance.

126
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,340
- You look great.
- How are you?

127
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,780
Welcome home, T.

128
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,280
- Come here, you malingerer you.
- Easy, easy, easy.

129
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,010
- Great to have you back, T.
- Fucking great to be back.

130
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,160
- Sit, Ton', I'll clear your spot.
- We got you your bialy

131
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,730
as soon as we heard
you were coming in today.

132
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
Nuke that joe
so it's hot.

133
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,530
Oh, fuck.

134
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,970
The onions--
I can't.

135
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,010
Oh, scoop out
that bialy.

136
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,080
- I got it.
- Sorry.

137
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,580
I got it, Ton',
no problem.

138
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,050
There you go. I'll get your coffee,
and you're all set.

139
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,050
So the municipal
swimming pool--

140
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,360
- the bid start on that yet?
- I got a lunch tomorrow.

141
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
That guy Deutsch
from the planning commission.

142
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,930
Antibiotics.

143
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,040
I had that with the spleen.
Staves off the infection.

144
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,270
Spleen, my ass.

145
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Beat this.

146
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,410
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Fuck that.

147
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,450
Check out this bad boy.

148
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,780
I had the plastic surgeon,
Taschlin, do the outside sutures.

149
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,050
Plepler, the head trauma man,
he did the inside work.

150
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,750
He dealt with the sepsis.

151
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,900
I was the first guy
at the hospital to have the VAC.

152
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,230
It's an open-incision
situation.

153
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,930
It's a better way to heal.
Less pulling on the outer dermis layers.

154
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,270
The thing is with all the Ativan
and the Dilaudid I was taking,

155
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,780
intestinal blockage
was a constant fucking problem.

156
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,210
- So in the long run--
- There's your coffee, Ton'.

157
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,440
- Yeah.
- Ton', with your medicine,

158
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,680
you want I set my watch
so you don't gotta worry?

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,580
Nurse Betty over here.

160
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,980
When my mom had the lupus,
God rest her soul,

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,990
'round the clock care
I gave that woman.

162
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,320
Medicine, food, lifted her
in and out of the tub.

163
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,190
- The man's trying to eat.
- I'm just saying.

164
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,530
Another life I might have gone
into health care. I actually enjoyed it.

165
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,030
How about a bandage over your mouth
then? We're trying to play.

166
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,930
You can lift a grown
woman out of a tub?

167
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,800
Isn't it ironic?

168
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,810
Fucking hospital stay
like mine,

169
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,880
you lose goddamn
muscle mass, not fat.

170
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,810
Fucking believe it?

171
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,010
You'd think at least something good
would have come out of the situation.

172
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,660
- You in, Ton'?
- Sure, why not?

173
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,810
- He's in.
- Same game, five-card calls?

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,290
Same game. Why? You wanna change
games now 'cause I won three pots?

175
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,660
Keep the cards
down, Sil.

176
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,930
The government's
own neuropsychologist

177
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,090
clearly finds
evidence of dementia.

178
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Evidence consistent
with dementia.

179
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,070
Nonetheless, I'm going to
recommend he be sent

180
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,800
to a prison psychiatric
facility for further evaluation.

181
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,640
He'll only be warehoused
in a public facility.

182
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,180
Now, Your Honor, we ask
that Mr. Soprano be sent

183
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,320
- to a private locked facility.
- Why not a resort in Antigua?

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,820
You want his mental state
improved so you can put him on trial?

185
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,920
Just let him go to a place where
he can get better.

186
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,930
You got Uncle Angelo
at table 19?

187
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,760
What?
He's with Connie and them.

188
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,100
And when he sees Aunt Lorraine
and the Haitian boyfriend

189
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,210
sitting next to them...

190
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,740
- I thought you were on top of this.
- There's 400 people, John.

191
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,740
I've had other things
on my mind.

192
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,280
And I'm idling
away the hours?

193
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,210
Who's not talking
to who?

194
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,220
This one
can't see that one.

195
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,680
It's okay, honey.
Take it easy.

196
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,290
You were the one
who wanted a big wedding.

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,220
Catherine, your sister has enough
to deal with without the commentary.

198
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,890
I'm sorry I blew
my stack, okay?

199
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,960
We are gonna get through
this as a family-- dignified, proud--

200
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,160
despite all the persecution
and roadblocks.

201
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,500
And when I say family,
that includes you, too, Eric.

202
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,230
- Thank you, John.
- Thank you who?

203
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,380
Thank you, Dad.

204
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,050
You...

205
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,790
I want you to relax.
Make sure you eat.

206
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,650
- You too.
- Me? No, thank you.

207
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,690
I am eight lbs. away from my goal,
and I am fitting in that dress

208
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,330
- if it kills me.
- Jesus, can we ever talk about anything

209
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,360
in this family
besides food?

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,560
- Three sixes.
- Boat, 10s over Jacks.

211
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,470
- Vito, you again.
- All right, that's it for me.

212
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,630
- Banker's hours.
- Pace myself, doctor said.

213
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,780
You'd be surprised
how much energy the body expends

214
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,420
- during the healing process.
- Penne Arabiatta,

215
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,550
go get the car
cooled down, will you?

216
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,280
- Penne Arabiatta.
- Yeah, that's what I call him.

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,550
Red pepper flakes
up his ass.

218
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,450
He's a fucking hothead.

219
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,860
Ton',
Phil Leotardo's here.

220
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,870
All right,
bring him in.

221
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,630
There he is.
Back in business.

222
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,110
- How's the labonza?
- Oh, it's good.

223
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,770
You guys letting him win?

224
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,880
Listen, I need
to bend your ear.

225
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,320
Can't it wait?
I was just about to go.

226
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,820
I just sat in traffic
all the way from Brooklyn.

227
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,390
I was up by John.
He sends his regards.

228
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,900
He'd like you to do
him a favor, though.

229
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,230
What now?

230
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,840
Our friend there,
the Mayor of Munchkinland,

231
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,800
John wants him gone.

232
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
Jesus. Rusty?

233
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
John's worried he might
find another puppet like Little Carmine,

234
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,710
try to run the family
through him.

235
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,910
So why me hit him?

236
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,610
You guys got more buttons
than my grandmother's fucking corsets.

237
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,480
John wants things to point away
from the family.

238
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,850
You know what?
Tell him no.

239
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,860
Time and again
I've done his bidding.

240
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,290
It's time to set
some limits.

241
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,560
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

242
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,440
Be well.

243
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,220
I thought
I heard the door.

244
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,690
How was the first day?

245
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,260
It was good.

246
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,920
- Tired, though.
- You wanna take a nap?

247
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,870
Smells good.

248
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,240
Downy fresh.

249
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,420
God, this feels great.

250
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,490
It does.

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,300
Chris.

252
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,350
Let 'em in.

253
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,420
Ho! Where are the rest
of the 40 thieves?

254
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,460
You got it?

255
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,820
Good week.
120 credit card numbers

256
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,900
plus the three-digit
security codes,

257
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,760
- but I won't charge you no extra.
- Excellent.

258
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,270
- Don't leave home without it.
- No, we'll use them.

259
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,640
No, credit cards.

260
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,670
The commercial.

261
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,710
So Tony's out of hospital.
Please give him our wishes.

262
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,780
We brought him
some dates.

263
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,580
Also, Chris, you know
how we can purchase

264
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,350
a couple of TEC-9 semi-automatics,
extended magazines?

265
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,090
Hold on. TEC-9s?
What the fuck for?

266
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,780
It's a family problem.

267
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,950
My former brother-in-law,
actually.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
All right,
fucking take it easy.

269
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,500
What did the guy say?

270
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,700
Our friend from the other place,
he talked to the guy?

271
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,710
What's his name,
the local guy.

272
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,280
Yeah, yeah, I know.

273
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,720
Hold on.

274
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,390
Yep, I see it.
Thank you, Ro.

275
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,580
Mr. Sacrimoni, I'm Deputy Feathem,
U. S. Marshal Service.

276
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,720
This is my partner
Deputy Mayweather.

277
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,850
We're here to escort you
to the wedding today.

278
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,040
Gentlemen.

279
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,160
Though ordered by the court,
your release is at our discretion.

280
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
So based on your behavior or any other
mitigating factors,

281
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,400
we can elect
to bring you back early.

282
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,410
- Patent leather?
- It's a tuxedo.

283
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,700
Have you read an issue
of "GQ" in the past three or four years?

284
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,220
Allegra Sacrimoni
getting married.

285
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,190
Were we not just
at her christening?

286
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,380
1980-- 50-lb.
bundle of joy.

287
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,790
She'll be a beautiful
bride, Tony.

288
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,830
All brides are beautiful.

289
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,560
Wait till this one gets married.

290
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,500
How much are we giving?
So I can write it down.

291
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,940
You keep tabs on gifts?
How sentimental.

292
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,270
- That's how it's done, Meadow.
- So we can know if they stiff us

293
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,410
- when your big day comes.
- Exactly.

294
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,010
All this pressure.

295
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,740
I know you'd like to think
it's me pressuring you,

296
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,050
but the reality is it's your father
keeps this going.

297
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,420
Please, like you aren't desperate
to have a grandchild.

298
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,220
Any thoughts on when you and Finn
are tying the knot?

299
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
This discussion is over.

300
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,090
Look, sweetie.

301
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,290
It's just...

302
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,300
what I been through,

303
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,340
it changes the way
you think.

304
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,140
Holding my grandkids--

305
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,140
your kids--

306
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,280
on my lap...

307
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,370
all of a sudden,
it's very important to me.

308
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,220
Could I have
your name, sir?

309
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,520
Hey, is that the father?
Jesus Christ.

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,810
Yeah.

311
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,960
Cell phones,
cameras, keys.

312
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,790
All metal objects
must be placed in a tray.

313
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,590
- Sir, what is this?
- Nitroglycerin. What do you think?

314
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,360
Cologne. Smell it,
you don't believe me.

315
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,560
Proceed.

316
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,070
You'd think bin Laden
was getting married in there.

317
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,980
You realize they made John pay
for all this heightened security

318
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,020
- out of his own pocket?
- Are you kidding?

319
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,020
- The government did that?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,350
- You okay?
- Yeah,

321
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,550
- it's hot.
- Almost there.

322
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,570
All metal objects
in the tray, sir.

323
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,510
Jesus Christ!

324
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,650
Arms outstretched,
please.

325
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,630
All right, you'll need to step out
and remove your shoes, sir.

326
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,100
- Oh, come on!
- It's all right.

327
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,680
Tony, Tony!

328
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,810
- Daddy!
- A. J., get him a chair!

329
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,450
I should have worn loafers.

330
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,460
It ain't your fault, T.
It's all this bullshit.

331
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,760
- It's a steam bath.
- I'll get a damp paper towel.

332
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,600
Sorry.

333
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,670
Here, Ton',
some water.

334
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,410
He just got out of the hospital.
Are the shoes really necessary?

335
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,840
- Sorry, Miss.
- Let me do it, don't bend.

336
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,220
All right.

337
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,120
I, Eric, take you,
Allegra, to be my wife.

338
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,930
Allegra. Ain't that
a cold medicine?

339
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,530
It means happiness
in Italian.

340
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,640
What the fuck's that got to do
with cold medicine?

341
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,100
...forsaking all others
so long as you both shall live.

342
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,110
In sickness
and in health,

343
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,800
forsaking all others
as long as we both shall live.

344
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,810
Allegra, repeat
these words.

345
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,610
I, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

346
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,280
I, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

347
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,360
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

348
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,360
for richer
and for poorer...

349
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,500
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

350
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,860
for richer
and for poorer...

351
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,730
In sickness
and in health,

352
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,200
forsaking all others,

353
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,570
so long as we both
shall live.

354
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,600
In sickness
and in health,

355
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,070
forsaking all others,
so long as we both shall live.

356
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,470
Would you believe this place,
the money they've spent?

357
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,160
It's either this or give it to the feds
in the asset seizure.

358
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,370
Check this out. They got a whole
seafood station over there.

359
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,480
- You're not hungry, sweetie?
- I don't eat fish. The toxins.

360
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,210
Pinot grig
for the missus.

361
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,410
- Rum and coke for the kids.
- Thank you.

362
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,420
And a club soda
for the convalescent.

363
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,860
Thank you, sir.

364
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,660
Salut.

365
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,460
Hey, there he is.

366
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,630
Meadow,
you look stunning.

367
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,710
- Thank you.
- And look at this young dentist,

368
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,870
all handsome
in his Calvin Klein.

369
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,070
Some beautiful grandkids
these two will make, huh?

370
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,380
So, Ton',
you got a sec?

371
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,180
Yeah.

372
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,230
Listen, Ton',
I don't mean to talk business,

373
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,230
but I had
to tell you.

374
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,590
I met with that guy Deutsch,
the one from the planning commission.

375
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,360
Not only is he in charge of approving
bids for all city contracts,

376
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,500
he's also a degenerate
horse player.

377
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,300
So he'll play ball?

378
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,940
He's fucking Joe DiMaggio.

379
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,600
And this is from Weehawken,
the strip mall.

380
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,180
Enjoy your day.

381
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,850
Oh, here he is.
Father of the bride.

382
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,960
- Good to see you.
- John, she looks so beautiful.

383
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,620
- It was so moving.
- Thank you, honey. I appreciate it.

384
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,200
All this.

385
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,930
Hey, googootz, you wanna
be an event planner,

386
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,370
you learn from this.

387
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,530
An event planner?
Where do you get this shit?

388
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,800
"Stuff" would do nicely, A. J.
We're at a wedding.

389
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,180
Good to see you,
my friend.

390
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,380
You too, John.

391
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,820
It's been a long time.

392
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,750
Obviously, I couldn't come
visit you in the hospital.

393
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,120
When I heard what happened,
I was devastated.

394
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,820
That's life, huh?

395
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,360
So seriously,
what's the damages here?

396
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,500
What am I in for
with Meadow?

397
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,900
Not counting
the honeymoon, 425.

398
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,560
So adjusting
for inflation,

399
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,370
I'm looking
at half a rock.

400
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,940
What's it all for, though, Tony, huh?
What we put in, the grind.

401
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,010
Isn't that
for things like this?

402
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,540
Yeah.

403
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,050
So I heard Phil
came to see you.

404
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,750
Let's go say hello
to your dad.

405
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,830
So how you doing here?
You having a good time?

406
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,160
- Which one are you?
- My friend Tony, Pop.

407
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,900
Hey, I'm gonna say
a few things,

408
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,010
and these pricks
are watching,

409
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,840
so I'm gonna make like
I'm talking to your dad and them.

410
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,570
Hey, Aunt... Farris.

411
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,180
Hello.

412
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,110
What you asked me to do
with the little guy,

413
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,120
I can't do it.

414
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,120
This fucking prick,

415
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,350
he's disruptive.

416
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,120
He doesn't have the balls
to step up himself.

417
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,260
- What did he say?
- So just keep him away from Phil.

418
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,840
He's a cancer.
I can't let it spread.

419
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,570
Well, you're gonna
have to use one of your own doctors.

420
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,770
Oh, I'd love to.
Believe me.

421
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,470
But my position is
not completely solidified.

422
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,710
You should call
Dr. Cuomo.

423
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,050
- We're just talking here, Aunt Louise.
- Don't eat that pepper!

424
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,060
- When Carmine died...
- What?

425
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,890
... Rusty could have been boss.
He should have been.

426
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,160
But he didn't want
the responsibility.

427
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Like I advised you.

428
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,530
Say no more.

429
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,670
It's too fucking
late now anyway.

430
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,670
I need your help, Tony.

431
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,610
Some of these guys,
my captains,

432
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,510
they find out I'm behind
the move against him?

433
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,640
Make things worse. I can't take
that risk while I'm in jail.

434
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,690
Stay out of trouble.

435
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,090
So I'm supposed
to put myself at risk,

436
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,420
share the same fucking
jail cell as you?

437
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,620
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

438
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,130
Forget it, John.

439
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,430
It's Allegra's
wedding, Tony.

440
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,330
The way things are,

441
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,600
I don't know if I'll be
around for Catherine's.

442
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,710
I know you're going through a rough
time right now, all right?

443
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,740
Then do me
this favor, Tony.

444
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,390
Okay, I'll take care
of it.

445
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,860
I won't forget it.

446
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,720
All right.

447
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,170
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for,

448
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,070
for the first time
anywhere,

449
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,510
let's give a huge hand
and a lot of love to...

450
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,370
Mr. and Mrs.
Eric DiBenedetto!

451
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
for their first dance as man and wife,

452
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,050
Allegra and Eric
have chosen

453
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,220
the lovely...

454
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,950
Please join our bride and groom
on the dance floor.

455
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,450
How you doing
over there?

456
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm okay.

457
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,450
- Wanna dance?
- Really?

458
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,920
It's a slow one.

459
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,000
Thank you, gentlemen.

460
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,980
Okay, Corrado.

461
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,620
- Taking any medication?
- Coumadin.

462
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,730
Not bad, Corrado.

463
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,740
- You got a tree outside.
- Don't bullshit me.

464
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,340
Doctor will be in later
to do a thorough admission.

465
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:23,620
So, I'll check in
with you at the end of the week.

466
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,920
You're gonna get the help
you need here, Corrado,

467
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,250
so you can aid
in your own defense.

468
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,050
I didn't shoot anybody!

469
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,220
Corrado, look, I don't
know you that well, but you have to--

470
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,200
He's my nephew, God damn it.
Why would I shoot him? Why?

471
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,300
The gun was
on the fritz.

472
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,540
I wanna go home.

473
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,540
- Corrado, stop it.
- I wanna go home!

474
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,730
Stop.

475
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,710
You know
that's not possible.

476
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,750
If I did it, the fucking gun
malfunctioned.

477
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,350
It was old, okay?
I should have cleaned it.

478
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,780
Try to get some sleep.

479
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,930
You'll feel better
in the morning.

480
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time

481
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,670
our lovely bride will dance
with her father.

482
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,490
This is how it works,
I'm thinking.

483
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,100
We bring somebody over
from Naples.

484
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,960
What?

485
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,330
Completely insulate ourselves.
They do Rusty,

486
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,410
they're back on a plane
over the Atlantic two hours later.

487
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,770
I don't know, T.
You ask me, farming it out

488
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,440
is a pussy-ass
maneuver.

489
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,420
Excuse me?

490
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,950
Ton', the rollatine!

491
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,920
Hold on.

492
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,620
If we're gonna do it,
we should do it ourselves,

493
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,920
maintain control.

494
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,760
Better yet, tell New York
to fucking handle it already.

495
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,370
John just asked me
specifically.

496
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,160
So it's like
the movie then.

497
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,100
- What movie?
- One.

498
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,800
That you can't
refuse a man's request

499
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,770
- on his daughter's wedding day.
- No, it's the other way around.

500
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,970
That I should be asking
him for something he can't refuse.

501
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,550
- So did you?
- No.

502
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,580
- You should ask not to do this.
- I already fucking agreed.

503
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,650
Look, we wanna keep
him placated, right?

504
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,650
I mean, the shit with Phil
and his little brother

505
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,660
and the perpetual hard-on
he's still got with us.

506
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
I don't think
it's a good idea.

507
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,960
Well, I didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

508
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,440
- Come on.
- You're going already?

509
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,440
He's always like this
at weddings.

510
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,640
You make me sound rude. Crab cakes.
I told you I don't feel good.

511
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,810
They don't keep
in this heat.

512
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,820
Vito, let's go.

513
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,040
Francesca, come on.

514
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,310
Good night.

515
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,760
John, gonna have to
wrap this up.

516
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,160
Six hours you said.
I got till quarter till 11:00.

517
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,230
That includes
transportation, sir.

518
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,630
- You fucking kidding me?
- I tried, John. They won't budge.

519
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,570
Can he have
some cake at least?

520
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,640
You can pack some
to take with you, if you'd like.

521
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
Heartless pricks.

522
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,980
Out front in 20.

523
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,500
Here they come!

524
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,570
Thank you, Daddy.

525
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,080
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

526
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,880
Mom!

527
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,020
You came this close to almost
making your goal.

528
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,020
- Have a great time, sweetheart.
- I'll call you when we land.

529
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,690
Bye, Grandpa.

530
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,430
Say hi to Don Ho.

531
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,500
I love you.

532
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,240
What the fuck?!

533
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
- Let's go, John.
- What? Wait a second.

534
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,650
- Let's go.
- Stand back, please.

535
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,310
Can you let my daughter
leave at least?

536
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,550
- Daddy, what's happening?
- I will not ask you again.

537
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,020
- You motherfucker.
- Oh my God.

538
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,360
- What are you doing?
- Get your hands off him.

539
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
Jesus Christ! ls that
fucking necessary?

540
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,030
Stand back. Now!

541
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,910
John.

542
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,880
Bye.

543
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,760
Mom! Oh God.
Oh God!

544
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,380
- ls she all right?
- Ginny!

545
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,460
Oh my God!

546
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,720
Put her head back.
Let me check her airway.

547
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,570
Go.

548
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,570
I'll tell you one thing, and I'm
not ashamed to say it,

549
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,610
my estimation
of John Sacrimoni as a man

550
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,070
just fucking plummeted.

551
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,080
Give him a break,
will ya?

552
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,080
It's an emotional day.

553
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,650
To cry like a woman?
It's a fucking disgrace.

554
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,550
His fucking coach
turned into a pumpkin.

555
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,810
Well, even Cinderella
didn't cry.

556
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,320
When it comes to daughters,
all bets are off.

557
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I've seen tougher guys
than John cry at weddings.

558
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,650
Well, let me
ask you this--

559
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,800
If they can make him cry
and if he's that weak,

560
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,930
what the fuck else
can they make him do?

561
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,300
I gotta agree
with Phil, Ton'.

562
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,940
Oh, you do, do you?

563
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,600
Terrible out there, huh?
Poor guy.

564
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,040
He's an emotional man.
He loves his daughter.

565
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,270
I want to give you
a home, take care of you.

566
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,010
Love you.

567
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,620
Oh, Steve.

568
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,720
You don't know me.

569
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,750
I still love...

570
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,990
Where are you going?

571
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,630
- I gotta make some collections.
- Now?

572
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,130
- I thought you were sick.
- Go to bed.

573
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,000
I'll see you later.

574
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,640
Maybe too much.

575
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,710
Don't think
I want any less.

576
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,240
Do you love me?

577
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,740
I think I do.

578
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,130
We have been
very lucky, Tony.

579
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,700
The house, the kids,

580
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,340
what we just went through
at the hospital.

581
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,030
You make
your own luck in life.

582
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,850
I'll stop by tomorrow.

583
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,070
What do you got
for me, Nicky?

584
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,640
Let met get my wallet.

585
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,210
Fucking skeeve,
this shit.

586
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,030
What's a guy gotta do
to buy you a drink?

587
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,360
You just did it.

588
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,200
Vito?

589
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,100
What the fuck?

590
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,080
- Sal, hey.
- Fuck you doing?

591
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,910
Nothing. I was here.
It's a joke.

592
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,350
- You're a fucking fag?
- Watch it, buddy.

593
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,420
You fucking watch it,
cupcake.

594
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,450
- Guys, come on. It's okay.
- You think so?

595
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,680
Sal, please,
it's a fucking joke.

596
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,090
Right, sure.
Say hi to your wife.

597
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,430
I'm serious.
I'm-- Sal, please.

598
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,370
Don't say nothing, Sal!

599
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,470
Fuck those jerks.
What do you care what they think?

600
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,840
What? Leave me
the fuck alone.

601
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,320
- Honey.
- Go back to sleep.

602
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,400
I'm gonna
take a shower.

603
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,670
- Hello.
- ls Sil there?

604
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,810
Vito Spatafore.

605
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,210
- Hello.
- What do you know? What do you say?

606
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,040
What do I know?
What do I say?

607
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,810
It's three o-fucking clock.
ls Tony all right?

608
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,460
That's why I'm calling you.
Checking in.

609
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,960
Last I saw,
he was having dessert.

610
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,420
All right, then.

611
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,000
- Everything else okay?
- Yeah.

612
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,630
Call me on my cell,
you need anything.

613
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,320
The point is they made me
take off my shoes,

614
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,320
and I nearly passed out in front
of everybody trying to bend over.

615
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,190
- Well, that's not good.
- People misinterpret.

616
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,700
They think you're weak,
they see an opportunity.

617
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,300
They're my friends,

618
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,340
a lot of them, but they're also
fucking jackals.

619
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,030
- Alpha male.
- It's subtle,

620
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,610
but since I been back,
I been noticing certain looks

621
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,110
and people questioning my judgment
where they never did before.

622
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:40,010
Sure, cat's away,
bad habits set in.

623
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,980
In a perfect world

624
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,780
I just relax,

625
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,050
let them think whatever
the fuck they want.

626
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,320
Act as if.

627
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,060
As if you're not
feeling vulnerable.

628
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,430
As if you're
the same old Anthony.

629
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,070
Strong, "I'm sure, "
decisive.

630
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,200
People see only what
you allow them to see.

631
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,180
Yeah, I been thinking
the same thing.

632
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,010
Thanks for the advice.

633
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,850
Glad to be of service.

634
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,010
Bring that.
Come on, come on, come on!

635
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,050
Where you going?

636
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,850
Ho, get the skip
a chair.

637
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,680
I don't want a chair.
I'm fine.

638
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,420
Ton', how you doing?

639
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,990
- What are you weighing these days?
- Don't ask. 265.

640
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,600
Let's go.

641
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,650
Hey, what's up, Ton'?

642
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,410
- Skip.
- Hey, boss.

643
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,760
You talk to Vito?

644
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,060
Huh? I called him two times.
He never called me back.

645
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,000
You try the house?

646
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,100
'Cause he called me
just the other night.

647
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,810
Hungry, T.? You want, I'll have
Bissell fix you a sandwich.

648
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,070
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

649
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,200
What's your
fucking problem?

650
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,460
Huh?

651
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,870
What the fuck
is your problem?

652
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,170
Slamming the goddamn
refrigerator door.

653
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,040
- What? No.
- Are you gonna argue with me now?

654
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,980
I didn't even
open the refrigerator.

655
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,810
The Coke was out
on the counter.

656
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,010
So you are gonna
argue with me, huh, you fucking mutt?

657
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,650
Look, Tony,
I don't wanna--

658
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,060
You don't wanna what?
You don't wanna what?

659
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,630
This fucking guy, huh?

660
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,370
Fucking Philadelphia
lawyer.

661
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,200
Jesus!

662
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,700
- Don't do it!
- No, don't do it!

663
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,110
My arm!

664
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,560
How's that, huh?

665
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,890
You got
anything else to say?

666
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,940
Get up.
