1
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:09,211
- Diary Of A Thin Man. Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.

2
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,421
The devotion that kid shows.

3
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:16,760
I just think of my Marie, the kids,
in that situation, God forbid.

4
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:20,764
My ma, who the fuck would take care of her
if something happens?

5
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,058
Except Sil and you guys.

6
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:32,442
Colombians knock off at noon. Then it's empty.

7
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,155
Manager's unit's down a flight.

8
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,007
- Who's in there?
- Open it.

9
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,480
- What the fuck?
- Get back!

10
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:17,779
- Shoot the prick!
- Get the fuck out of the way!

11
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:28,373
- Cocksucking, miserable Spic shit!
- It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.

12
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:31,793
Jesus, my fucking balls!

13
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,632
The money!

14
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,843
Fuck! My fucking balls!

15
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:43,096
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.

16
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,808
Nothing.

17
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:50,937
- Let's blow. Lot of fucking noise we made.
- Fuck that.

18
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,984
Close the goddamn door!

19
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:13,168
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?

20
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,845
Anthony.

21
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,516
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.

22
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,351
Cugin'.

23
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,478
I'm gonna go ahead.

24
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:37,442
- What's up?
- You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday

25
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,028
trying to buy a gun in the snack shop.

26
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,532
- Who told you that?
- We know how you feel, but you can't do this.

27
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,951
I can't believe you know this. Who told you?

28
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:49,746
If my pops was laying in there shot up,
I'd be thinking the same thing.

29
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,624
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?

30
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:57,337
I'm your uncle. Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.

31
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,673
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.

32
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:02,217
Trust me,
your dad does not want you to get involved.

33
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,054
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.

34
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,723
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.

35
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,476
Fuck your girlfriend more.

36
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,479
You little hothead here!

37
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:38,211
- Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
- What's going on in there?

38
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:42,132
They're on rounds or something,
Dr Plepler and the Indian girl.

39
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,972
- Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
- Your sweater?

40
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:54,060
- Man, Jesus, fuck!
- All right, take it easy. What is your problem?

41
00:05:54,102 --> 00:06:00,066
I'm old enough to sit with Dad, bring shit from
the house, but too young for the larger issues?

42
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,880
Din lilla hetsporre.

43
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:31,659
- Parkerade du vid akuten eller i garaget?
- Vad hÃ¤nder dÃ¤r inne?

44
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,494
God, he was in such a good mood
this morning.

45
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,960
I told the nurse I thought
he moved his eyebrows at around 5.30.

46
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,339
Did she pass that along?
If not, I'm gonna be furious.

47
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,385
Mrs Soprano, you're gonna have to recalibrate
your expectations at this point.

48
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,181
We can't even maintain his blood pressure
at a level that we'd like.

49
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,851
Until his fever dissipates
and his white cell count comes down,

50
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,522
we're a long way from home,
but he's really fighting.

51
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:48,365
Mom, he's really strong.

52
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,909
That is true.

53
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,083
Hi, Dad.

54
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,369
Monastery?

55
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,818
I...

56
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:10,238
I received these this morning.

57
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:17,996
- Do I really look that much like this guy?
- To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.

58
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:23,502
All right, look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.

59
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:28,048
But I am kind of worried about
what I might have done.

60
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:34,429
- Because, you see, yesterday...
- Tell us. There's no fraud without a fairy tale.

61
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,058
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

62
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,103
- My.
- And I'm in this strange city and...

63
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,523
Please, come inside.

64
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:53,990
I came here because I thought
you could help me reach Finnerty.

65
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:58,120
I have his wallet, I have his briefcase,
but I'm not him.

66
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,375
Excuse the brothers for laughing.

67
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:08,171
One day we will all die
and then we'll be the same as that tree.

68
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,966
No me, no you.

69
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,718
Be that as it may, we need heat.

70
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,222
We need to find someone
who will take responsibility.

71
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,475
- I can't do that.
- Then the lawsuit proceeds.

72
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,616
Go home and I'll stay.

73
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:39,202
I just had Chinese food.

74
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,211
- Carmela?
- Dr Melfi, hi. How are you?

75
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,840
- How are you, is more the point.
- I'm running around crazy.

76
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:58,013
My son was supposed to get coffee or tell
the maid to. It's the one thing I have to have.

77
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:00,140
I got your note. It was so thoughtful.

78
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,436
I've been calling the hospital
and they say that Anthony's stabilised.

79
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,273
- That's what they say.
- If you or anyone needs anything,

80
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:12,694
to talk or to run interference with the doctors,
don't hesitate to call.

81
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,073
I appreciate that. Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.

82
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:20,660
Of course. Good luck.

83
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,879
- Morning, Gab. Is he ready?
- He's eating.

84
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,049
- We're picking up Mrs S at ten.
- I saw her Tuesday.

85
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:38,053
- How's she holding up, poor thing?
- Not so hotso, really.

86
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,347
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

87
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,478
Hear about the thing
in the old neighbourhood?

88
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,271
I'm not busy enough for all this?

89
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:53,360
Couple of guys left three on the floor
in some Colombian laundry.

90
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,570
Thank you.

91
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,952
- Two guys we know?
- Total bloodbath.

92
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:06,998
- Somebody said a million plus. What a score!
- Fuckin' A.

93
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,877
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.

94
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,588
Listen, don't forget...

95
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,133
Honey, your asthma kicking up?

96
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,428
Springtime. Pollen's out of control.

97
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:25,475
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss?

98
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:29,146
- I hoped the day would never come.
- You've always sold yourself short.

99
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:32,482
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.

100
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,945
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece,
enjoy some grandkids.

101
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:40,824
How many guys could step into Tony's shoes
and do the job you're doing?

102
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,286
- You think?
- You have such strength in crisis.

103
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,413
Benny feels honoured to drive you.

104
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,417
You're firm about what you want
without being obnoxious about it.

105
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:58,049
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if,
God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?

106
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,391
- Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
- And?

107
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,812
I'm gonna tell you something
I never told anybody.

108
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:16,234
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated
the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.

109
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,737
- Not Tony, me.
- Really?

110
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,992
- Yeah, but I thought, "It's not for me."
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it?

111
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:28,497
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes.

112
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,250
Advice, strategy.

113
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,962
But here you are, Sil.

114
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:40,592
The times make the man, honey,
not the other way around.

115
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,181
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's other ancillary...

116
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:50,644
- No change with Tony.
- Carmela's in goddamn pieces.

117
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:54,189
Memo.
Get some coffee up to Carmela's house.

118
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,361
Bobby was making collections
up in Roseville again last night.

119
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:03,365
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.

120
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:15,710
- How's the skip doing?
- Same. You forget something? Like my cut.

121
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:20,507
Can you believe this guy? Lose weight on
that nose. Keep it out of everybody's business.

122
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,634
I'm working on it.

123
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:29,724
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.

124
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,233
That was Junior's neighbourhood
so now it's mine.

125
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,610
Keep your voice down here.

126
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,613
It was Eugene's for three years
and he was with me.

127
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,950
He should've never had it,
except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.

128
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,663
- Junior ruled on it and it wasn't right then.
- This fucking guy!

129
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,248
Easy.

130
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,834
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.

131
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,171
Maybe that's what that he admitted to you.
I heard five.

132
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,506
You heard wrong.

133
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,593
What do we do here, Sil?

134
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,264
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?

135
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:13,101
For the time being, it's Bobby's,

136
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,938
but he's still gonna kick up to you 20%

137
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,357
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah.

138
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:25,781
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now. We'll see how much is there.

139
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,955
Hi, everyone. My God, you poor thing.

140
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,958
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.

141
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,467
Good morning.

142
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,357
Another one?

143
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,533
- Know what I found out yesterday?
- What's that?

144
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,080
Thank you.

145
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,707
I was diagnosed, actually...

146
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,337
with Alzheimer's.

147
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,506
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

148
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:31,179
Well, my uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.

149
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,890
Someone's probably studying that.

150
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,358
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?

151
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,695
All right, I'll stop.

152
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,008
Sil?

153
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,426
What?

154
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,179
Heard about this Orange Street takedown?

155
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,849
- The Colombians? That you?
- My guy had the tip.

156
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:01,520
- Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
- Everybody?

157
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:07,359
Carmela. She gets T's cut under
the circumstances, correct? It's your call.

158
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,694
I know it's my fucking call.

159
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,992
Yes, that is the correct thing.

160
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,412
Ladies' room's next door!

161
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,289
I can reach it from here!

162
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,959
Grim fucking scene, that ICU.

163
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,461
She's one brave lady.

164
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,340
I was just saying,
I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.

165
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,467
- Of the thing.
- Back up, Bluto.

166
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,055
- Your half? I did all the heavy lifting.
- You'd have never heard about it without me!

167
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,559
Big help. It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.

168
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,562
Doc says I need an ultrasound
on my groin and balls.

169
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,064
Sil. You wanna weigh in here?

170
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:55,657
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.

171
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,910
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.

172
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,747
80K? How's that 20% of a million?

173
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,792
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.

174
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,503
Fuck it all, Paulie, Tommy cased that shithole!

175
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:13,842
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece. You got it?

176
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,136
We're looking after Carmela.

177
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,638
- No question.
- Of course.

178
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,224
Sooner than later, Paulie.

179
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,728
I gotta piss first. You want half of that, too?

180
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:34,529
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on,

181
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,699
blow 20 residuals at the track.

182
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,327
As writers,

183
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,497
we are all hung up.

184
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:49,085
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.

185
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,631
We mythologise our inner narrative.

186
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,218
Take, for example, Beowulf.

187
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,680
Who is Grendel? But the habit, the disease...

188
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,643
Fresh casualties
in the battle of the blank page!

189
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,562
Welcome to the Writers' Guild. Have a seat.

190
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,649
Take me.

191
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,402
My past as an addict...

192
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,825
Get the fuck up! Come on!

193
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,375
Give me that fucking fisheye!
I'm offering you a way to wipe your obligation!

194
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:34,297
- I didn't tell you to start gambling again!
- I can't write a feature. I just landed a staff job.

195
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,009
People are seeing huge profits
with these digital horror movies.

196
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,095
Douchebags who never made a film before.

197
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,014
That Saw thing, 400 grand to make,

198
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,684
took in 100 mil worldwide.

199
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:51,398
I'm 100% well?
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?

200
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,027
You hear this dude? "100% well."
He's a bad boy, with that lingo?

201
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,447
Real fucking dark character.

202
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,326
My idea is Saw meets Godfather II.

203
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,830
Proven track record, both genres.

204
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,833
Young wiseguy, assassin,
gets betrayed by his people.

205
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,045
They whack him, leave his body parts
in dumpsters all around the city.

206
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:19,134
Long story short, he is put back together
by science or maybe it's supernatural.

207
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,554
And he gets fucking payback
on everyone who fucked him over,

208
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,473
including the cunt he was engaged to.

209
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,643
She was getting porked by his boss
the night the hero was killed.

210
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,607
We'll have a meeting tomorrow. We'll hear
what you fleshed out before we go to script.

211
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:37,235
Bing, 2.30. Don't make me come look for you.

212
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:01,051
An entire room full of writers
and you did nothing!

213
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,061
- Sir, it's family only in the unit.
- I'll be out of your hair in a minute.

214
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,314
I'm gonna have to call
the hospital administrator.

215
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:29,204
There's a major package coming your way
from Paulie and Vito. Very significant.

216
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,957
You all have done so much already.

217
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,629
We just found out insurance won't pay for
physical therapy. Bastards! So thank you.

218
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,133
You wanna come in, say hello?

219
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,095
Sure.

220
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,323
Hello, Father.

221
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,345
I have Napoleons,
but I also got fruit for a certain party.

222
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,975
Either's good. The programme says sugar
after meals tells the body you're full.

223
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,605
When you married my cousin, everybody
used to say you looked like John Travolta.

224
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,275
He's almost back to his white suit!

225
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,701
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.

226
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,163
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed
on you. It's not my style.

227
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,416
He's worried more about Carmela
than the fucking earners.

228
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,879
Please. With Johnny awaiting trial
and the feds freezing his assets,

229
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,048
who's keeping Ginny in Butter Brickle?

230
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,135
Lucky for me,
those last years I was in the can,

231
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,388
my kid brother Billy
took care of Patty and the grandkids.

232
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,853
Only to have that motherfucking animal
Blundetto...

233
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,272
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.

234
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,068
It's hard to forget.

235
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,154
I don't forget.

236
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,250
- I forget what we were talking about.
- Me, too. What the fuck was it?

237
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,420
Yeah, Jesus. Carmela. The thing is...

238
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,800
- You want coffee, cuz?
- If you're already making it.

239
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,636
Hot water and lemon, hon.

240
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,348
Honestly...

241
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,685
how can I short Carmela?

242
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,189
- Maybe I'm not following you.
- I'm as supportive as the next guy.

243
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,485
But there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?

244
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,948
I'm gonna hand her $100,000
and he dies the next day?

245
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,037
- Be money down the drain.
- It's tempting, but you can't think that way.

246
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,794
You all set now?

247
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,589
Yeah, I'm living it up here.

248
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,342
Still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.

249
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,970
I'll never get over it.

250
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,391
- Certain people, let me tell you...
- Come on, not Sil again.

251
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:43,064
Carmela. He's a fucking vegetable. But I still
gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.

252
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,234
- The boss's wife. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.

253
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,168
I'm on my way in now.

254
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,298
- And take care of that thing we talked about.
- Which thing?

255
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,219
That big piece of pie you were bringing
to the hospital. Make it happen.

256
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,014
- What are you worried about?
- I know who I'm fucking dealing with.

257
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,267
- I resent that.
- You have a problem taking orders from me?

258
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,728
Keep your shirt on. It's done.

259
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:35,617
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.

260
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,540
That was my daughter. I can't help but think
that physical affection means something.

261
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,764
They refrigerate this place?

262
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,151
There you go.

263
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,750
- What are you still doing out there?
- I got involved in a lawsuit.

264
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,211
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.

265
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,338
What kind of lawsuit?

266
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,425
Hello?

267
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,261
- Also...
- What?

268
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:40,724
- I had an accident. I fell down some stairs.
- My God

269
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,684
The doctor said...

270
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,772
What did he say?

271
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,108
Mild concussion, he said.

272
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,820
- Told me I'd be OK.
- That's it, I'm coming out there.

273
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,284
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.

274
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,454
No, don't do that.

275
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,332
Are you telling me everything?

276
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:24,392
I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi,
my co-executive producer on the project.

277
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:29,481
Nice to finally meet. I heard titbits of what
Chris has in mind, the genre and so forth.

278
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:35,153
But, JT, I gotta warn you, I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.

279
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:41,326
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting
of possible investors on this project.

280
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,913
Some of you know I've had nine pictures
under my subspecies.

281
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:51,336
Four in the South Beach Strumpet series
alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.

282
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,549
I usually find it helpful at this stage
to include my prospective partners

283
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,470
and get your inputs, or notes, as we call them.

284
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,764
JT, you're on.

285
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,309
Well...

286
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,689
we've been working on
a new kind of slasher film.

287
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,568
It takes place in the world of... you know...

288
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,738
the Mafia.

289
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,117
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth
and bigger dreams.

290
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,664
Anyway, they call him The Butcher and...

291
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,791
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?

292
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,378
Need I remind you
of a certain butcher out of AC?

293
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,882
Right. Not Butcher. Go on, JT.

294
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,593
So, right...

295
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,554
He's kind of outshining his boss.

296
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:47,350
So the guy has him clipped,
but he's still alive when they cut him up.

297
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,644
He's gonna feel that the next day!

298
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,401
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself.

299
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:01,656
All except for a hand that got crushed
so he ties a cleaver onto the stump

300
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,993
and he goes out to get revenge on everyone,

301
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:09,164
especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.

302
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:14,127
Right now it's called Pork Store Killer,
but I'm thinking...

303
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,338
just...

304
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,006
Cleaver.

305
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:26,306
- I'm confused. You said he's dead.
- How's he evening up with anybody?

306
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:31,353
- He's a ghost?
- As I understood, a zombie of sorts.

307
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,480
Great title, by the way.

308
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,692
But if they jointed him,
he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.

309
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,779
- How's that a slasher film?
- What are you talkin' about?

310
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:46,952
The slasher. Couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.

311
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,247
Actually, the maniac is almost always
a supernatural force.

312
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,084
- Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers.
- Get the fuck out!

313
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,254
Easy, Sil, easy. He's making a point.

314
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:02,717
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy - different kind of movie.

315
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,388
That's the kind we're doing here.
Saw, The Ring, they made millions.

316
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,641
That's not including the Godfather angle,
which we got here.

317
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,894
What if...

318
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:20,735
they disposed him at stops
that happened to be along the same route?

319
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,699
Then he would all end up in the same dump.

320
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,369
But he's a ghost? I don't know.

321
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,164
Ghostbusters.
Another fucking money machine!

322
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,463
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni. Again.

323
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,968
It's got bÄÂ©chamel on it so five, six hours
out of the fridge, tops.

324
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,679
- Thank you.
- Howdy.

325
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,811
Look at her. That word plucky,
is that what it means?

326
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,147
When do I get to spend time with the skip?

327
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,816
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.

328
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,195
...in this mob family domestic shooting,
which some observers note

329
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,614
carries echoes of the death of...

330
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,828
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Junior
himself told our Amy Kean...

331
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:17,125
"Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."

332
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,338
- You just wanna bite it!
- Big Lots! What's your deal today?

333
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,048
Carmela?

334
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,847
- I swear, I'll fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?

335
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,143
You made a fool of yourself and our family
on national fucking television?

336
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,563
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.

337
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:43,151
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did. That's what they do!

338
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,697
Which is why I and everybody else told you,
don't talk to the press!

339
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:52,077
You're the one who looked like a total asshole,
dragging me around like I was five!

340
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,456
You're a cross to bear, that's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody!

341
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,459
Fuck this! All right, fuck it all!

342
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:07,509
- Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

343
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,053
- What's wrong with me?
- Mom...

344
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,726
Had to happen. She's fried.

345
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,081
You have any extra compensation
for what you've been going through?

346
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,584
Nah, part of the job.

347
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:46,256
Like they say, "with great power
comes great responsibility."

348
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,886
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.

349
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,429
Really?

350
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,475
Slip of the tongue, no doubt,
but I noticed he didn't correct himself.

351
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,727
See?

352
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,314
If it did become permanent,
your compensation might be...

353
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,024
Don't go there.

354
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,073
Hi, Gab. I need Sil for a second.

355
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,951
Can you keep it short? He's pretty beat.

356
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,164
This better be important, Bobby.

357
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:24,294
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.

358
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:29,174
It's 9.30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.

359
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,969
Roseville, this temporary shit,
I need an answer already!

360
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,306
I'm going out of my fucking mind!
I'm liable to do something drastic!

361
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,226
Calm the fuck down. Let me think.

362
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,359
Mornings are better.

363
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:52,781
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.

364
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,749
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket
the other day.

365
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,752
See, you're Tony's therapist.

366
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:10,257
- Whether it's appropriate...
- How can I help you?

367
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,052
It's about my son.

368
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,138
Well, both kids, really.

369
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,015
The situation...

370
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,103
with the shooting,
I'm very worried about them.

371
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,688
Sure.

372
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,942
It's a very serious problem.

373
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,695
You know, guns in the home.

374
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,156
It's a societal concern.

375
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,659
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.

376
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:43,915
I removed all the firearms from the house
after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.

377
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:49,504
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son...

378
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,718
and I said something...
I said something very cruel.

379
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,224
And especially since he's been trying so hard.

380
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,311
How are you doing?

381
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,193
You know, I'm frazzled, certainly,
but I am more worried about them.

382
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,361
They're not kids any more.

383
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:18,033
When they were young, there were certain
things we could tell them about Tony's life.

384
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,203
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.

385
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,875
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.

386
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:38,261
I think about my son in front of those cameras,
having to vouch for all of this.

387
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:45,644
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.

388
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,647
They do or you do?

389
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,236
The minute I met Tony,
I knew who that guy was.

390
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:57,906
On my second date, he brought me
and my mother each a dozen roses

391
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,575
and my father a $200 power drill.

392
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,288
Not the typical story of young love.

393
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,586
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it...

394
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,425
or because of it.

395
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,388
My parents weren't like that.

396
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,726
And I knew, whether consciously or not,
I knew that behind that power drill,

397
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:31,189
there was probably some guy
with a broken arm, you know, or worse.

398
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,068
And you coped with that, how?

399
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,781
I'd go to my priest and I would cry

400
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:44,035
and say how bad I felt about how my husband
made his money, but that was bullshit.

401
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,291
Because there are far bigger crooks
than my husband.

402
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,048
But the kids,

403
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,552
they don't decide who they're born to.

404
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,015
So now what?

405
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,352
Yeah, that's just it. Now what?

406
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,857
It's all out in the open now,
the whole thing.

407
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:18,570
And them, they're not in grade school
any more, they become...

408
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,490
The longer they stay with us...

409
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,659
Complicit.

410
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,412
God.

411
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,757
Putting aside the moral and legal issues...

412
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,386
clarity can't be a bad thing.

413
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,097
Yes.

414
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:56,233
Tony's second night in the coma,
I told him I loved him.

415
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,862
When was the last time I said that?

416
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:12,791
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way
when he wakes up?

417
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,925
Anthony tells me things have been...
better between you.

418
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,687
- Can't breathe.
- It's OK, honey. You're gonna be OK.

419
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,314
I can't breathe.

420
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,818
- It's all right.
- Can't breathe.

421
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,778
Can't breathe, can't breathe!

422
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,535
It's OK, honey. You're gonna be OK.

423
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,415
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?

424
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,042
Sil, I didn't hear from you.

425
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:04,176
- Sil's on the canvas now.
- Fucking 100% disaster.

426
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:08,597
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it,

427
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,392
somebody's
gonna have to step into the breach.

428
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,519
I'm a young man

429
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,606
and now, without the weight,

430
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,150
I'm a healthy man

431
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,277
with longevity.

432
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,582
I hear Sil is at St Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?

433
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,168
Sil's gonna be fine. You have enough worries.

434
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,799
Listen, sweetheart, I know you're expecting
something and I can't get into specifics,

435
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,342
Tony wouldn't want me to.

436
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,554
But certain people
are looking over our shoulders right now.

437
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:53,141
It's OK, Vito, I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.

438
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,812
Like you said, I got bigger worries.
Like this son of mine.

439
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,190
You gotta trust me on this, hon.

440
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,985
Suspicions get raised if we were
to move it to you at this moment.

441
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,239
I got this.

442
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,408
Your ma says now's our moment.

443
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,830
The main thing, when people come to sit
with Dad, the doctors want positive talk.

444
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,124
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.

445
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,756
- He looks terrible!
- Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.

446
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:29,761
- We have to stay positive.
- Yeah, it's just, nothing prepares you for that.

447
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,888
Uncle Paulie!

448
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,642
Only one person at a time, please.

449
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,188
She's a ballbuster.

450
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,442
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, OK?

451
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,569
Remember, stay positive.

452
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:15,056
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.

453
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:23,231
Course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.

454
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,739
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it
doing a major piece of business.

455
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:36,244
I saw a little action and the next thing,
I was at the urologist.

456
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,083
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect
the same things from my body no more.

457
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,253
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.

458
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:49,424
Next you find out you can't take pissing
for granted. Some joke, huh?

459
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:56,014
When I was in the service,
I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.

460
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:58,308
Fucking beautiful definition, too!

461
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,311
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.

462
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:05,524
He was half a fag,
but I was flattered just the same.

463
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:09,903
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.

464
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,952
You don't think it's gonna happen to you,
but I'm feeling it, Tone.

465
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:27,420
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.

466
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,590
Hey, Vito, how's Mr Soprano doing?

467
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,884
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?

468
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,104
I'm so glad you're here.

469
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:47,023
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.

470
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,407
That... Don't worry about him. He's harmless.

471
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:01,830
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?

472
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:07,169
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Stand-up one day, FBI rat-fuck the next.

473
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,215
I felt it here, T. I felt it right here.

474
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,342
Will you please shut up in there?

475
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,346
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,474
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.

477
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,145
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?

478
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,065
Out towards the beacon.

479
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,778
What is that beacon, anyway?

480
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,701
God damn it! Shut up! Shut up in...

481
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:42,788
So I said to Ma...

482
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,041
What the fuck?

483
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,590
Dr Budraja, stat to room three.

484
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,468
Nurse, don't leave! Help!

485
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,223
- Out of the way, sir.
- My God, what's happening?

486
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,269
- V-tach on the monitor. Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.

487
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,272
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.

488
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:13,819
My God, is he dying? Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening!

489
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,905
- One, two, three.
- Dr Budraja, stat.

490
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,451
- My God!
- Still V-tach at 210.

491
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,079
150 mg of amiodaraone.

492
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,249
Grab the paddles. Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.

493
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,043
- Dad!
- Stand back.

494
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,753
- Daddy!
- All clear.

495
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,630
Clear.

496
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,926
- 200.
- Stand back.

497
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,595
- All clear.
- Clear.

498
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:37,944
- Excuse me. Is this the Finnerty reunion?
- Hello, there. They're waiting for you.

499
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,238
- Me?
- Of course.

500
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,077
- Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
- We don't talk like that.

501
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:50,248
- What do you mean?
- Your family's inside.

502
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:55,921
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.

503
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,175
- I don't understand.
- You're going home.

504
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,177
I am?

505
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,818
Everyone's in there.

506
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,953
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.

507
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:33,875
I lost my real briefcase.

508
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,836
My whole life was in it.

509
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,256
Don't go, Daddy.

510
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,929
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.

511
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:49,850
- No, no, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.

512
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,978
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.

513
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,398
Well, you need to. You need to let go.

514
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,651
We love you, Daddy. Don't leave us.

515
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,498
For some reason...

516
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,835
- I'm scared.
- Nothing to be scared of.

517
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,173
You can let it go.

518
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,718
Just come say hello.

519
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:28,263
All right.

520
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,435
Daddy!

521
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:39,524
Please don't leave us, Daddy. We love you.

522
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:53,830
Dad?

523
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,541
His eyes are open.

524
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,711
Daddy, look at me right here.

525
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,881
- Normal sinus rhythm. Pulse and pressure?
- Good.

526
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,258
My God! Thank God. Thank God!

527
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:11,389
Hang an amiodaraone drip
and send off a set of electrolytes now.

528
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,809
Dad, look, here you are.

529
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:22,400
So I'm holding his hand
and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit!

530
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,822
- You told us, for Christ's sake.
- Those fucking doctors, it's their fault...

531
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,741
Skip's gonna make it, he's conscious!

532
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,995
Thank God!

533
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,437
I got it, honey.

534
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:04,818
- What the fuck took you so long?
- I had to get it together, didn't I?

535
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:13,160
- We gotta get that cut to her now.
- Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.

536
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,204
Tony's conscious. You capisce?

537
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:20,584
Everybody and his mother was talking to him
when he was in that coma. Carmela.

538
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:25,380
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.

539
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:27,340
Jesus Christ.

540
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:36,266
He can't talk yet because of
the tube that was in his throat.

541
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:39,186
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky!

542
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,107
But we are very happy, aren't we?

543
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,778
Anthony, you had us so worried.

544
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,114
I haven't been to church that much
since I quit playing bingo!

545
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,495
What, honey?

546
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,624
I'm dead, right?

547
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,294
No.

548
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:07,214
No, you're in the hospital with all of us.

549
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,508
In Newark.

550
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:14,054
Mr Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr Vahapsideh. I'm a neurologist.

551
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:24,648
- How's he doing, sweetheart?
- Not out of the woods, but he's hanging in.

552
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,860
He just passed his first
simple mental acuity test, so...

553
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,863
Your strength, that was the difference.

554
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,161
A little something from us.

555
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:44,459
- Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
- Jesus, I don't know what to say.

556
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:48,338
- This is what we do, honey.
- I'd want the same for my Marie.

557
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,298
Or my ma.

558
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,392
We're here if you need anything.

559
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,828
Great fucking news, T.

560
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,875
To see you up and around.

561
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,172
The best.

562
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,144
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself...

563
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:49,274
"and all the while,
a great wind carries me across the sky.

564
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:53,403
"Ojibwe saying." Indians, right?

565
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,201
Who put this up?

566
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,625
Listen, T,
something I wanted to talk to you about.

567
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,759
I'm gonna take another run
at the movie business.

568
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:23,850
I know you haven't liked that in the past,
but I'm going about it in a whole different way.

569
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:27,020
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor

570
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:31,650
when you feel better and I can explain
what we're doing. It's pretty exciting.

571
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:35,070
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it. It means negative.

572
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:41,868
I'm holding a large ownership position
open for you.

573
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,996
I hope you approve.

574
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,084
Actually...

575
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,672
frankly... all due respect...

576
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,925
I think you owe me this.

577
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:01,096
Because I came to you about Adriana.

578
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:04,099
- You've got him up?
- I know how it looks.

579
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:07,018
But he should be upright as much as possible.

580
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:11,022
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.

581
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,490
I don't know how you do it.

582
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,551
That's gotta feel good, huh?

583
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,804
The simple things.
