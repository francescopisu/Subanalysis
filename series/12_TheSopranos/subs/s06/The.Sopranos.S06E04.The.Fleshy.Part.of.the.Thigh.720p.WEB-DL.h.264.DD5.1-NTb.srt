1
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,670
I'll be as fast as I can.

2
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,480
Jesus Christ.
I'll never get used to seeing that.

3
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,650
Won't have to
much longer.

4
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,080
Got you scheduled
for surgery tomorrow.

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,120
Finally close you up.

6
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,260
- More surgery?
- It's a good sign.

7
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,720
Dr. Plepler doesn't think
he'll need access anymore.

8
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,230
Watch it with
the morphine, now.

9
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,670
Beautiful thought.
Who put that up?

10
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,610
My sister.
Who else?

11
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,250
Why you keep it up there
if you don't find it inspirational?

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,580
My daughter likes it.

13
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,080
Everybody keeps telling me
how lucky I am.

14
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,620
You are. Septic shock?
As long as you were out?

15
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,450
Attending staff
gave you 20 to one.

16
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,960
You read the paper?

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,630
My own uncle
puts me through this.

18
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,600
New gunshot.
Rapper. Da Lux.

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,970
He's hot. Got shot seven times
coming out of a club.

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,740
He's still got
all his pancreas, though.

21
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,310
All done.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,510
Fiona.

23
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,920
Look,
I've been feeling...

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,750
I don't know,

25
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,990
not myself,

26
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,820
since I woke up
from the coma.

27
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,100
My thoughts keep
running away with me.

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,300
These feelings?
They'll pass.

29
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,340
It's very common
in post-surgical patients.

30
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,910
Maybe you'd like to talk to someone.
Social worker?

31
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,930
Hey, babe, how ya feeling?

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh, good, good.

33
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,630
That candy striper
out there,

34
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,530
there's not much
of a selection.

35
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,030
There was something on "Sink the
Bismarck, " but half the pages were gone.

36
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,830
But you like dinosaurs.

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,170
Having surgery tomorrow.

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
They say they're
closing me up.

39
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,760
Gus!

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,770
Jason, my condolences.

41
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Your dad was the best boss
any of us ever had.

42
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:45,989
Jag vill gÃ¶ra nÃ¥gra fÃ¶rÃ¤ndringar,
men hans kontor Ã¤r fullt av skrÃ¤p.

43
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,087
Det ligger en utombordare
pÃ¥ hans skrivbord.

44
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,630
We're paying
an Anthony Soprano

45
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,180
the second-highest salary
in the company.

46
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,850
He's a consultant.

47
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,850
Where do I reach him?

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,850
I want to make some changes,
but his office is full of junk.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,250
There's a 55-horse
Johnson outboard on the desk.

50
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,260
Looks like nobody's
ever there.

51
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,590
He's in the hospital.

52
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,560
You should talk
to his colleague, Mr. Gaultieri.

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,060
Paulie?

54
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,170
Oh, Tony Soprano.
Of course.

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,930
I knew him when I was a kid.
He was a friend of the family.

56
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to eat!

57
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,280
You fucking
believe this?

58
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,180
Always something.

59
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,180
So anyway, she was crying
the entire night

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,380
and I didn't get
any sleep.

61
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,420
Why don't you ride on the fucking
zephyrs and sleep on a cloud?

62
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,290
What, you think
I put that up there?

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,430
- I didn't.
- Right.

64
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,690
Who then?

65
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,560
Hello. I can't hear--

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah-- talk louder!

67
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,010
Nanny.

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,580
Between the reception
and her language skills...

69
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,360
I suppose you got a little
choo-choo train at home, huh?

70
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,090
Takes your toast right from the kitchen,
delivers it to your bedroom?

71
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,020
Look, Ton'-- I'm sorry
about what happened

72
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,600
with Junior
and the shooting, but--

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,030
Don't mention Junior
to me ever again.

74
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll tell you this, Bobby--

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,700
You can't hide behind
this brother-in-law shit forever.

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,540
You're an okay guy,
but each and every man

77
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,610
is judged
on his own merit.

78
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,920
- Have you heard the good news?
- Jesus Christ!

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,930
That's right.

80
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,000
Aaron Arkaway,
Jan's friend.

81
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,860
Oh yeah, right.

82
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,300
We're protesting
downstairs and...

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,200
I saw Jan in the elevator
this morning.

84
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,670
She told me
you were up here.

85
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,540
That's what all
that yelling and singing is?

86
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,270
The druggist from the hospital
pharmacy was fired

87
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,010
for refusing
to fill birth control prescriptions.

88
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,020
We're trying
to get his job back.

89
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,690
Tony, this is our prayer leader,
Bob Brewster.

90
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,660
Hi, Aaron's told me
a lot about you.

91
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,560
I thought we'd come up
and pray with you.

92
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,490
- Bottom feeding, huh?
- It's where the big fish are.

93
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,830
Son of a fuckin' bitch!

94
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,810
They cut my morphine,

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,470
trying to wean me off.

96
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,910
You know, I've seen people delivered
from unbelievable pain...

97
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,640
myself included.

98
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,750
- Oh yeah?
- I was at rock bottom.

99
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,190
I was addicted
to cocaine and strippers.

100
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,920
Then I lost my wife
and I crashed my car, drunk.

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,570
Ended up upside down, hanging
by my seat belt, completely terrified.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,700
Then I prayed
for God to save me.

103
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,200
- And He came in.
- Praise Him.

104
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,030
And in that moment,
I was reborn.

105
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,470
And I see you there
and I know you're hurting.

106
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,580
And the answer is to accept the Lord
as your personal Savior.

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,750
Well I got all this covered, you know,
with my parish priest.

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,710
That's great,
but what God wants

109
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,890
is for you
to love Him directly,

110
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
not necessarily through
the intercession of liturgy

111
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,230
or any human agent.

112
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,890
ls this
Aaron Arkaway?

113
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
- Hey.
- What are you fellas doing here?

114
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
Mrs. Soprano.

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,130
We were just dialoguing
with your husband.

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,460
We were about to pray.

117
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,260
- They were.
- You're having surgery tomorrow.

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,970
You know they've done clinical
studies about the power of prayer.

119
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,580
Prayed-for patients
have 11% fewer complications.

120
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,870
I have read that.
It does help to pray.

121
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,610
I mean even if it just
takes your mind off it.

122
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,810
Dear Jesus...

123
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,120
hear these words
and bestow Your loving, healing grace

124
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,520
upon our injured friend.
Lord, help heal his wounds

125
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,990
and help him with
Your cleansing love.

126
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,320
Where sin abounds,

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,590
grace abounds even more.

128
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,100
Amen.

129
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,710
- Amen.
- Amen.

130
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,430
Amen.

131
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,710
So, Reverend,
let me, uh--

132
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,510
let me ask you about
this guy not selling birth control.

133
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,160
He should be free
to exercise his moral convictions

134
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,290
without suffering
loss of livelihood.

135
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,490
Well here's
what I'm getting at-- I'm-- I'm...

136
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,190
I'm worried
about Viagra.

137
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,160
The way I see it,
I'm gonna need plenty of that,

138
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,030
considering
my condition and...

139
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,640
what if somebody decides that Viagra
is wrong and God don't like it?

140
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,750
Well, God loves
procreation.

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,710
No one's saying
anything against Viagra.

142
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,910
Birth control in the name
of the morning-after pill is a sin

143
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,710
because it strikes
at life, at the unborn.

144
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,890
Yeah but what if somebody
goes after Viagra?

145
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,790
I'm not talking
about procreation

146
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,690
and listen up,
'cause this affects you too.

147
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,930
Something like Viagra
will never be an issue.

148
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Excuse me, but at one time
they were going after booze,

149
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,130
and as a proprietor
of a drinking and eating establishment,

150
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,000
I take this stuff
very seriously.

151
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,970
Strip club,
I believe it is.

152
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,040
- Oh, you've been to the Bing?
- No.

153
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,270
He should rest.

154
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,670
Thank you so much
for coming, Pastor, and Aaron.

155
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,510
Thank you so much
for your prayer.

156
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,950
- Sure.
- Yeah, really I...

157
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,910
- I really appreciate it.
- Bye, guys. Praise God.

158
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,400
- What are you, a wiseass?
- What?

159
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,000
What'd I do?

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,570
- Oh my God.
- What is it, Doctor?

161
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,950
I just found Jimmy Hoffa.

162
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,020
In Montana, the fossilized remains
of a Tyrannosaurus rex

163
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,990
yielded soft tissue that indicated
a definite link

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,530
between dinosaurs
and modern birds.

165
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,530
- Look who I got here.
- Ho, the sanitation prince.

166
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,140
Hi, Tony. I'm sorry
you're not feeling well.

167
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,670
Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.

168
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Your father and I
were very close.

169
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,070
Remember my daughter
Meadow? Jason Barone.

170
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,720
- Hi.
- Hey.

171
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,940
Remember
when you were a kid,

172
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,920
at that field box
at Shea, opening day?

173
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,620
Me, you, your dad
and Paulie here?

174
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,350
Oh yeah. Kingman was
just back from the Cubs.

175
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,530
Mookie Wilson hit that foul tip,
beaned that guy in the loge.

176
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,930
I gotta get to the office.
Finn's picking me up.

177
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,130
- I'll be back later.
- Sweetheart,

178
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,140
thank you
for everything.

179
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,470
Okay. Don't wear him out.

180
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,940
She wants to be a doctor.

181
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,950
Also considering law.

182
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,220
So, you're living
in Deer Valley?

183
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,550
Yeah, ski instructor.

184
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,060
So, Paulie tells me
you're thinking of selling

185
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,730
your father's business
to Chuckie Cinelli.

186
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah, I think it's
the best thing for Mom.

187
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,390
And of course, Tony, there'd be
a severance package for you.

188
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,000
Frankly, Jason,
I don't think

189
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,000
you should sell
the business right now.

190
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,640
There's a lot
of potential buyers out there.

191
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,180
When I get out of the hospital,
run the numbers,

192
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,970
get you
the best price.

193
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,740
No, Cinelli's offer
seemed fair.

194
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,650
There's lots of things
to take into account.

195
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,150
- You even know what your EBITDA is?
- My what?

196
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,920
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization.

197
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,990
Gives the true picture
of a company's profitability.

198
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,230
Jas, you let me
handle this.

199
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,300
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

200
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,530
The carting business--

201
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,570
it's a different
corporate culture.

202
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,270
You're tired, T.
We'll leave. Come on.

203
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,280
All right.
Bye, Tony.

204
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,400
We're afraid
she doesn't have long left.

205
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,260
I'm surprised she
didn't call Ma.

206
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,990
Well she asked specifically
to see you.

207
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,710
Ooh, Madonn'.

208
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,780
Paulie.

209
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,890
Aunt Dottie.
Hold on a sec.

210
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,220
- It's chilly in here.
- I'm burning up. I'm burning up.

211
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,090
I brought you
some pignolis and...

212
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,590
a new pair of those
Speedo skin-diver socks you like.

213
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,100
Look at those.
The treads are all gone.

214
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,290
You slip on the linoleum again,
then where are we?

215
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,100
- Paulie, I gotta tell you--
- Just a sec.

216
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,840
Sister, please
give me a hand here.

217
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,480
Put these
on my aunt, will ya?

218
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,770
Paulie,
you should know...

219
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,480
- Speak up, Aunt Dot.
- I was...

220
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,710
- I was a bad girl.
- How could you be a bad girl?

221
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,920
- You're a nun.
- These are too small.

222
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,960
No they ain't. They're supposed
to be snug so she don't slip.

223
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,260
- Put 'em on.
- Paulie...

224
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,090
During the war,
I was still a novitiate.

225
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,530
I was helping out
at the USO,

226
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,700
and there was
this soldier-- Russ.

227
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,240
And he was
so lonely--

228
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,280
Aunt Dottie,
if this is going where I think,

229
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,040
maybe you should
talk to a priest.

230
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,080
I got pregnant.

231
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,450
- I had a baby.
- A baby?

232
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,420
Listen to her.
The Alzheimer's is gettin' to her.

233
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,680
You didn't have
no baby.

234
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,390
I did.
I did have a baby.

235
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,900
Paulie...
it was you.

236
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,200
You're my son.

237
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,170
But...

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,810
But Ma...?

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,810
Marianuccia is your aunt.

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm your Ma.

241
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,720
I was a bad girl.

242
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,660
Good afternoon, Mr. Soprano.
How are you doing?

243
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,020
- Better now.
- I'm glad to hear that.

244
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,400
Where they been
keepin' you?

245
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,970
The other doctors
around here--

246
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,870
it's like the United Colors
of Benetton.

247
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,010
I'm not a doctor.

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,870
I'm a utilization
review specialist.

249
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,670
I represent
your insurance carrier.

250
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,940
It's my job, together with
your physicians,

251
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,410
to see how fast we can
get you out of this place and back home.

252
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,020
Well this is good.
They've closed your incision

253
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,660
and you're ambulatory
now and I see they got the Foley out.

254
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,230
You wanna kick
me out of here.

255
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,890
Well, a hospital stay
costs a lot of money.

256
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,830
My bowels don't work.
I'm in pain.

257
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,900
I just got operated on,
for Christ's sake.

258
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,200
Perhaps your bowels
would be working better

259
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,270
if you hadn't tried to eat
the sausage sandwich on 3/28.

260
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't believe this. With all the money
I've been contributing

261
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,410
over the years,
you wanna put me in the street.

262
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,710
Look, you think we're the enemy,
but if you hadn't had insurance,

263
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,180
you would have ended up
at the County Hospital.

264
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,080
It's a good thing that you had your
card with you

265
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,380
when they performed
the wallet biopsy.

266
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,560
- The what?
- In the ambulance.

267
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,120
If you hadn't had
your card with you,

268
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,760
they would have dropped your butt
at Martin Luther King.

269
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,000
The "wallet biopsy"?

270
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,030
Get out of my room,
you sick cunt.

271
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,980
You're doing great.

272
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,510
Mrs. Soprano? Doctor Taschlin's
on the phone for you.

273
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,150
Can you sit here
for a minute, Ton'?

274
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,510
Yeah, I'm winded.

275
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,310
He says he's
downhearted.

276
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,320
I tried to explain
to him

277
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,990
there's an upside
to everything.

278
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,660
Yeah, man.

279
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,830
I know it's
a difficult struggle,

280
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
but let's lead with some good news
for a change.

281
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,030
Yeah.
"Armor Gettin" CD

282
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,400
is now charting
number five, arrow up.

283
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,470
Look, frankly the shooting
couldn't have come at a better time.

284
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,070
Yeah,
but it really hurts.

285
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,940
Sure it does, baby boy.
Sure it does, but check it.

286
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,210
Seven caps!
Tupac ain't get near that.

287
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,910
And 50,
he only got two more.

288
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,710
Yeah, but it really hurts.

289
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,080
It's helping considerably
with the street cred,

290
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,060
which, as you know, has always
been something of a problem

291
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,420
because you had
a job all those years.

292
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,030
I'm gonna
lose my thumb?

293
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,670
Special hand surgeon
coming in.

294
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,240
Come on, man.
You gonna be all right, Lux.

295
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,200
"Don't put on that face.
It don't make me weep.

296
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,470
Keep your eyes to yourself,
you sexy freak. "

297
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,340
Nah, I like it better.

298
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,410
"Keep your eyes to yourself, bitch.
I'm on a murder streak. "

299
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,710
Word, word.

300
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,010
Yeah, kinda warn her ass,
you know what I mean?

301
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,810
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You writing a song, huh?

302
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,790
I always wondered
how it was done.

303
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,020
Like this here.

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,850
Are you a rap star
my son would know?

305
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,050
Da Lux gonna
produce my album.

306
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,130
Then he gets shot.

307
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Make him gangsta
number one.

308
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,020
It's like he losing
focus on my shit.

309
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,830
My son says he's
more popular than ever 'cause of it.

310
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,470
What I know is
I ain't gonna have...

311
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,400
no major release
this year.

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,370
Man.

313
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,880
Dear...

314
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,030
Paulie,
I won $40 at Keno.

315
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,430
Ow!

316
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,270
ls there something
you wanna tell me about?

317
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,240
What?

318
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,240
I just saw
Aunt Dottie, and guess what?

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,140
Turns out
she's not my aunt.

320
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,820
Turns out
she's my mother.

321
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,110
No, that's not true.

322
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,080
Don't bullshit me.
You been bullshitting me my entire life.

323
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,310
- Paulie.
- It's true, isn't it?

324
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,720
Isn't it?

325
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,860
Son of a bitch!

326
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,900
Oh how I dreaded
this day.

327
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,660
I gave you
everything!

328
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,340
I gave you
a son's love,

329
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,400
all under
false pretenses.

330
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,400
- No.
- You're a fraud,

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,870
and a phony.

332
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,410
And she's even worse.

333
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,870
She's a whore.

334
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,570
My mother's
a fuckin' whore!

335
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,710
Don't say that.
She was a young girl.

336
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
She wanted
to be a nun,

337
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,550
but she got
in trouble.

338
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,380
And you helped her out,
cooked up this little scheme.

339
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,020
Forget who gets
victimized!

340
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,820
I loved you.
I always loved you.

341
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,490
Paulie!

342
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,940
There he is.
I've been thinking about your problem.

343
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,010
Maybe it would help you
if you got shot.

344
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,940
Fuck you talking 'bout?
"Got shot"?

345
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,550
Make you more popular too,
you know raise your profile with Ex Lax.

346
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,280
Something easy.
The fleshy part of the thigh.

347
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,250
- I'm a marksman.
- You's a crazy motherfucker.

348
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,090
Good morning. Welcome to "Today"
on a Thursday morning.

349
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,700
- I'm Matt Lauer.
- And I'm Katie Couric.

350
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,390
Poll numbers vary--

351
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,630
... somewhat disappointing
for the administration.

352
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,880
Excuse me. Hi.
You're a friend of Anthony's.

353
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,140
I was just about to visit him.
How's he doing?

354
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,840
He's in a lot better shape than those
fuckin' nuns you got up there.

355
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,020
Put away such memories.

356
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,390
Between father and son,
there is a bridge

357
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,690
which neither time
nor death--

358
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,360
Hey, I got
Phil Leotardo downstairs

359
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,690
This show...
used to watch it all the time

360
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,300
- when I was a little kid.
- What about it?

361
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,100
The bridge of which I speak,
Grasshopper.

362
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,870
- You want me to bring him up?
- No.

363
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,610
Help me out of here.

364
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,360
Hold on.

365
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,460
Easy, easy.

366
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,120
Ho! Where the fuck
you going?

367
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,170
Sorry, Ton'.

368
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,240
Hope you got
some sleep last night.

369
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,940
I was snoring
like a son of a bitch.

370
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,080
Oh, I hope you got some sleep.
I was cutting farts like sonic booms.

371
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,450
John Schwinn.

372
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,250
Oh, bicycle heir.

373
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,930
Unfortunately no relation.

374
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,620
I was just a foot soldier
at Bell Labs.

375
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,090
Oh, you guys
invented stereo.

376
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,670
- Eh...
- Tony Soprano.

377
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,200
What're you in for?

378
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,240
- Sinus infection.
- Oh.

379
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,600
They were going to enlarge the opening
in my lower right maxillary sinus,

380
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,540
and then they saw
some stuff they didn't like,

381
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,510
so they're running tests.

382
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,240
Another guinea pig.

383
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,820
Thank you
for giving my kid that CD.

384
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,490
Tony Soprano?

385
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,280
- Original G.
- Yeah, whatever.

386
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,460
Why don't you come by
my joint later on tonight?

387
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,260
Gonna have the fight
on satellite.

388
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,610
Not even
a courtesy call,

389
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,010
and you try to poach
my company?

390
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,680
No disrespect, Tony.
You've been in a coma.

391
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,110
That give you carte blanche?
Huh?

392
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,450
It's that fucking John.
He's sitting in the can.

393
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,390
The feds are trying
to take everything he's got.

394
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,120
- He's in a panic state.
- I'm sensitive to that.

395
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,230
But whatever happens
to Barone Sanitation,

396
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,920
I gotta be kept on.
I need that W-2.

397
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,770
And as you can see,
I'm facing a long convalescence here.

398
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,030
And Barone is my secondary insurance
carrier. I need it.

399
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,800
John's gonna take care of you.
You know that, Tony.

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,980
But what you're asking?
25% of the sale price,

401
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,310
years' salary
till retirement,

402
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,350
plus skim?
Come on.

403
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,780
Look, I don't
wanna argue.

404
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,290
I'm not well, so I'll give John
a break on the skim.

405
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,230
Getting two Gs
a week now.

406
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,060
How many stops
we base that on?

407
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,930
Ho! How many stops?

408
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,010
- 11.
- The fuck you talking about?!

409
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,640
- It's at least 25.
- 25.

410
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,940
What? Yeah.

411
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,880
All right,
take the skim on 20.

412
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,520
1,500 a week, but I stay on
the payroll as is.

413
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,950
All I can do is deliver
the message, Anthony.

414
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,560
You got your head
up your ass today.

415
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,320
- What's going on?
- My Aunt Dottie's been sick.

416
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,390
Call I got?

417
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,000
She just died.

418
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,110
Oh.

419
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,740
Sorry.

420
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,050
You were close?

421
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,080
Your mom's sister
or your dad's?

422
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,490
Mom's.

423
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,130
She must be
broken up, huh?

424
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,820
Here we are.

425
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,930
Guess your brother
and sister coming in?

426
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,330
Yeah.

427
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,900
Your aunt,
she's the nun.

428
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,600
- Yeah.
- Always wondered.

429
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,780
They got hair
under there?

430
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,540
Yeah, short.

431
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,180
Well maybe you don't
wanna talk about it.

432
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,550
Yeah.

433
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,230
Those wedding rings
they wear...

434
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,760
are they really
married to Jesus?

435
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,660
So I understand.

436
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,980
T, this is the guy,
the paramedic.

437
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,950
"Wallet biopsy"?
Nice.

438
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,920
Very nice.

439
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,850
These people are saying I took money
from your wallet? Fuck that.

440
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What'd you say?

441
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,420
I was looking
for proof of insurance.

442
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,070
- I was only doing my job.
- They heard a lot of that at Nuremberg.

443
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,830
You owe me two K.
It was gone from my wallet.

444
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,230
I don't have
that kind of money.

445
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,340
One week, Rudy Diaz,

446
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,940
or you'll need
a paramedic.

447
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,040
Oh, nice of you
to come by.

448
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,740
We'll see you
next week, huh?

449
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,750
All this activity, Tony,
are you getting any rest?

450
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,320
Absolutely. The guys
are just leaving.

451
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,390
Carmela.

452
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,800
So, you two came together.
You talking now?

453
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,030
Mom apologized to me.

454
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,140
And he got a job
at Blockbuster.

455
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,770
Good. Well I'm glad
to see you made up.

456
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,540
- Yeah, get 'em, man.
- Know what I'm saying?

457
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,740
Fucker keeps
dropping his hands.

458
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,920
Your boy's
getting tired.

459
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,050
Fool's costing me
50 Gs.

460
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,420
Who you place
your action with?

461
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,280
- Pinnacle.
- Online?

462
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,020
What price they give
you on Alvarez?

463
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,320
350.

464
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,050
- Damn!
- Oh man.

465
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,960
Hold the motherfucker
steady!

466
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,470
My friend here'll
give you 375.

467
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,700
Right, Paulie?

468
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,070
He don't even
wanna fight, man.

469
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,710
Wonder what kind
of health insurance he's got.

470
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,400
It's a life of abuse.

471
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,380
Yes, well he
is a boxer.

472
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,380
It's the same
for everybody.

473
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,520
Look at you, T.
You do your uncle a kindness,

474
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,710
you get shot
for your efforts.

475
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,660
You think you got family,
but in the end,

476
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,560
they fuck you too.

477
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,460
He's grieving.
His aunt just died.

478
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,130
I tell ya, we each
and every one of us,

479
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,140
we're alone in the ring,
fighting for our lives,

480
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,380
- just like that poor prick.
- Well, that's one way to look at it.

481
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,770
- You got a better one?
- Don't get me started.

482
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,810
- It's complicated.
- You think I'm stupid?!

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,820
It's actually an illusion
those two boxers are separate entities.

484
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,510
- What the fuck?
- Illusion?

485
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,250
Their separate entities is simply
the way we choose to perceive them.

486
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,480
- I didn't chose nothing.
- It's physics.

487
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,030
SchrÃ♪dinger's equation.

488
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,930
The boxers, you, me-- we're all part
of the same quantum field.

489
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,370
You ever substitute teach
at Carver Middle School?

490
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,060
He's a rocket scientist,
for Christ's sake. Bell Labs.

491
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,570
Shit. Lift it up, nigga!

492
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,970
You were saying?

493
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,170
Well, think of the two boxers
as ocean waves

494
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,480
or currents of air,
two tornadoes, say.

495
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,820
They appear to be two things, right?
Two separate things.

496
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,720
But they're not.
Tornadoes are just wind,

497
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,360
the wind stirred up
in different directions.

498
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,330
The fact is, nothing is separate--
everything's connected.

499
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,230
Everything is everything.

500
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,130
- I'm down with that.
- Get the fuck out of here.

501
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,400
The universe is just
one big soup of molecules...

502
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,630
... bumping up against
one another.

503
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,780
The shapes we see exist only in our
own consciousness.

504
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,140
Keshawn, don't make me
come over there.

505
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,910
You're so fucking smart,
fix that TV.

506
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay, okay.

507
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Besides the financial ramifications,

508
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,670
he says there's the issue of his W-2
and health insurance.

509
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,390
That selfish prick.

510
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm sitting in here
facing a shitstorm

511
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,370
and all he can think
about is himself?!

512
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,450
As far as
the sale's concerned,

513
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,840
that ship has sailed.
It's going through,

514
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,110
and as a friend,
I would appreciate Tony's help.

515
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,910
Because he's a friend,
here's what I'm willing to do.

516
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,120
Cinelli will retain him as waste
management consultant for two years.

517
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,200
During that time, he can keep his
fucking W-2 and his health insurance.

518
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,230
Plus 5%
of the sale price.

519
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,430
And we lease him
a new car.

520
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,900
Are you fuckin'
kidding me?

521
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,040
I told them I need
that W-2 in perpetuity,

522
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,310
and 5% of the fucking
sale price?!

523
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,920
He thinks 'cause I'm
in this weakened condition,

524
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,310
he can take advantage.
Well, he can go fuck himself.

525
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,680
I'm just telling you
what Phil told me, Ton'.

526
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,450
You tell Jason
before he sells,

527
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,520
he better understand
his obligation!

528
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,280
What's up, Paulie?

529
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,680
Since even with Tony's advice,
you seem determined

530
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,450
to sell your father's company,
there's something you should know.

531
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,680
Whatever happens,
we gotta be taken care of.

532
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,990
Yeah, of course.
I'm going to honor whatever provisions

533
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,630
- are in the contract.
- Fuck the contract.

534
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,960
Tony's given years
of his life to that company,

535
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,400
and he expects
to be duly compensated.

536
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,730
Johnny Sack sure as shit
ain't gonna perform.

537
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,130
- Who?
- Mr. Cinelli's waste management

538
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,900
consultant. And since Johnny Sack
ain't gonna step up,

539
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,640
guess what?
It's coming out of your ass.

540
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,710
You know, I'm starting to feel
a little intimidated.

541
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,610
As well you should,
my friend.

542
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,010
A man who teaches skiing
for a living

543
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,420
ought to look after
his physical condition,

544
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,220
wouldn't you say?
His knees.

545
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,220
Kid, you wouldn't be in this
situation

546
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,520
if you'd listened to Tony
in the first place.

547
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,670
He's looking out for you.
He doesn't wanna see you get hurt.

548
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,000
I got a lot on my
mind these days.

549
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,000
I don't need
this shit.

550
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,110
Jason, we shook hands.
A deal's a deal.

551
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,910
There's lifetime employees
who expect compensation.

552
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,950
It's only equitable. Now if you're
willing to take care of that,

553
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,680
maybe we could
still work things out.

554
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,650
Tony Soprano, right?

555
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,620
Fuck that and fuck him.
He's your problem.

556
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,460
- Look, the numbers just don't work.
- Jason!

557
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,660
I'm going
to the buffet table.

558
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,800
Be right there, Mom.

559
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,030
If I give Tony what he wants,
I lose money on the sale.

560
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,540
- I can't do that to my mom.
- Kid, you work it out any way you want,

561
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,070
- but nobody's backing out of the deal.
- Mr. Cinelli, I'm sorry,

562
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,210
but the bottom line is I'm not selling
the company to you.

563
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,080
There are other buyers out there.
Tony was quite clear about that.

564
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,250
I'll tell you the fuckin' bottom line,
laddy buck.

565
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,420
The Barone routes
are now Cinelli routes.

566
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,020
That's that.

567
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,910
T.

568
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,640
Horrible thing.
They brought this little girl in,

569
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,810
she's got third-degree burns
on 80% of her body.

570
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,140
You wouldn't believe
the week I've had.

571
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,490
What?

572
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,660
There's a little girl
burned in there.

573
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,490
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, T.

574
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,560
No. Now what the fuck
is with you?

575
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,500
And I want some answers, 'cause you're
starting to drive me fuckin' nuts.

576
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,630
This remains between us?

577
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,100
'Course.

578
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,140
My aunt who died--

579
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,180
she wasn't my aunt.

580
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
She was my mother.

581
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,950
What?
Your aunt, the nun...

582
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,450
was your mother?

583
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,680
Some cocksucker G. I.
knocked her up during the war.

584
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,420
Russ.

585
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,360
- So what was your mother?
- My ma's my aunt.

586
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,190
She adopted me
to hide the family shame.

587
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,430
Believe this shit?

588
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,070
All I did for her.

589
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,540
Not only is my ma
not my ma,

590
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,440
who the fuck even knows
who this Russ bastard is?

591
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,310
Worst thing,
I'm not who I am.

592
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,250
It's like my whole
life is a joke,

593
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,290
a big fuckin'
joke on me.

594
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,160
Can I come with you every day?

595
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,190
You gotta go back to school.

596
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,060
This is just for the vacation.

597
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,840
Stay here.

598
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,830
- What's going on?
- This ain't your route no more.

599
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,440
It's ours. Cinelli.

600
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,040
What do you mean?
I have this route for five years.

601
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,610
Stupid fuck.

602
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,340
Fuck this.

603
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,180
Papi!

604
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,590
Papi!

605
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,960
Papi!

606
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,200
Papi! Papi!

607
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,340
Papi!

608
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,770
Papi!

609
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,740
Get back in your pajamas,

610
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,580
go to bed, eat nothing but gallons
of ice cream, tons of pizza...

611
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,520
Who's there?

612
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,990
Oh, hi Paulie.

613
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,360
You didn't go to your mother's funeral.
It's a sin.

614
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,190
Some mother. Even a rat don't
abandon its own children.

615
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,200
No, you should
feel sorry for her.

616
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,700
She's gonna have
to face St. Peter

617
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,040
with this stain
on her.

618
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,470
- I hope she rots in hell!
- Don't say that!

619
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,610
And you.
I was your meal ticket,

620
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,980
the goose
with the golden eggs!

621
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,810
Look at this place.
Who set you up here?

622
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,990
Not that fuckin'
brother of mine or Rose.

623
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,620
They never provided
you with shit!

624
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,390
Well, your real children
can start now.

625
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,630
I went without,
so you could have.

626
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,670
The mink coat, the massage chair
from Sharper's Image,

627
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,240
the flat-screen TV.

628
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,540
$2, 000 bucks
for a woman I don't even know!

629
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,800
Paulie!

630
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,890
Paulie, please.

631
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,080
You're on your own.
I never wanna see you again.

632
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,060
I told you. It's a different
corporate culture.

633
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,870
I tried to redefine
the deal.

634
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,050
You shouldn't have made the deal without
talking to me in the first place!

635
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,110
Well God damn it,
how was I supposed to know?

636
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,340
I made it perfectly clear:
Give up part of your profits.

637
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,580
Thanks to you,
a man is beaten half to death.

638
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,220
While his little boy
was watching.

639
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,720
And it's
all over the media!

640
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,420
It's not fair.
The business belongs to my family.

641
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,720
"Fair"?

642
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,990
You fuckin' believe
this shit?

643
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,860
You remind me of my kid.

644
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,660
Talk to the Katrina victims
about fair.

645
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,240
Talk to Paulie here.
He'll tell you about fair!

646
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,670
- Absolutely.
- You're worse than my son!

647
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,970
- Get him the fuck outta here!
- Hey!

648
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,780
How was I supposed to know?
My family kept me in the dark.

649
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,180
What kind of pathetic fuckin' excuse
is that?! Don't you communicate?

650
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,190
You make me sick,
you fucking baby.

651
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,000
Shoot me one time,
one time only, you heard?

652
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,540
Fleshy part of the thigh,
like you said.

653
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,710
There's only 7, 000 here.
I said eight.

654
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Hey, hey, hey, I get my little brother
to do it for less, believe that.

655
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,940
Trust me, you gotta go outside
the family for something like this.

656
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,240
You don't want
people knowing.

657
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,820
That way you can blame it
on Dr. Droop or whoever.

658
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,990
7,000's all I got.

659
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,020
Okay.

660
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,460
I don't wanna know
when it's coming. You decide.

661
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,870
Get this...

662
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,800
It says here that if the history
of the planet

663
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,840
was represented
by the Empire State Building,

664
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,340
the time that human beings
have been on earth

665
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:47,340
would only be a postage stamp
at the very top.

666
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,850
You realize how insignificant
that makes us?

667
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
I don't feel that way.

668
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

669
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,850
There he is.

670
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,120
- Hi, Chris.
- Hesh, how are you?

671
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,290
Great to see you
looking so robust.

672
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,190
- Hey.
- How you doing?

673
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,960
- Beth wanted to come.
- Yeah, sure.

674
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,930
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

675
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,630
So how's Eli?

676
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,970
I hear that with the physical therapy,
they got him using a walker.

677
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,230
He's doing better.
Thank you.

678
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,410
Hey, Tony.

679
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,980
Okay to visit?

680
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah, yeah, sure.

681
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,780
My nephew Christopher,
Pastor Bob.

682
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,080
Hesh Rabkin,
his daughter Beth.

683
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,450
- Hi.
- How you feeling?

684
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,490
Physically,
a little better than I was.

685
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,100
So maybe you're right.
That prayer business works.

686
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,360
I brought you something.

687
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,540
- "Born Again. "
- Charles Colson.

688
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,260
The Watergate guy.

689
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,770
Friend of mine
did time with him.

690
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,470
A ruthless, powerful man
who thought he was above the law.

691
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,170
He committed crimes
and then went to prison.

692
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,180
And then he found Jesus,
and everything changed.

693
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,580
Became a different man.

694
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,590
Yeah, so?

695
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,930
Salvation
isn't just about

696
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,390
being saved from hell
after you die.

697
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,000
It's also about being saved from
yourself while you're still alive.

698
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
I hope when you get
out of the hospital

699
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,030
that you'll join us at the Church
of the Open Door of the Redeemer.

700
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,950
Well it must be nice

701
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,120
to have something
to hold onto.

702
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,080
Maybe.

703
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,960
- Hmm.
- What?

704
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,070
Dinosaurs.
My kids can't get enough.

705
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,740
Yeah, yeah, me too.

706
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,270
Every since I saw King Kong
kick their ass in the original.

707
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,440
My son loves
dinosaurs too.

708
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,340
- That's interesting.
- What?

709
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,480
Some people would
have you believe

710
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,770
dinosaurs existed
millions of years ago.

711
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,470
It's just not true.

712
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,650
God created the earth
6, 000 years ago.

713
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,620
And I tell my kids,
you have to remember,

714
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,350
dinosaurs and human beings
lived on the earth at the same time.

715
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,430
What, like
"The Flintstones"?

716
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,430
It's in the Bible.

717
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,130
Yeah, but what about all that
carbon-dating stuff?

718
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,630
A lot of scientists
would disagree with you.

719
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,140
Well, I think you'll find
all those people have an agenda, Tony--

720
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,370
evolution, which is
Satan's plan to deny God.

721
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,520
Evolution and salvation
are mutually exclusive.

722
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,180
Guy next door's a scientist.
Think he'd disagree with you big time.

723
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,950
Then that man's
not saved.

724
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,020
Read about Mr. Colson.
We'll talk later.

725
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,630
What's he saying? There were dinosaurs
back with Adam and Eve?

726
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,030
- I guess.
- No way.

727
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,000
T. rex in the garden
of Eden?

728
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,800
Adam and Eve
would be running all the time,

729
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,810
scared shitless.
But the Bible says it was paradise.

730
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,710
You can disagree
with Evangelicals,

731
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,040
but they're great friends
of the Jews

732
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,740
because Israel
is the Holy Land.

733
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,850
You wait.

734
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,090
Hey, how ya doing?

735
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,790
- Hi.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

736
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,930
Your color's better.

737
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,380
So Mr. Wizard, you were talking
about tornados.

738
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,420
You know what
the Indians say about the wind?

739
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,520
- No.
- They say that sometimes

740
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,160
we go around feeling pity
for ourselves,

741
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,420
but behind our back,
a great wind is carrying us.

742
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,030
We don't see we're part
of a much bigger reality.

743
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,860
- Then we die.
- Why are you so interested in all this?

744
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,330
I was in this coma
and, uh...

745
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,240
look, I don't
remember nothing,

746
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,670
but before I woke up,

747
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,210
I felt like I was being pulled
towards something.

748
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,420
And I don't
wanna go back.

749
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,720
And my wife told me
I woke up at one point and said...

750
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,660
"Who am I?

751
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,360
Where am I going?"

752
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,600
Kinda makes you wonder,

753
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,900
about heaven and hell.

754
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,130
That presupposes a duality
of good and evil.

755
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,140
You know it gets us
back to the idea

756
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,370
of separate,
opposing entities.

757
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,020
You know where I go
with that.

758
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,410
But this Bible guy
I know says you're going to hell.

759
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,250
Maybe he's right.

760
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,150
Got my test results back.

761
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,590
Laryngeal cancer.

762
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,260
Jesus, I'm sorry.

763
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,230
You know I was thinking,
maybe you could do me a favor

764
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,700
and, uh, you know
what's the term,

765
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,800
"whack" me?

766
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,910
Sorry, bad joke.

767
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,050
- Walking alone again.
- What, I'm gonna wait for Vito?

768
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,820
Hour and a half
to take a dump, that guy.

769
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,620
Could build a jetty
with what comes out.

770
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,170
Little Paulie tells me
you didn't go to your aunt's funeral.

771
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,470
And I'll tell you
something else--

772
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,610
I'm done with Nucci.

773
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,610
Four Gs a month
for that nursing home? Fuck that.

774
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,120
What are you gonna do,
throw her out on the street?

775
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,850
Way I see it,

776
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,580
serves her right.

777
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,850
What the fuck, Paulie?

778
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,890
That woman loved you.
She fed you.

779
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,190
How many times she bail you out
of the can when you were a kid?

780
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,660
Huh? Am I right?

781
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,500
I'll tell ya
what really fries me--

782
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,360
It's not Nucci.
It's Dottie.

783
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,130
I know to your way of thinking,
you didn't have a great mother--

784
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,280
- Ho!
- All I'm saying,

785
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,210
Livia, with all her faults,
never abandoned you.

786
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,900
For Christ's sake, Paulie.
You know what your problem is?

787
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,670
You go around
in pity for yourself.

788
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,820
You think
you got it bad.

789
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,820
You're not stuck
in some hospital room

790
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,550
with fucking tubes
coming out of you.

791
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,690
You can eat food
like a normal person.

792
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,950
T, I never meant
to trivialize your situation.

793
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,390
Well, you gotta get beyond this petty
bullshit, Paulie.

794
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,730
You're part of
something bigger.

795
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,420
When you gonna
learn that?

796
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,310
- My ass!
- Marvin?!

797
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,910
Ow! They shot me
in my ass!

798
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,380
They shot me in my ass!

799
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,550
Marvin!

800
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,420
Pearl's oyster bar--
the lobster roll.

801
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,290
Listen, Ton', that package,
from Vito and Paulie?

802
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,800
I have to believe
that there was more there.

803
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,630
Sure. So?

804
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,640
Vito especially
is somebody you should watch.

805
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,040
Mr. Soprano?
Good morning, Mrs. Soprano.

806
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,810
Ah, the bird of prey.

807
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,650
Okay, it looks like your last drainage
tube is coming out today.

808
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,290
Dr. Plepler says you're stable
and the pain is manageable

809
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,650
so that's good news.
You're husband's coming home.

810
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,350
- Are you sure he's ready?
- What does she give a shit?

811
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,220
She's trying to save a buck.

812
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,030
Hold on a minute.
Guy next door-- Mr. Schwinn.

813
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,730
Had surgery
this morning, cancer.

814
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,000
You know anything
about it?

815
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,270
I heard they
removed his larynx.

816
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,150
...wrote attorney
Jim Sokoloff--

817
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,380
On the city of 6,000--

818
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,390
"Gitanos. "

819
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,760
That's a Mexican word
for gypsies.

820
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,160
Tony? How are you?

821
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,890
Hey! All right.

822
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,970
I made you
some stuffed zucchini.

823
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,300
- He can't eat that.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

824
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,870
It was thoughtful
anyways.

825
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,810
Listen, my condolences
regarding Dick.

826
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,240
- You get my flowers?
- Oh yeah.

827
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,470
They were beautiful.

828
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,580
- Have a seat.
- Oh thank you.

829
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,950
Uh, Jas told me
about the conversation you had.

830
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,560
I can only imagine
how upset you must be.

831
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,190
Well it is a very
unfortunate situation.

832
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,190
Jason just doesn't understand
how the business works.

833
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,920
- That's for sure.
- No, it's not his fault.

834
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,800
It's my fault. Dick and I purposely
kept him in the dark.

835
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,200
Blame me, not him.

836
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,770
You're not involved
in this, Helen.

837
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,460
I was too wrapped up

838
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,130
in my own grief.
I didn't realize...

839
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,280
He's my boy, Tony.
He's my baby.

840
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,880
It'd kill me
if anything happened to him.

841
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,350
What are you
talkin' about?

842
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,450
Tony, please. You have a son.
I'm begging you.

843
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,620
Helen, believe me,
nothin's gonna happen to him.

844
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,420
I'm his mother, Tony.
I love him.

845
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,220
If anyone has to pay
for this, let it be me.

846
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,800
How many times I gotta tell you?
It's gonna be fine.

847
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,490
But, Tony,
do I have your word?

848
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,570
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
you got my word.

849
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,030
Especially good week
this week.

850
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,270
Good.

851
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,370
I know
how good you feel.

852
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:21,670
I was only in the hospital overnight.
I couldn't wait to get out.

853
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,470
Hold on.

854
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,010
You wanna go in,
say goodbye?

855
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,550
No.

856
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,870
I wanted to make sure
you had this before you checked out.

857
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,030
Whoa, whoa.
Not here.

858
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,510
It's all right.

859
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,980
Let's go.

860
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,310
- Ton'?
- Let's go.

861
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,270
Hey. H-hey!

862
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,850
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'll follow you home.

863
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,890
- Janice.
- What?

864
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,390
Supposed to be dead.

865
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,490
Now I'm alive.

866
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,960
I'm the luckiest guy
in the whole world.

867
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,000
Listen, after this...

868
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,870
from now on,
every day is a gift.

869
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,010
Yeah.

870
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,440
I'm gonna go get the car.

871
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,450
Tony? Phil Leotardo
is here to see you.

872
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,920
- Hmm.
- 10 minutes.

873
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,890
You're supposed
to be resting.

874
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,120
Hey, blondie.

875
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,900
It's all you, you know.

876
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,440
The reason I'm back here.

877
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,970
No, it's not just me
by any means.

878
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,000
Thank you
for saying that.

879
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,090
- Anthony.
- Hey.

880
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,120
Johnny doesn't want
another unfortunate incident.

881
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,820
He's willing to let you keep
your paycheck and your W-2 for 10 years.

882
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,060
To replace the skim,

883
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,070
he'll jack up your share
of the sale price to 12%.

884
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,440
No more skim.

885
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,150
Truth be told,

886
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,150
there's enough garbage
for everybody.

887
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,320
- Does that mean we got a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

888
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,860
Be well.

889
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,170
Aw, fuck!

890
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,180
Guess what, fuckin'
mama's boy?!

891
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,010
You're kicking up
four grand to me every month.

892
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,710
I don't care if you're in Deer Valley
or Death Valley!

893
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,750
Four grand,
every goddamn month!

894
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,820
And if you ever mention
a word of this to Tony,

895
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,720
I'll stick this
up your ass

896
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,060
and pull the trigger
till the bullets come out your eyes.
