1
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:44,904
Nobody ever went broke underestimating
the taste of the American public.

2
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:08,358
The ancient Egyptians
postulated seven souls.

3
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,190
The top soul and the first to leave
at the moment of death

4
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:16,391
is Ren:
the Secret Name.

5
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:19,401
This corresponds
to my Director.

6
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:22,370
He directs
the film of your life

7
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:25,101
from conception
to death.

8
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,249
"The Secret Name"
is the title of your film.

9
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,910
When you die,
that's where Ren came in.

10
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,293
Second soul
and second one

11
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:45,590
off the sinking ship
is Sekem:

12
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:49,962
Energy, Power, Light.
The Director gives the orders,

13
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,036
Sekem presses
the right buttons.

14
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:07,918
Number three is Khu:
the Guardian Angel.

15
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,080
He, she or it
is third man out.

16
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,693
Number four is Ba:
the Heart--

17
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,829
often treacherous.

18
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:27,031
Number five is Ka:
the Double.

19
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,232
The Ka, which usually
reaches adolescence

20
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,275
at the time
of bodily death,

21
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:36,312
is the only reliable guide
through the Land of the Dead.

22
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,284
Who's gonna live here?

23
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:44,013
A family. I'll have it
finished by October.

24
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,093
- I'm worried, Ade.
- Everybody's worried.

25
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:55,700
No. I am worried
all the time.

26
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:09,106
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

27
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:13,980
your whole past conditioning from this
and other lives.

28
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:22,117
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.

29
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,097
I'm halfway to China.
There's nothing here.

30
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,202
40, 000 I had--

31
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,896
my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

32
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,540
Did you wrap it right?

33
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,641
It gets moldy--
it could've disintegrated.

34
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,312
- Wrap what?
- The money.

35
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,246
He knows I need that money
for my fucking retrial!

36
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,849
- Who?
- You know who.

37
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,282
No, I don't know who.
That's why I asked you.

38
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,423
- Malanga.
- Will you stop with that?

39
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,025
Pussy Malanga's dead
six years now.

40
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,161
I should dig him up
already!

41
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:03,692
Moles. They chewing
through your sprinklers too?

42
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:30,105
- Slog du in det ordentligt?
Det blir mÃ♪gligt--kan vittra sÃ♪nder.

43
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,602
- Slog in vad?
- Pengarna.

44
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:13,471
We'll look later.
You're gonna be late for your doctor's.

45
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,203
Come on.

46
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,918
Hello?

47
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:29,788
Let me ask you something:

48
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,555
ls your time more valuable
than mine?

49
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:33,357
Where's the baby?

50
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:36,228
Sorry, Ton'. The car seat,
the other stuff--

51
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,233
packin' it in there
takes forever.

52
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,235
You probably
remember that.

53
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,100
No, I don't.
I didn't do that crap.

54
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:44,071
How are you feeling,
Uncle Jun', huh?

55
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,745
He's late enough, Janice.
Come on.

56
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,242
A hello to your niece,
maybe?

57
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,608
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

58
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:51,613
Help him get ready,
will you?

59
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:54,081
- Yeah.
- Come on, Jun'.

60
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,683
So? How's he doing?

61
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,885
He's Knucklehead Smith,
that's how he's doing.

62
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,360
He's paranoid. He doesn't remember
whether he ate or not.

63
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:08,432
The man is not
competent, Tony.

64
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:11,194
- Not again, come on!
- He has the money for assisted living.

65
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,099
He's got legal bills
up the ass.

66
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,206
He can sell this museum
and move to Green Grove.

67
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:18,104
Fuck assisted living, okay?
Remember what they did to Ma?

68
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,940
- She was thriving there, Tony.
- He stays where he is, Janice.

69
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,946
He's our uncle.
It's the least we can do.

70
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,016
So the split,
your friend in Jersey

71
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,348
says it should be the same
as the old business we do over there.

72
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:31,148
That's public works,
this isn't.

73
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:34,053
- I'll hold the line.
- Don't turn it into World War lll.

74
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,592
So day to day,
how are you getting along with Tony?

75
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:41,164
You asked me
to bury the hatchet, John.

76
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,631
I'm doing it
out of respect to you.

77
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:46,066
Am I still grieving
over my brother Bill?

78
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,035
It'll never go away.

79
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,175
I appreciate it, Phil.

80
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,270
- With me in here--
- I hear you, John.

81
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,950
Your bride--
she's a rock for you, kid.

82
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:07,924
Her brother's fitting me
for contacts.

83
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:09,754
When the trial starts,
I don't wanna be

84
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,090
reading documents
in the courtroom with glasses.

85
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,925
It looks weak.

86
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,692
Yes?

87
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,865
- Hey, Ton'.
- Hey.

88
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,170
My sports book
down in Roseville,

89
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,436
Bacala's still making
things unpleasant.

90
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,705
- God damn it.
- Listen, Tony,

91
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,643
I got you something.

92
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,945
For you, Carm, the kids--
David Yurman watches.

93
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:38,216
18-karat gold,
diamond center.

94
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,654
Why do I get the feelin'
there's a jeweler somewhere

95
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,692
filin' an insurance
claim today?

96
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:46,160
Actually,
that ain't what it is.

97
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:48,163
- My Aunt Edie died.
- No?

98
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:51,268
That one that moved to California
back in the '60s?

99
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,598
She was a great lady,
the only person in my life

100
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:55,205
who ever made me
feel special.

101
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,137
What are you gonna do?

102
00:07:57,332 --> 00:08:00,745
Anyway, the silver cloud
is she did pretty well.

103
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,812
She was married
to Victor Borge's agent.

104
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:07,213
She left me an inheritance, Ton'.
Just over two mil.

105
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,684
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,883
Well, congratulations.

107
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,119
Make sure you invest it.

108
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,197
Well, you know, that's kind of
what I wanted to talk to you about.

109
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:23,132
Deanne and me
and the kids,

110
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,099
you know how much
we love Florida, right?

111
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,705
What, do you wanna put some money
on the street down there?

112
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,366
I was thinking about buying
a place in Fort Myers.

113
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,771
- Retiring there, actually.
- Retiring?

114
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,278
What, are you
a hockey player?

115
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:40,748
I'm gonna be 50 in three years, Ton'.
My dad died at 52.

116
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,752
You took an oath, Gene.
There's no retirin' from this.

117
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:47,517
Well, I thought about that,
and there was Joe Bananas.

118
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,559
Come on, huh?

119
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:54,125
What about your sports book,
your other responsibilities?

120
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:55,732
What am I supposed
to do about those?

121
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:58,802
Benny? We know
Bobby wants it.

122
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,837
It's just-- we go back
a long way, Ton'.

123
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,469
Yeah, we do.

124
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:11,480
Fuckin' CYO Basketball,
do you believe that?

125
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:13,413
It'd mean a lot
to me and Deanne.

126
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,020
Well, let me
think about it.

127
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,134
Ooh, look at this one
with the pool.

128
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:31,235
Yeah, we could
go swimming.

129
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,599
Guess who's blocking
the driveway again.

130
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,330
Did you talk
to Tony?

131
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,906
It looks good.
He gave me a hug.

132
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,339
- Did he like the watches?
- Do I know my psychology?

133
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,604
The realtor called.
She's e-mailing some pictures.

134
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:44,943
- The one on River Road?
- The split level-- the four-bedroom.

135
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,517
They lost the buyer?

136
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,019
Hey, there he is.
Where are you goin'?

137
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,851
- Kevin's.
- Who else is gonna be there?

138
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,027
- Gene.
- I don't know.

139
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:59,197
What's with this hostility all the time?
You want a smack in the mouth?

140
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,058
I told you I'm not
getting high anymore!

141
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,791
- I believe you.
- Stop fucking touching me.

142
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:04,663
Watch your mouth
in front of your sister!

143
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,668
I have a right to know
who your friends are!

144
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:09,306
Hey!

145
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,169
Hey!

146
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:29,193
Spicy shrimp hand roll,
that's Nori's favorite,

147
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:32,091
special yellowtail,
toro scallion and oysters.

148
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:34,096
You tell me
when you wanna stop.

149
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,098
Well, keep it comin'.

150
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,203
I don't know about you,
but ever since we found this place,

151
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,533
I catch myself
fantasizing about this.

152
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:44,368
Me too.
Sometimes during sex.

153
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,237
So I had a nightmare the other night.
Did I wake you up?

154
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:52,076
- No.
- Ade was in the house,

155
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:54,275
my spec house.

156
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,182
Was she gonna buy it?

157
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,288
We were just talking.

158
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,254
Speaking of which,
did you call that guy,

159
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,621
the inspector
at the building department?

160
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,024
- I will. I promise.
- He's coming on Friday, Tony.

161
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,755
That could be
my last chance to get

162
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,525
a reversal
on the stop-work order.

163
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:11,066
All right, I'll call.

164
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,568
I wonder where she is.

165
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,104
- Ade.
- I told you, she probably met some guy.

166
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,037
And not call anyone
for over a year?

167
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,645
What's this,
this sauce on the shrimp?

168
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,281
Shiromi, tekka maki,
salmon with tomato.

169
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,544
So I was over
by Ginny's--

170
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,550
that situation is
not going so well.

171
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,586
Johnny cooped up
and awaiting trial,

172
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,689
plus now they're fighting
an asset seizure.

173
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,588
They could lose everything--
the house, the condo at the shore.

174
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,991
You know Jimmy Petrille,
the rat that gave up John?

175
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:43,464
He's like an uncle to him,
his father's compare.

176
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:46,536
Why do you think I toss at night?
Ain't just the apnea.

177
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:49,367
I noticed you haven't been taking
your antidepressants.

178
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,737
And yet, the bonefish
are back in season.

179
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,470
We should count our blessings,
the kind of year I just had.

180
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:56,705
You're right.
We're very lucky.

181
00:11:56,905 --> 00:12:00,978
$40 for a piece of fish
they just flew in first class.

182
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,746
I think we're
more than lucky.

183
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:08,421
Great food in there.
It's pretty good.

184
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,186
You wanna keep
this baggie or shall I?

185
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:11,886
- Nah, you keep it for lunch.
- Okay.

186
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,462
We're here.

187
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,156
Thanks for dinner, Hesh.

188
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:17,267
Grease is coming through
the bag as usual.

189
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,631
Chinese food--
it's part of the tradition.

190
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:23,607
What the--

191
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:25,607
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,472
What the fuck
is this?

193
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,577
Come on, come on!
Hey, where are you goin'?

194
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:33,115
Get out of the car!

195
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:34,650
Get out of here,
get out of here!

196
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,618
- Take a hike, Jimmy.
- Open up, Eli!

197
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,154
- Get out!
- Open the fucking door!

198
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,224
- Get out of here!
- What do you want me to do?

199
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,158
- I can't do anything!
- Fucking Jew!

200
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,456
- Let's go, old man!
- Open the fucking door!

201
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,827
Holy shit, they're trying
to burn us out!

202
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,968
- Open the fucking door!
- Get out, Hesh!

203
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:56,334
- Leave me alone!
- Jerry warned you, Eli!

204
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:03,509
Jerry fucking told you
to stay out of Brooklyn!

205
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,048
What are you guys doin'?
You're gonna kill this guy.

206
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,184
Fuck you, Grandpa!

207
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,620
I tell you, one of the best things
about dropping the weight,

208
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,799
a whole new wardrobe.
I keep this up,

209
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,695
I'm gonna need
Clothing Anonymous.

210
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,496
You should have called your sponsor
before you bought that jacket.

211
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:29,334
Look at this guy.

212
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,839
"Members Only"?
How long have you been wearing that?

213
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,910
Cugino mio!

214
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:36,938
You look sharp.
How do you feel?

215
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,514
Two miles I walk
every mornin'.

216
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,412
You goin' to little
Tommy's communion?

217
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:42,781
I gotta talk to Aunt Lenore.
Say hello to Marie for me.

218
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,683
Hold on, let me
get that number,

219
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,380
- the custom cufflinks.
- Oh yeah.

220
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,151
What'd that prick want?

221
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,624
Really something, isn't he,
with that jerk-off face?

222
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,560
The eyebrows--
I fucking can't stand him.

223
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,895
I gotta tell you though,
he surprised me.

224
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,296
He's acting boss,

225
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:00,973
takes care
of John's business,

226
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:03,335
plus the wife
while John's in jail.

227
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,601
No complaints.

228
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,438
He's real old school.

229
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,307
Gotta take
my hat off.

230
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,074
Cocksucker
wanted me killed?

231
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:13,718
What's past is past.
Leave it alone.

232
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,546
Things are
going good now.

233
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,280
You and Phil settle
that office park shit?

234
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,789
We said
we'd revisit it.

235
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,826
Agent Harris,
where've you been?

236
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:27,226
I got some new federale
in my rear view for six months.

237
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:30,232
- Actually, I've been in Pakistan.
- Get the fuck out.

238
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,268
Seriously.
I was transferred to terrorism.

239
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,599
This is my partner, Ron Goddard.
Tony Soprano.

240
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,605
The terrorist
squad, huh?

241
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:39,244
- What, did you lose a little weight?
- Uh...

242
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,106
You look good.
Atkins, right?

243
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:44,044
I caught a parasite over there.
Doctors don't know what it is.

244
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:46,445
- What do they eat, tabbouleh?
- Actually, that's why I'm here.

245
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:49,712
I've been dying for a Satriale's
veal parm hero.

246
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:56,758
Fuck him. I hope that parasite
eats his asshole out.

247
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,488
I kind of feel bad
for the guy.

248
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,928
Shit, when did
this happen?

249
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:05,695
Hold on.
Ton' just come in.

250
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:07,736
It's Hesh.

251
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,373
Yeah.

252
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,644
Here, honey.
It's ice.

253
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,052
Tony.

254
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:24,188
Thank you.

255
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:26,916
Hey.

256
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,430
Beth, how're you doin'?

257
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,428
I've had
better weeks.

258
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,430
Could you get me
some coffee, sweetie?

259
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:39,593
- Anyone else?
- Hot water with lemon would be great.

260
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,906
My son-in-law and me,
we're having dinner Sunday,

261
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:50,138
Chinese restaurant near Mill Basin,
we get jumped by three guys in a Lexus.

262
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,977
- Chinks did this?
- Are you trying to be fucking funny?

263
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:55,313
- You want a smack in the mouth?
- What? I was serious.

264
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,080
They're with your cousin
Phil Leotardo.

265
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,552
I told you he was a prick!

266
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:00,281
- We were just with him.
- Let him talk.

267
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,358
I got some money
on the street over there.

268
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,155
Apparently, it got back
to Phil's guy

269
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,093
- Gerry Torciano.
- The Hairdo?

270
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,563
He claims that he felt
that Eli here was

271
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:12,601
some independent shy
trying to poach his customers.

272
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:15,365
- ls that a fucking catheter?
- Massive internal bleeding,

273
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:17,804
half his fucking skin
is sheared off his hips.

274
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,739
My daughter's
besides herself.

275
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,073
You send somebody to Brooklyn, and you
talk to Phil

276
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,046
- about this mook, this--
- Gerry Torciano.

277
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,880
Sorry I yelled
at you, kid.

278
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:48,365
I'm installing gable joists
in the rotunda.

279
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,543
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to agree
with the original assessment.

280
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,679
Oh, for the love
of Mike!

281
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,644
This is pine, sir--
utility grade.

282
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,683
I know what it is.
I've been building houses for years.

283
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,422
Then you know that the code calls
for Doug fir grade,

284
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:07,115
stamped for all floor joists,
ceiling joists, lintels and rafters.

285
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:09,852
Get Pudgie Walsh on the horn.
He'll straighten this out.

286
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,690
Pudgie Walsh
retired, sir.

287
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:15,867
- I'm affirming the stop-work order.
- Oh, come on!

288
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:17,866
- ls there nothing else we can do?
- For God's sake!

289
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,630
You can schedule a further appeal.
But if I were you,

290
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:23,774
I'd think about starting over
with the proper lumber.

291
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,941
God, 15 times
I asked you!

292
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:32,947
Do you know what this does
to my cost basis,

293
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,620
- to start over with this?
- It's bureaucratic bullshit!

294
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,654
- ln my day, they'd turn a blind eye.
- I hired you to do a job!

295
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:40,655
Hired?
I'm not for hire.

296
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,657
You presented this
like we were partners.

297
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,727
- You don't listen to anybody, do you?
- Oh!

298
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,229
To hell with this.
No good deed goes unpunished.

299
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:54,367
Artie. Ho.

300
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,632
Menus.

301
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:04,138
- ls that Phil?
- My wife.

302
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:07,842
What's it take to get that guy
to return a phone call?

303
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,646
I want this Hesh thing
settled.

304
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:12,187
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

305
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,417
Jesus Christ, Artie,
I can recite that menu in my sleep.

306
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,266
Where did he get this bread,
the bread museum?

307
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:23,195
The antipaste?

308
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:26,235
Fuckin' Phil.
Now I gotta go see the optometrist

309
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,770
to get a message to John
about this.

310
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:30,305
Go through
Ginny's brother?

311
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:32,443
He's a stunad
of the first magnitude.

312
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,443
I need a back channel
to John, obviously.

313
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:40,210
What the fuck is it?

314
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,217
I can't catch
a fucking break!

315
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,219
This is Tony Soprano

316
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,653
talking about
the Angelo Giacolone murder.

317
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,656
The sound quality
is not good,

318
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,953
but I can back it up
in court.

319
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:52,961
He said--

320
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,517
You all right, Ton'?

321
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,349
Yeah.
That formaldehyde smell...

322
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:20,685
I knew this guy once,
Vietnam vet.

323
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,054
He drank formaldehyde
over there just to get high.

324
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,956
It's the alcohol.

325
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:28,561
Does he have to be here,
your fucking AA sponsor?

326
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,463
It ain't just that he helps me
with the disease, T.

327
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,536
This guy is great
at forging documents.

328
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:36,037
- He was a good kid, Raymond.
- The best.

329
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,575
At least he went fast.
Not like Dick Barone, poor fuck.

330
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:42,008
- Dick Barone died?
- Lou Gehrig's disease.

331
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:44,080
Did you ever think
what a coincidence it is

332
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:47,843
that Lou Gehrig died
of Lou Gehrig's disease?

333
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,385
You gonna make that same stupid joke
every time that comes up?

334
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,387
Sorry.

335
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,252
Everything's
so fucking morbid.

336
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,825
There's a man
lying dead over there.

337
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:58,792
I'm gonna go smoke.

338
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:11,301
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

339
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,308
I don't know
what I was thinking.

340
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,241
For you.
Your taste.

341
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:16,915
The inheritance.

342
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:19,914
I didn't want
to say nothing,

343
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:22,644
with your aunt and all,
but this is thoughtful.

344
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,414
- So that thing we spoke about...
- Still mulling it.

345
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:27,717
Yeah, whatever.
Sure.

346
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,588
All right.
All right.

347
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:33,822
Look at this guy.
Not a day over 76.

348
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,091
- Fucking ballbreaker.
- How are you, Rusty?

349
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:40,304
ls Phil Leotardo here?
'Cause I won't stay

350
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:42,667
- in the same room with that man.
- I haven't seen him.

351
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:45,002
So you hear about that guy
in Westchester?

352
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,803
Fucking captain,

353
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:49,242
doing his own radio broadcast
the last three years.

354
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:52,144
- W. R.A. T.
- Jesus Christ, another one now?

355
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:56,082
No wonder the papers are calling this
"The Year of the Rat. "

356
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:59,553
Standup guys like that,
they're a dying breed.

357
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,749
Amen to that.

358
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,758
What can you do?

359
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,761
Anyway, let me go
pay my respects.

360
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,797
All right, Rusty.

361
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,781
- You okay?
- I gotta get out of here.

362
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,746
He's thinking about it.
What do you want me to tell you?

363
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,114
How many years have we dreamt
about this, to get out of this shit?

364
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,153
Every time someone
we know gets arrested--

365
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:32,619
I know. Will you stop?

366
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,793
I'm worried, Gene.
We've already made the offer.

367
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,053
I'm doing
everything I can.

368
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,290
Why are you fighting?

369
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:43,593
We're not fighting, sweetie.
We're talking.

370
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,168
- How come you're not in bed, hmm?
- I don't know.

371
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,136
All I'm saying is,
he has to see

372
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,173
this is a huge
opportunity for us.

373
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,174
Give the man
time to process.

374
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:58,115
Oh my God,
this eel is delicious.

375
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:00,546
Okay, Spanish mackerel now.

376
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,311
Can I get
another sake, hon'?

377
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:09,324
Listen, I got some stuff
I gotta take care of.

378
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:11,929
You okay
to drive yourself home?

379
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,565
I don't have
my car, Tony.

380
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,996
Oh, yeah.
So take this one.

381
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,261
- Hey, Mrs. S.
- What is this?

382
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,269
Oh my God.

383
00:22:21,462 --> 00:22:23,271
ls this the new Porsche?

384
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:28,845
Cayenne Turbo.
I got the 4. 5-liter V-8.

385
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,015
Wasn't sure about the color,
so I took a shot.

386
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,480
Tony, I love it.
It's gorgeous!

387
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:36,586
I still wish you'd talked to that guy
at the building department,

388
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:38,950
but oh my God!
What a car!

389
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:57,632
Ho, Joe College,
where's your mother?

390
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:01,176
She went to the outlet stores
with Aunt Ro.

391
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:03,404
ls that the jacket
we got you for Christmas?

392
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:06,448
I'm lending it to Matt.

393
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:11,455
Hey, how was the interview
for the internship?

394
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,089
Got moved
to next week.

395
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,986
Would you mind keeping me
in the loop, though, since it was

396
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,753
- my lawyer that set it up, huh?
- Okay.

397
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,465
- Matt don't have his own clothes?
- He's borrowing it for a party.

398
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,161
Oh, good.
You'll never see it again.

399
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:29,568
You have such a low
opinion of people.

400
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,475
Let me tell you
something, A. J.

401
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,477
I don't care
how close you are,

402
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,706
in the end, your friends
are gonna let you down.

403
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,318
Family. They're the only ones
you can depend on.

404
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:52,129
He was vital, my uncle,
alive.

405
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,129
For all his faults,
he was sharp in his day.

406
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,534
But now...

407
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,506
We stopped
at a light yesterday,

408
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,974
and I see this nanny,

409
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:10,375
black girl,
pushing a baby carriage.

410
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,380
Coming the other way,

411
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:14,575
there's another one

412
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,845
with this old lady
in a wheelchair

413
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:20,787
- staring off into space.
- The circle of life.

414
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:24,826
The circle jerk of life.
Where's the dignity?

415
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,898
lf you're lucky, in the end you can
let go of your pride,

416
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:30,966
let your loved ones
care for you.

417
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,137
I'd rather they hold
a pillow over my face.

418
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,568
I find it interesting
you would say that.

419
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,734
You tried to smother
your mother with a pillow.

420
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:44,472
- What?
- ln the hospital, after her stroke.

421
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,811
The fuck I did!

422
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,578
I grabbed a pillow,
but it was...

423
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:53,053
just to keep my hands
occupied.

424
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,056
Have you considered

425
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,524
getting your uncle
some live-in help?

426
00:24:57,718 --> 00:25:00,858
We got a girl comes in days,
she's from Trinidad.

427
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,228
Does he have the means
for assisted living?

428
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:06,666
Did you just say to let your loved ones
take care of you?

429
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,465
- lf it's feasible.
- Well, he's my uncle.

430
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,335
I don't think that's what
we're talking about.

431
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:12,703
What are we
talking about?

432
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,210
The fact that you still,
after all this time,

433
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:18,849
cannot accept you had a mother
who didn't love you.

434
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,246
ln pitying your uncle,

435
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:23,717
the man she conspired with,

436
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:26,414
you're turning the blame
for what she did

437
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:30,526
back on yourself again,
after all this time.

438
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:32,527
What was your mother like?

439
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,029
Did she ever let you down,
hurt your feelings?

440
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:37,429
Of course she did.
She was controlling

441
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:39,763
and manipulative at times.

442
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,430
- She also never tried to kill me.
- I pushed her over the edge.

443
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,906
By placing her in a lovely
retirement community.

444
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:48,477
It's a nursing home!

445
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,012
It's less hurtful to believe
that they were right

446
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:54,049
to try and destroy you
than to accept the fact

447
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:57,221
that she didn't value you.

448
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,924
Hesh is a personal
friend of mine,

449
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,031
and the kid is
his son-in-law.

450
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:10,895
Now I know Phil's got
a lot on his plate, but come on.

451
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,798
I'll talk to John. I was taking
my sister there Saturday anyway.

452
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,201
How is Ginny?
Carmela says she's got her hands full.

453
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:18,900
The kid has the weight
of the world on her.

454
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:24,375
Ray-Bans.
Classic, affordable.

455
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:25,947
I just put those
on special.

456
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,815
You got something
a little more current?

457
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:34,289
Like those.

458
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,522
Armanis.
Flexible acetate frames,

459
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:44,293
rimless lenses.

460
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,207
You know what?
I left my wallet in the car.

461
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,240
I'll catch you next time.

462
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:05,388
Some people
from the lRS came by.

463
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,718
They want to inventory
the entire house.

464
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:12,660
Maybe I should
sell the car,

465
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:14,662
at least get some
liquidity out of it.

466
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:16,493
The Maserati?

467
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,136
Can't say I disagree.

468
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:21,203
That breaks my
fucking heart.

469
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:24,865
Christopher Moltisanti
came over to the house asking about it.

470
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:28,045
He'll pay cash, he said.

471
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:30,874
There's something else,
John,

472
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:33,483
Phil related.

473
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,813
The Hairdo, he's in a beef
with the Jew.

474
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:38,489
What?
God damn it, what?

475
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,488
The Jew's son-in-law.
It got physical.

476
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:43,991
Your friend from Jersey got involved,
but he can't get Phil to focus.

477
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,323
Do I not have enough
on my fucking mind?

478
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,329
The guy from Jersey
asked me to tell you.

479
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:52,026
Well, then call Phil
and have him fucking handle it!

480
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:56,174
Don't yell at my brother, John.
He's trying to do right by us.

481
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:05,207
The pictures
from Allegra's shower.

482
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,870
Noon he said, right?

483
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:31,872
Passive-aggressive
bullshit.

484
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:34,909
I recognize that in people
every time now.

485
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:36,911
There he is.

486
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:39,914
Ho, finally. I was starting to grow
mushrooms out my ass.

487
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:41,847
There's an image.

488
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:50,153
So Gerry filled me in
on the way over.

489
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,955
This whole thing was
a complete misunderstanding.

490
00:28:53,153 --> 00:28:55,292
Yeah, this Eli kid, I had any idea
he was with you,

491
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:57,798
- I would have never...
- He didn't tell you about Hesh?

492
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:01,370
I asked who he was. He high-handed me.
I thought he was a civilian.

493
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,166
Still, to get dragged
by a car?

494
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,639
For the record, though,
the car thing was a hit-and-run.

495
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,641
So what do we do here?

496
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:11,781
- What did we say?
- 25 sounds right.

497
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:14,918
He's bleeding internally.
Pain, suffering--

498
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:17,611
So you tell me. 50?

499
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:19,620
Yeah, fair enough.

500
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:21,724
Could we segue now
into something more pressing?

501
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,724
The floor is yours,
Senator.

502
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:27,159
I spoke to John. The split on the office
park is way out of whack.

503
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:29,060
Same thing
as the Esplanade.

504
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:31,599
Apples and bowling balls, Tony.
With fuel costs now--

505
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,272
Like you're not
passing that on to the drivers?

506
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:36,497
65-35.

507
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,145
All right.

508
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:50,218
Why you always cave
for this prick?

509
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,254
I'm not caving.
It's a strategy.

510
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,424
Johnny's in jail.
You keep him happy,

511
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,994
he'll keep a lid
on Phil.

512
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:03,063
Tony B,
Phil's kid brother,

513
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,598
the bad taste
that left with Phil--

514
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,670
there are 200 soldiers
in his family.

515
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:10,671
I'm not scared of them.

516
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:12,673
- Tony left?
- Yeah.

517
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,073
I stopped by Stewart's.
I got a whole lunch set up.

518
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:30,228
Did Tony mention anything to you
about what we talked about?

519
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,226
About you
moving to Florida?

520
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,865
Did he say if he's leaning
one way or the other?

521
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,735
Listen, there's something
I need you to do.

522
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:44,135
I got a call from Fritzie
up in Boston.

523
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:47,539
There's a guy named
Teddy Spirodakis, owes some money.

524
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:51,682
- You want me to collect?
- That ship sailed. Final notice time.

525
00:30:51,872 --> 00:30:53,351
Really?

526
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,280
You got a problem
with that?

527
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:57,284
No.

528
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:59,820
I just gotta run it by Vito.
He's my captain.

529
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:02,425
Believe me,
Vito will be down with it.

530
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:04,527
So this comes from Tony?

531
00:31:04,718 --> 00:31:07,095
It's coming from me.
I'm not a fucking captain?

532
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,323
All right, okay?

533
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,399
- How soon?
- ASAP.

534
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:14,401
Like right away.

535
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,573
I'll call with the details.
Get it done.

536
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:19,505
I'll put in a good word to T.
about the Florida thing.

537
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,161
The rear deck, didn't they say
that would be refinished?

538
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:45,461
That's the old photo.
It's been completely redone.

539
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,832
The wiring in the pool house?
Tell them they can knock

540
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:50,269
two grand off the price
or they can sell to someone else.

541
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:52,466
Listen, you're responding
to their counter.

542
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,372
You should ask
for whatever you want.

543
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,377
Okay, we'll call you
tomorrow.

544
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,379
All right then,
good night.

545
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,711
What do you think?

546
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:03,511
That if we lose this house,
I'm gonna die.

547
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,523
Ton', what do you want
to do for dinner?

548
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,563
I'll be right down!

549
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,395
Well...

550
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:53,067
Hey.

551
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,501
Your new insurance card.

552
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:57,765
Oh, good.

553
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:03,472
Any thoughts
on dinner?

554
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,513
Whatever you like.

555
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,049
I know this is insane,

556
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,312
but I can't stop
thinking about Nori's.

557
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:12,717
I was just there.

558
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:15,484
- Today? With who?
- Nobody.

559
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:18,094
You went there
without me?

560
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:21,288
Yeah, I was hungry.

561
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,490
- What?
- Nothing.

562
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,499
- Come on, what?
- I don't know,

563
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:27,899
I just thought
that was our special place.

564
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:29,664
Well, it is.

565
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,342
Well?

566
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,738
- I went there alone, Carm.
- I know that. You said.

567
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:38,075
It just felt nice
to have something special, for us.

568
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:40,978
No kids around,
without my parents...

569
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,051
We can go
if you want.

570
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:46,280
No, no,
don't be silly.

571
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,322
Are you sure?

572
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:58,032
How's the car?

573
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:22,623
Teddy, right?

574
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:25,592
Yeah.
Hey!

575
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,795
- Carmela.
- Ginny, hi.

576
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:07,164
I tried calling,
but I kept getting the machine.

577
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,305
ls everything all right?
Truth is,

578
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:11,908
sometimes I don't answer the phone.
Goddamn creditors.

579
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:15,135
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I might kidnap you for a spa date.

580
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,075
Well, that's
a nice surprise.

581
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,977
I thought maybe we'd drive up there,
maybe stop at Occitane.

582
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:21,982
ls that new?

583
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:23,984
Oh, the car?
Yes, yes.

584
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:25,781
Porsche Cayenne,
like the pepper.

585
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:28,186
It's beautiful, Carm.

586
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:30,758
Five minutes

587
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:34,159
at no incline. Then I switch to full
uphill for my cardio.

588
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:36,629
I was telling Tony
he should come with me.

589
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:40,293
- Do him good.
- It ain't just aesthetics, either.

590
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:42,734
God forbid he ever has
a heart attack.

591
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,738
Yeah.

592
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:48,309
Vito, you're in
the handicapped spot.

593
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:51,811
- That fucking guy is here again?
- The man's a former judge.

594
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,153
Hey, listen to this.

595
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:00,086
"lf your nose runs
and your feet smell--

596
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,884
you're built
upside down. "

597
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,084
Funny.

598
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:08,758
Hey, by the way,
your Florida thing...

599
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:12,593
Tony asked me
to speak to you...

600
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:15,671
that's a no-go.

601
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:17,739
- What?
- Can't be accommodated.

602
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:19,671
You're part of the team.

603
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:23,541
- But I just did that thing.
- That's not my department.

604
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:29,085
Well, can I talk
to Tony at least?

605
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:31,084
I wouldn't bother him.

606
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,814
He's out on the new boat.

607
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:38,562
Does he think
I'm gonna talk about shit up here,

608
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:41,255
with what I've done,
what I just did?

609
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:58,645
It's not so silly
when you think about it.

610
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:02,748
I'm a top earner now.

611
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:04,751
It's not out of the realm
of possibility

612
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,686
that I could be the boss
of this family one day.

613
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:11,993
I mean, God forbid
Tony ever gets...

614
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:16,394
cancer, coronary,
something like that.

615
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:30,180
- Yeah.
- Hey, big brother.

616
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,146
Listen, I know I was supposed to sit
with Uncle Jun' tonight,

617
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,443
but Tom just called
from location.

618
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:38,418
Apparently,
some smoke effect went awry

619
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,420
and he inhaled
noxious chemicals.

620
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:41,819
Well, go. Go.

621
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:46,690
The thing is,
Uncle Jun' doesn't want me to.

622
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:49,832
He's exceptionally agitated
today and he's been nauseous.

623
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:54,504
Well, did you call Janice?
I mean, her or Bobby should go.

624
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:57,003
- I'm all the way out here on a boat.
- They can't do it.

625
00:37:57,197 --> 00:37:58,801
- What do you mean can't?
- I don't know.

626
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:01,637
She didn't elaborate.
It didn't seem like she wanted to.

627
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:04,713
- Aw, God damn it!
- I'm sorry, Tony.

628
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:06,713
All right, all right,
all right.

629
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,057
Mother--

630
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:36,477
I swear to God, I'm throwing
all this shit right in the garbage!

631
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:39,012
It's my hobby, Janice.
Why do you gotta belittle it?

632
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:41,708
Will you just
get ready please?

633
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:44,888
- You go. I gotta work.
- You can do your collections tomorrow!

634
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:48,525
I'm on a schedule!
It don't work that way.

635
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:50,524
This is why you can't
watch Uncle Jun'?

636
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,821
I told you last week,
we have Nica's preschool meeting.

637
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:55,192
- She's 15 months old.
- No one was more competitive

638
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:57,333
than your wife when
it came to this stuff with A. J.

639
00:38:57,524 --> 00:38:59,264
A lot of good it did.

640
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,563
This child-- constantly wanting
the breast.

641
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:04,571
He doesn't want to be alone.
He says he doesn't feel good.

642
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:08,302
The school, they need to meet both
parents if it's an intact family.

643
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,207
So call the girl,
the nurse.

644
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:13,713
Miss Trinidad? Right. Every time
I call, a different person answers.

645
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:15,886
I'll go, Ton'.
I'm on it.

646
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,885
Fuck it! You wanna get something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

647
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,649
You were the one
who was opposed to assisted living.

648
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:30,500
You and I
are gonna talk.

649
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,661
You didn't have
to wear your fucking hat.

650
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:36,271
Shit.

651
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:39,738
So how about you?
Are you dating?

652
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,434
With my hours
at the body shop?

653
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:44,637
Ladies.
Dessert was on me.

654
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:46,213
Thank you, Artie.

655
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:48,647
It's nice to see you two
patch things up.

656
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:51,685
- So silly.
- I'm not even sure what happened.

657
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,687
Me and Tony didn't speak
for months.

658
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,415
You pick up
right where you left off.

659
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:58,391
Did Charmaine tell you?
We're getting back together.

660
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,496
No, she didn't
mention it.

661
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:03,460
- That's terrific!
- We're both very happy.

662
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:08,101
Jesus, will you
hear me out at least?

663
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:11,434
We buy here. Livingston,
North Caldwell maybe.

664
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,440
- Right near Tony.
- Oh.

665
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:15,510
Better schools,
new friends.

666
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:18,182
We got the money, baby.
$2 million.

667
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:20,714
It's not
the same, Gene.

668
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:22,977
It could be better.

669
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:25,747
The summers down there--
we were ignoring the negatives.

670
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,857
It's fucking brutal
with the bugs.

671
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:33,223
Tony and Silvio,
all they understand is appearances.

672
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:36,490
We'll buy a new car.
It'll raise my profile.

673
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:39,226
You watch,
I'll make captain.

674
00:40:51,537 --> 00:40:54,643
I found this
under our son's bed.

675
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:10,323
Florida's any better?
It's the drug capital of the world.

676
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:12,263
Look, for Tony to--

677
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,335
Tony, Tony!
Why don't you kill him?

678
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,768
- Put a bullet in his fucking head.
- I can't do that.

679
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:20,034
What, you think I don't know
that you've done it before?

680
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,608
- He's the boss, Deanne.
- The boss of what?

681
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:26,215
He's a piece of shit!

682
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,619
ls our life that bad?

683
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:32,653
It's your money.
Your aunt's money.

684
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:35,655
It has nothing
to do with him.

685
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,430
There's this wonderful
Jersey contemporary

686
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,124
I want you to see with me.
It's cathedral ceilings.

687
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:46,895
You'll fall in love.

688
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:50,998
There's nothing
I can say.

689
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:03,417
Colonel Dax, you're
a disappointment to me.

690
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:06,555
You have spoiled
the keenness of your mind

691
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:08,555
by wallowing
in sentimentality.

692
00:42:08,748 --> 00:42:10,921
You really did want
to save those men

693
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:13,221
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

694
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:15,228
You're an idealist

695
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:17,298
and I pity you as I would
the village idiot.

696
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,970
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

697
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:22,070
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

698
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:25,469
I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

699
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:27,804
I apologize for not revealing
my true feelings.

700
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,979
I apologize, sir,
for not telling you--

701
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,114
- Hello.
- Who's that?

702
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:34,045
- It's me.
- You can go to hell

703
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,413
before I apologize to you
now or ever again!

704
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,486
- What are you doing?
- I lost my uppers.

705
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:40,782
- Probably upstairs.
- God fuck it all!

706
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,925
Relax, will ya?
We'll find them.

707
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:47,155
The phone keeps ringing,
and then they hang up.

708
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:49,298
It's probably salespeople.

709
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:52,629
- I know who it is!
- Pussy Malanga, I know.

710
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:55,771
We'll get J. Edgar Hoover
right on it.

711
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:58,840
I'll tell you what, you go upstairs,
you look for your teeth.

712
00:42:58,965 --> 00:43:02,435
I'm gonna fix you
something to eat, okay?

713
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:07,350
I had a banana
in there.

714
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,912
All right,
we'll find that too.

715
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,528
I got it.

716
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:21,528
We buy a vacation place
in Florida, a condo.

717
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:23,200
It's not the same.

718
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:25,198
I make another run
at Tony

719
00:43:25,391 --> 00:43:27,370
- six months, a year from now.
- A year?

720
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,869
- You can go ahead even.
- What?

721
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:32,565
And let me tell you,
a year, two years from now

722
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,335
everything could be
different.

723
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:37,378
Tony could be gone.

724
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:44,815
- I, uh...
- Go ahead.

725
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:46,922
His master's voice.

726
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,734
Yeah?

727
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:04,933
Now?!

728
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,466
- Gene, this is Agent Sanseverino.
- Hello.

729
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:36,071
Where've you been, buddy?
Haven't heard from you lately.

730
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:39,538
Busy, you know.
My kid has some problems.

731
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,541
That's rough.

732
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:43,975
The thing is, Geno,
you gotta keep in touch with me.

733
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,149
You have a chance to help
in more important ways.

734
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:49,547
- What do you mean?
- We lost a major asset this month.

735
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,154
- The point is--
- Was Ray Curto a cooperator?

736
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:55,553
The way things are shaping up,
you're a designated hitter.

737
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:58,285
Look, Ron,

738
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,224
we've talked
about Florida, okay?

739
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,398
Gene, that's not
gonna happen.

740
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:04,692
Here among your friends
is where you're useful.

741
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:07,598
I told you, you tell your bosses,
I'd come back for any trial.

742
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:10,637
Florida's just one of those things
you gotta let go.

743
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:23,116
Okay.

744
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:26,813
So, the Feast of St. Joe's,
Tony gave some rulings on the unions.

745
00:45:27,013 --> 00:45:29,652
Were any made guys
from New York there?

746
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:17,397
10 minutes, Uncle Jun'.

747
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,592
Who's down there?

748
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:21,896
Artie Shaw.
10 minutes.

749
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:23,903
Don't go anywhere.

750
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:25,905
I'm not.
I'm right here.

751
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:38,545
You got any wine?

752
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:40,746
Malanga!

753
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:04,432
Well, here I am.

754
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,165
ls that a Porsche?

755
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:08,344
Had my eye on it for months.
It's a gift from Tony.

756
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:10,707
I thought about a Boxster,
but I don't know.

757
00:49:10,903 --> 00:49:12,643
The 'Vette felt
more like me.

758
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,375
You bought that
yourself?

759
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:18,384
The accountant says I'm better off
owning it outright.

760
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:32,729
Uncle Jun'!

761
00:49:32,925 --> 00:49:35,234
Call 911!

762
00:49:35,427 --> 00:49:37,270
Uncle Jun'!

763
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,884
Uncle Jun'!

764
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,613
911, where is
the emergency?

765
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:29,781
911, where is
the emergency?

766
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:37,051
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

767
00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:41,925
your whole past conditioning from this
and other lives.

768
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:06,679
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.
