1
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,553
What's that?

2
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,222
I got a mysterious
package,

3
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,224
postmarked Las Vegas.

4
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,562
Oh, "Baume & Mercier."

5
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,400
Oh my God.

6
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,736
This is so beautiful.

7
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,738
I had it engraved.

8
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,708
Here.

9
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,446
"You are my life.
Love, T."

10
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:41,981
- They couldn't fit "Tony."
- I believe that.

11
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,785
Thank you.

12
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,855
But I don't know
what it's for.

13
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:49,757
Well, like I said,
I was sorry

14
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,625
I had to go out
to Vegas when I did.

15
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:53,827
Once you explained

16
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:56,964
you had to take care of
Christopher's business interests...

17
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,536
God knows
Kelli'll need the money.

18
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,771
The baby.

19
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:21,956
I'm talking about
delay, right?

20
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,991
Just take care
of that, all right?

21
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:25,259
Bobby?

22
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:27,294
John Stefano.

23
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,396
You touchin' asbestos?

24
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,165
No, I don't work
with that shit.

25
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,334
It's okay.

26
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:36,537
Shame about
Chris Moltisanti.

27
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,641
Were you get
these bozos?

28
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:43,578
Ecuadorians.
Bunch of 'em polacks.

29
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,680
How come they ain't
wearing their space suits?

30
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,415
That's a union rule.

31
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:49,884
If I couldn't run this job
without that fucking contract,

32
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,686
ain't none of us gonna
make any real scratch.

33
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:56,090
You don't got
an envelope?

34
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,929
You must have seen
fights before.

35
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,598
Your friends beating up
the African kid,

36
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:06,868
why do you think that's
been impossible to shake?

37
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,738
They had my back after
all the shit with Blanca.

38
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:12,340
You know, they care
about me.

39
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:14,843
Did you try to stop
the beating?

40
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,645
I'm one individual.
What could I do?

41
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:28,223
I know kids on Lexapro
who say it's great,

42
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,364
Your classes,
how are you enjoying those?

43
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:40,301
English is boring.

44
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,803
And the other one's
kind of interesting,

45
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,940
but it's pretty
depressing.

46
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,209
The israeli-palestinian
conflict?

47
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,379
People blowing each other up
because their God says

48
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:53,949
they're allowed to live in a
certain patch of fuckin' sand.

49
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,752
Yeah, and other people's gods say
they're supposed to live there.

50
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:00,187
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken it.

51
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:03,023
You seem to be taking
it all personally.

52
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,761
These mujahideen assholes,
like in indonesia,

53
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:08,763
and they, like,
want to kill everybody.

54
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,766
Have you considered writing
about your experience

55
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,902
with the Somali boy?

56
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:16,171
A short story, perhaps?

57
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,273
Why would I do that?

58
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,042
It might help
clarify your feelings.

59
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,478
I was watching CNN...

60
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:29,218
And this story about these
kids in some iraqi hospital,

61
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:33,121
how the burn unit doesn't have
the right medicine or something.

62
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,824
And then they show
this story

63
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,093
about some mall
in Minnesota

64
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,328
and these gigantic
fat people

65
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,063
buying stuff

66
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,332
and eating all
this shit.

67
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,936
You know, it's like
my parents.

68
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:50,371
I mean, you should
see our house.

69
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,941
I mean, the stupid
coffeemaker they got,

70
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,409
the media room.

71
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:58,245
Then there's Blanca,

72
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,514
her kid hardly talks.

73
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:04,251
She can't afford to send him
to a decent school.

74
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,354
You think your feelings
about Blanca

75
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:10,758
in any way relate
to this African boy?

76
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,227
She's not black.

77
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,398
I mean,

78
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:18,734
she's pretty tan.

79
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:22,335
(XXX)

80
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:28,309
- Oh!
- There he is.

81
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,644
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

82
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,713
Welcome back, Ton'.

83
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,181
Good to see you again.

84
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:35,683
How was your trip?

85
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,085
Great.
Had a fuckin' blast.

86
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:39,453
Yeah?

87
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,058
Business too.
Christopher's shit.

88
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,661
Some fucking guys
out there owed him money.

89
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,767
Little Carmine took it on the
"cleaver" set. We had it framed.

90
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,304
Talk about a trip...

91
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:00,107
I met this girl,
she was fuckin' beautiful.

92
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,510
Oh yeah?

93
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,445
- Boys.
- Hey.

94
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,549
- We did peyote.
- Come on.

95
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,251
- Really?
- Bobby did mushrooms once.

96
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,720
Stuffed mushrooms,
a whole fuckin' platter.

97
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:14,455
Fuck you, huh?

98
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,327
Anyway, that's...
That's some nutty shit,

99
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:22,463
the desert...

100
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,466
The light.

101
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,502
I did "X" once. The
fucking was incredible.

102
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,140
Oh, yeah yeah, you kiddin'?
Off the fuckin' charts.

103
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,176
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Really?

104
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:38,045
And the sun...

105
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:40,114
came up...

106
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:45,186
Oh yeah?

107
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,254
Well.

108
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,027
We saw Stefano.

109
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,963
He didn't have
an envelope.

110
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:58,699
Any movement on that?

111
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:03,037
Eh, we should
probably see phil.

112
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,706
I got dosed with acid once,
back in '68.

113
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:08,075
I was with your dad
and them at the copa.

114
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:11,178
Fuckin' B.O.A.C. stewardess
put it in my drink.

115
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,014
Jerry Vale started
singing and I look over,

116
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:16,917
your uncle jun's got laser
beams shooting out of his eyes.

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,156
I used to love
that house, but now...

118
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:24,893
It's so big,
especially at night.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,329
You're afraid, you know,
all you got to do is call.

120
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:28,763
Right?

121
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,265
Two minutes,
i'll be over.

122
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:32,300
I know.
Thank you.

123
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,569
You've been so great.
Both of you.

124
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,372
Well, meadow had another
mystery date.

125
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,707
That sounds exciting.

126
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,952
What are you doing?
Sit.

127
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,322
I made your favorite,
steak pizzaiol'.

128
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:56,024
You know they spray
a virus on beef

129
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,560
rather than clean the ratshit
out of the slaughterhouses?

130
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,062
- What is this now?
- Jesus Christ.

131
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:04,532
It's true.
Read the paper.

132
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,868
I do read the paper.
Never heard that.

133
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,506
I'm not talking
about the sports page.

134
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,143
I mean, the F.D.A.?

135
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:15,204
They approved a virus spray
because it kills

136
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,612
a similar bacteria
found on meat.

137
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,614
Must be
a good thing then.

138
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:22,584
Yeah.
For the meatpackers,

139
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,653
the fucking God
of the bottom line.

140
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,321
All right,
that's enough.

141
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,657
We're trying to eat here,

142
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:31,994
and you're upsetting people
that have been through a tragedy.

143
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,597
Fine. Bury your head
in the sand.

144
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:37,933
How about I bury yours
in that fuckin' wall instead?

145
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,134
Tony.

146
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:42,137
For 20 years,
he won't crack a book,

147
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:44,940
all of a sudden he's the
world's foremost authority.

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,950
At least he's getting
an education.

149
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:57,319
An education's to help you
get a better job.

150
00:10:57,385 --> 00:11:00,255
He's actually reading.
This can't be bad.

151
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:02,724
"The blood-dimmed tide
is loosed,

152
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,226
and everywhere,
the ceremony of innocence

153
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,962
is drowned;

154
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:09,798
The best lack
all conviction,

155
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:14,502
while the worst are full
of passionate intensity.

156
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,105
Surely some revelation

157
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,107
is at hand."

158
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,476
"... Somewhere in the
sands of the desert

159
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,545
a shape with lion body

160
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:28,083
and the head of a man, a gaze
blank and pitiless as the sun,

161
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,452
is moving its slow thighs,

162
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:33,855
while all about it reel shadows
of the indignant desert birds.

163
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,258
The darkness drops again;

164
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:40,795
but now I know that
twenty centuries of stony sleep

165
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:43,765
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,

166
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:47,168
and what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,

167
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,971
slouches towards bethlehem
to be born?"

168
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,644
Hey, Tony.

169
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,680
You don't look
so good.

170
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,649
This job.

171
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,617
You want a sandwich?
A cannoli

172
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:03,752
on the house?

173
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:05,687
No, this microbe
of mine...

174
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:08,323
From pakistan.

175
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,492
- Still?
- You got a minute?

176
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,661
We'd like to show you
some pictures.

177
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:14,863
Angelina Jolie,
I hope.

178
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:19,467
These the gentlemen?

179
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,803
That's them.

180
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:27,142
What the fuck?
What?

181
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,644
Don't know.
Financing, maybe.

182
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,613
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

183
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,950
Honestly, i'm not even sure we
still have them in the country.

184
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:37,986
Thanks
for stopping by.

185
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,623
Next time we'll have
party hats.

186
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,669
Your nephew's widow,

187
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,705
she get my flowers?

188
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,274
Well, if you sent 'em,
I'm sure she did.

189
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,043
Well, I won't expect
a thank you anytime soon.

190
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,413
The grieving process, it takes
time the closer you are to somebody.

191
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,282
Yeah, I know.

192
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:12,587
So, brass tacks,

193
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:15,056
what brings you
all the way out to the city?

194
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,792
Good news. The condos
at the navy yard...

195
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:19,594
Paulie's guy at
the joint fitters

196
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,196
says they're
breaking ground.

197
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:23,598
- Well, that is good.
- Good, yeah.

198
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,138
Uh, the other thing,
this asbestos...

199
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,008
I thought about
your offer.

200
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,243
What do you say
to 15%

201
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,878
plus we forget
about the balance

202
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:39,047
of what you owe me
on the vitamin truck?

203
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,149
First off,
it wasn't an offer.

204
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:44,552
It's my position.
25%.

205
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,922
That's it?

206
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,090
What else would you
like me to say?

207
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:51,760
Come on, phil,
what's the problem?

208
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,895
I come here
in good faith,

209
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,897
I make a reasonable
counter.

210
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:59,601
Which I considered...
and rejected.

211
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,303
Do we need to talk
in private?

212
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,071
For what?

213
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:07,475
Okay then, in front
of everybody...

214
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,679
When you were sick

215
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,714
in the hospital,

216
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:15,216
we talked.

217
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:18,653
We shared a...

218
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:23,024
An understanding
about life.

219
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,559
This is business,
Anthony.

220
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,428
Yeah, I know.

221
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,131
But I'm talking to you
here on a human level.

222
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:33,368
There's a limit, Phil.
Come on.

223
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:37,005
A point where business
bleeds into other shit,

224
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:40,942
feelings make things
financially unfeasible.

225
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,511
Charles schwab
over here.

226
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,622
So that's it?

227
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:58,026
No leeway, no compromise,
just stupid fuckin' jokes?

228
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:01,329
You want compromise?
How's this?

229
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,298
20 years in the can,

230
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:04,966
i wanted manicott'.

231
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:07,435
I compromised.

232
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:11,139
I ate grilled cheese
off the radiator instead.

233
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,375
I wanted
to fuck a woman,

234
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,443
but I compromised.

235
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,712
I jacked off
in a tissue.

236
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,581
You see where
I'm going?

237
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,249
Yeah.

238
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:35,730
- Butch, Coco, didn't anybody call you guys?
- About what?

239
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:37,901
Don't tell me
the fuckin' checks are late?

240
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,302
There ain't any checks.

241
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:43,104
- The fuck you talkin' about?
- Silvio... Mr. Soprano's guy...

242
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:45,607
Came by this morning,
said to pull your jobs.

243
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,509
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Fuck that.

244
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,945
- Where's our money?
- I don't got it, there's no jobs.

245
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,080
Motherfucker.

246
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,549
I'm sorry, guys. Somebody
really should have called you.

247
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,752
Hey!

248
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,454
Jesus Christ!

249
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:05,894
guys, that's enough, come on.
It's not his fault.

250
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,830
- Oh, yeah? Maybe it's
your fuckin' fault?

251
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,400
Call the police!

252
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:23,144
Tony Soprano
owes you $320.

253
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,887
Hey.

254
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,526
I was just watching
"Borat" on cable.

255
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:42,097
You can watch that thing 50
times and it's still hilarious.

256
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,567
He brings that lady
his shits.

257
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,137
It wasn't fair
to the people involved.

258
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:52,073
You loved it
when it came out.

259
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,476
What do you want,
Meadow?

260
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,479
- How was your exam?
- I didn't take it.

261
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,651
Leave that!

262
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:05,287
okay?
Thank you.

263
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,929
Why didn't you
take the test?

264
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:16,898
'cause I dropped out,
okay?

265
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,900
What's going on
with you?

266
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,003
I'm your sister,

267
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,005
you have
to talk to me.

268
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:26,541
Is this still
about blanca?

269
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,445
You know, I don't
know anymore.

270
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,418
I know how
you feel, okay?

271
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:40,021
When finn and I split,
I cried every day

272
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:41,790
for, like, a month.

273
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,892
You realize we're
gonna bomb Iran?

274
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,027
You don't know that.

275
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:47,662
You watch.

276
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:51,032
Bush, before he
leaves office...

277
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,902
And you know
I'm right.

278
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:56,871
Okay.

279
00:17:56,938 --> 00:18:00,175
But you need to learn
to shut stuff out.

280
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,344
Are you crazy?

281
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,913
I mean, do you hear
what we're talking about?

282
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,982
You say that,
but I come in here

283
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:09,184
and you're surfing
the web for porn.

284
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,119
It's not porn.

285
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,528
"Al-Jazeera"?

286
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,865
Don't you ever feel like
there's no point to any of this?

287
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:27,636
Why don't you try
setting goals for yourself?

288
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:30,071
Maybe you
should move out?

289
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh right,
in my condition?

290
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,276
I mean, I can't
hold a job.

291
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:37,045
Jesus, A.J., there has to
be something you can do.

292
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:40,081
Look, I'm ill, meadow.
All right, I'm on medication.

293
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:43,318
Millions of people
take Lexapro.

294
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:45,253
I need mom's cooking.

295
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,322
It could mess
with my blood chemistry.

296
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,124
Do mom and dad know
you dropped out?

297
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,526
No, and don't
tell them.

298
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,461
I took time off,
remember?

299
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,665
They broke my balls
but it really wasn't so bad.

300
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,234
Of course not.
I mean, you're their pet.

301
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:02,370
We're italian, A.J.
You're their son.

302
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,839
Do you have any idea
what that means?

303
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,977
You'll always be
more important.

304
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,981
- You're awake.

305
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:20,055
I made Lincoln log
sandwiches.

306
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:22,090
Maybe later.

307
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,763
I am meeting Gab
for lunch,

308
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,700
and then we are
stopping at Nordstrom's.

309
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,972
If you go out, make sure
you set the alarm.

310
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:38,840
Okay?

311
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,591
Jeez!

312
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,273
Somebody!

313
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,308
Help!

314
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,712
Help!

315
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:07,756
Help! My arms!
They're frozen!

316
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:10,158
A.J., what the fuck?

317
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:12,894
Dad! Help...!

318
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:15,330
Help!

319
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,171
No, dad!
Ah!

320
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,742
- my leg, it's stuck!
- on what?

321
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:32,847
What the fuck
did you do?

322
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:35,550
Hel... Help!

323
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,226
All right, I got you.
Stop fighting me.

324
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:49,698
- All right...
- Don't...

325
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:52,167
All right, turn around.
Grab the side.

326
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:54,336
Grab the side
right there.

327
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,071
All right.

328
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,381
All right.

329
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,018
God damn it.

330
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:16,691
Hold that.

331
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:22,864
Help me.

332
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:25,200
All right,
climb!

333
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:41,783
What's wrong
with you?!

334
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,757
All right.
Are you all right?

335
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,728
All right, come here.

336
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:55,497
Come on.

337
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,699
Turn around.

338
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,534
Come on, baby.

339
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:02,070
You're all right, baby.

340
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:05,006
You're all right, baby.
You're all right.

341
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:08,843
You're all right.

342
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:17,285
Well, here we are.

343
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:20,355
I'll get him settled. You can come
tomorrow during visiting hours.

344
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:22,490
I love you, sweetie.

345
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:26,194
- I love you.
- I love you too.

346
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:28,263
He's had a lot
of Valium.

347
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:57,025
But he was better
for a while.

348
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,927
Look, it's not
your fault.

349
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:01,896
You warned us.

350
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,503
Come on, come on.

351
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:12,474
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

352
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,442
It will, mom.

353
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:17,145
But he was always
so happy.

354
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,848
He was our
happy little boy.

355
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:28,523
Come here, baby.

356
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,129
There you go.
White balls.

357
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:46,274
- Skip.
- Hey, Ton'.

358
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:51,913
There he is.

359
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,749
You hungry, T? You want, I'll
send the kid for Baja Fresh.

360
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,652
Anything from Phil?

361
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,454
No, not yet.

362
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:11,833
All right, let's dispense with the
500-lb elephant in the room, eh?

363
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,169
My kid tried
to off himself.

364
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,304
We all fuckin' know.

365
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:24,512
That's it.

366
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,916
Nobody's got
nothing to say?

367
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:30,919
How's he doin', Ton'?

368
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:35,056
They got him
under observation.

369
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,058
Whatever the fuck
that means.

370
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:41,930
Stupid fuck.

371
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:48,303
Where did I lose
this kid?

372
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,938
What did I do wrong?

373
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:51,773
Whoa, come on.

374
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,508
Don't blame
yourself, T.

375
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,177
A lot of pressure
on kids today, ton'.

376
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:58,146
Still, to try
to kill himself?

377
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:00,949
It's happens, skip.

378
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,585
Happen to your kids?

379
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:05,287
Or yours?

380
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:06,922
They're all
different, Ton'.

381
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:08,423
My son Patrick?

382
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,392
I love him to death,

383
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,227
but he can be a moody prick sometimes.

384
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:14,562
Heather, you know,
she was 15,

385
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:17,032
she went through
a rough patch.

386
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:18,333
Jason, same thing.

387
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,902
And he's got
the hyperactivity to boot.

388
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:25,073
My son too.
The older one, James.

389
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,142
- He tried to kill himself?
- No no.

390
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:31,446
I don't know, he...
He gets the blues.

391
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:35,350
The important thing is A.J.'s
getting the help he needs.

392
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,720
Whatever it is, i'm sure
it's a chemical imbalance.

393
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:42,023
Ask me, it's all these
toxins they're exposed to.

394
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,059
It fucks
with their brains.

395
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,961
Between the mercury
in fish alone,

396
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:48,797
it's a wonder there ain't
more kids jumping off bridges.

397
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:13,421
I can't
fuckin' shake it.

398
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:16,057
Shake what?

399
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:19,027
- I'm depressed.
- Excuse me?

400
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:21,129
I'm depressed.

401
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:24,165
I'm telling you,
don't you start now.

402
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:26,434
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

403
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:29,838
I have enough on my plate, I don't need
you adding to it with your bullshit.

404
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,172
Bullshit?

405
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,041
It's an illness.

406
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:34,509
And it's fuckin'
hereditary.

407
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:35,977
Thank you, I know.

408
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:38,713
I am intimately acquainted
with the soprano curse.

409
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,182
Your father, your uncle,
your great-grandfather

410
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:43,585
who drove the donkey cart
off the road in avellino,

411
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:46,021
- all of it.
- What, you think it's a joke?

412
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:49,124
- Am I laughing?
- Then what are you saying?

413
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,630
He didn't get it
from my family,

414
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:57,166
that's all
i'm gonna say.

415
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,435
Your family don't
even talk.

416
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:00,470
Your father's
so bottled up

417
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:02,805
it's a wonder he's even
got a stomach left.

418
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,142
As opposed to yours?

419
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,543
At least my father was upfront
about what was bothering him.

420
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,279
Right, with a bullet through
your mother's beehive hairdo.

421
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Oh, I knew it.

422
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:13,982
I was wondering how long it was gonna
take for you to throw that up at me.

423
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,550
You're amazing,
you know that?

424
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:19,020
In high school, you were
the happy-go-lucky rascal,

425
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,423
the comedian,
the rapscallion.

426
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,325
But all of that was
bullshit, wasn't it?

427
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,993
Oh, poor you.

428
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,195
She got married
under false pretenses.

429
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:29,197
You've been playing
the depression card

430
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,399
until it is worn
to shreds.

431
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,768
And now you've got
our son doing it.

432
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,570
Card? Card?

433
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:36,805
You heard me.

434
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,240
Oh, so it's
all me, huh?

435
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,842
Our Sonny boy? You had
nothing to do with it?

436
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,012
It wears you down, Tony.
That's all I'm saying.

437
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,115
Do you have any idea what it's
like to spend day after day

438
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,618
with somebody who is
constantly complaining?

439
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,455
Fuck you.

440
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:14,242
It could have been
a cry for help.

441
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:17,312
Aren't you listening?
He did cry for help.

442
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:19,915
He's lucky I came
home and heard him.

443
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:22,350
I meant
the botched attempt.

444
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,753
On some level,
he may have known

445
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:27,656
that the rope was too long
to keep him submerged.

446
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:30,225
Or he could just be
a fuckin' idiot.

447
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,460
Historically,
that's been the case.

448
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:39,467
Me and Carm were
getting along so good too.

449
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,106
My father and his
panic attacks,

450
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,242
my fuckin'
demented uncle,

451
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,980
not to mention the other one...
Eckley the fuckin' retard.

452
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:55,617
You think there are other reasons
why your son is so unhappy?

453
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:59,187
He's got the world
by the balls...

454
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:01,489
Every fuckin' advantage...

455
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,993
And he hits one little pothole
and he goes into hysterics.

456
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,332
Yeah, I know.

457
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,903
I'm not taking
the rap,

458
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,271
not completely.

459
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:20,675
She coddled him, his mother.
I said it before.

460
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,347
Every little problem,
she's right there

461
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,349
to pick him up
and wipe off his tears

462
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:29,517
on her apron strings.

463
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:32,220
Children need
to feel safe.

464
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,889
I'm sure that made him
into the man he is today.

465
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,192
Are you ashamed of him?

466
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,798
Yeah, actually I am.

467
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,002
The coward's way out.

468
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:48,803
Isn't that
what they call it?

469
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,941
I think whoever said that
didn't understand depression.

470
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:56,211
But you do, don't you?

471
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,291
Where's dad?

472
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:12,160
Oh, Meadow got rear-ended
on Bloomfield Avenue.

473
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:15,330
- He'll come see you later.
- Is he still mad?

474
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,165
He was never mad, A.J.

475
00:32:17,232 --> 00:32:18,667
He loves you.

476
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,805
How long do
I have to stay here?

477
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,874
Dr. Vogel thinks it
might be a good idea

478
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,810
for the time being
just to take a time-out.

479
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,378
Like I'm in preschool?

480
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,260
Did you see
Dr. Vogel today?

481
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,329
Today we have group.

482
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:58,306
Did you eat today?

483
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:01,076
I had some turkey.
It had no flavor at all.

484
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:03,912
I'll bring some
chicken parm tomorrow.

485
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,948
I don't think
that's allowed

486
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:08,984
on account of all
the bulimic girls.

487
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,992
So it's front-row mezzanine
at "Grey Gardens,"

488
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:18,627
- and the guy says...
- Excuse me?

489
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:22,897
- You're Tony Soprano's kid, right?
- Yeah.

490
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:25,734
Small world, running
into you like this, huh?

491
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,302
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

492
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,938
You got a little cream
on your mouth there, sweetie.

493
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:32,107
Be happy to add to it.

494
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:33,508
- What?
- Excuse me.

495
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:35,543
Lucky guy, her dad.

496
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,713
Must be fun tucking her
in at night, huh?

497
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,483
- Do you have a problem?
- Not yet.

498
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:43,652
Would you like one?

499
00:33:43,718 --> 00:33:45,186
Coco, come on.

500
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:46,955
What?
I'm saying hello.

501
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,990
Come on,
let's go.

502
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,926
Hey, best to
your dad, huh?

503
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,001
What the hell
was that?

504
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:05,473
...but that is not
for you to decide.

505
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,976
Don't say anything.

506
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:12,414
What, are you two talking
about me again?

507
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,087
What's the matter?

508
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:20,689
Nothing.

509
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,892
What?

510
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,898
Do you know a guy
named Coco?

511
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,200
Why?

512
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,069
She was out
on a date last night

513
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:36,204
and he came over
and pulled some crap.

514
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,973
What?

515
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,575
How?

516
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:42,310
We were in the city,
Little Italy.

517
00:34:42,377 --> 00:34:44,179
We were
having dessert, and...

518
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:45,880
He came up
out of nowhere

519
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:48,683
and just started saying
all this weird stuff.

520
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,086
What kind of weird stuff?

521
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:52,854
How he'd like
to tuck me in at night.

522
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:54,689
Stuff like that.

523
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:58,260
- Tuck you in?
- I could smell the sambuca on his breath.

524
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,530
What exactly
did he say?

525
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,300
He came up to us

526
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,969
and he asked me if
I was your daughter

527
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:11,640
and then he said
i had whipped cream

528
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,174
on my mouth.

529
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,377
Yeah?

530
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,079
What else did he say?

531
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,855
It's all right.

532
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:29,791
It's okay.
He's an idiot,

533
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:31,927
but he's harmless.

534
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,663
I'll talk
to somebody.

535
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:41,202
So this boy
you're dating,

536
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,805
this man,
who is he?

537
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:46,508
You promise not to start
with an inquisition?

538
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,877
Will you stop with all
the secrecy, please?

539
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:54,316
- It's Patrick Parisi, okay?
- You're kidding me?

540
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,718
That's exactly why I didn't
want to tell you guys,

541
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,353
and why he didn't tell
uncle Patsy.

542
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:02,290
I thought he...
Where are you going?

543
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:04,726
Meeting... Sil.

544
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,995
We have Vogel later,
don't forget.

545
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:11,399
I thought Pat Parisi
was engaged.

546
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:12,968
They broke it off.

547
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,170
We kind of hooked up
at the "Cleaver" premiere,

548
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:17,472
we started talking.

549
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,407
He's changed a lot.

550
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:21,276
I really like him.

551
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:23,778
So why the big mystery
all this time?

552
00:36:23,845 --> 00:36:26,448
I knew you and daddy
never liked him.

553
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,149
No, it's not that
we didn't like him,

554
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,851
it's just...

555
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:34,489
So all those times
you told me

556
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:36,891
you were staying with your
friend Kimmie in the city,

557
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,227
I suppose you were staying
at his apartment?

558
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:40,729
Sometimes.

559
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:46,368
Look, there's
something else.

560
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,236
What?

561
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:52,073
I've decided not
to go to med school.

562
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,175
What? Why?

563
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:56,511
Oh, it's just too hard.

564
00:36:56,578 --> 00:37:00,148
- Isn't anything that's worthwhile?
- You have no idea.

565
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,118
- Of course not.
- Don't get sarcastic.

566
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:06,121
I really think
it's law for me.

567
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:09,658
I mean, you should hear Patrick
talk about the justice system

568
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:11,493
and what it means.

569
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,528
It's really inspiring.

570
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:30,979
Obviously Sheila resents me.
I'm dating her father.

571
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,584
The sullen looks,
the transference to me

572
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,485
of her issues
with her mom...

573
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:39,354
As your favorite
patient says,

574
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:42,157
"maybe I should put
my shoe up her ass?"

575
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:44,926
Which patient of mine
says that?

576
00:37:44,993 --> 00:37:46,428
Mine, Elliot.

577
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:49,097
Your favorite patient
of mine?

578
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,299
Oh.

579
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,336
He hasn't been
in the paper much lately.

580
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:56,571
You miss that,
don't you?

581
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:59,241
My father was a rabid
"Untouchables" fan.

582
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:01,009
Make of that
what you will.

583
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,349
What, Elliot?

584
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,985
I ran into Nancy Duggan
last week.

585
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:12,954
- Do you know Nancy?
- Vaguely.

586
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:14,856
She's on staff
at Rikers Island,

587
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:17,559
works with a lot of
sociopaths, as you can imagine.

588
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:21,196
Anyway, she told me
something interesting.

589
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:24,332
A lot of studies
about talk therapy

590
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,868
as it relates
to sociopaths

591
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,036
and criminals,

592
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:31,573
one of them is
The Criminal Personality

593
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,643
conducted by Yochelson
at St. Elizabeth's.

594
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,511
Essentially

595
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:38,413
it concludes

596
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,782
that talk therapy,

597
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:44,319
while not only being
useless with sociopaths,

598
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:47,022
actually serves
to validate them.

599
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:52,060
Yochelson says they sharpen
their skills as conmen

600
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:55,096
on their therapists.

601
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:58,333
Crocodile tears,
what have you.

602
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,435
Why are you smirking?

603
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,038
- I'm not.
- Oh really?

604
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:05,707
We showed data.

605
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:08,710
The one-year
reconviction rates

606
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:11,413
were higher for offenders in therapy

607
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:14,916
than for those receiving
no treatment at all.

608
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:26,094
Uh, some peppers
and cheese.

609
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:28,830
Eh, Gorgonzola,
all right? Don't forget.

610
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,401
Whoa whoa!

611
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:34,970
Sit down.

612
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:37,339
- Sit down.
- Easy easy.

613
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,644
You motherfucker.
My fucking daughter?

614
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:45,513
My fucking daughter,
you motherfucker.

615
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,182
My fuckin' daughter!

616
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:49,951
Hey, want some
sambuca with this?

617
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,954
Tony, you're making
a big fuckin' mistake here.

618
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,692
How about I put a bullet
in your fuckin' head, huh?

619
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:07,869
Don't do it!

620
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:15,877
You want some?

621
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,295
It's always what
you think, isn't it?

622
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,563
It's never how I feel.

623
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,668
Oh, poor you.

624
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,703
It's all your mother's
fault, isn't it?

625
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,673
- I didn't say that.
- You're a mama's boy.

626
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,641
You're gonna
call me names now?

627
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,843
No one is calling
anyone any names.

628
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,412
How about
my confirmation?

629
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:52,047
You called me
an animal.

630
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:53,782
I did not!

631
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,051
I was in the garage
and you said,

632
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:59,020
"what kind of animal smokes
marijuana at his confirmation?"

633
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:02,524
He was using illegal drugs
in the home.

634
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:07,095
Did it ever occur to you that i
might have been self-medicating?

635
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,097
Give me a break,
will you?

636
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:13,034
And how about
second grade?

637
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,804
You made me show up to
school in that dorky raincoat.

638
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:18,707
I got beat up
because of it.

639
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:24,512
You would hole
up in that room for hours.

640
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:29,084
Because I was never really secure
expressing my feelings in that house.

641
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,286
I mean, that's why.

642
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:41,296
What kind of poem is that
to teach college students?

643
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:50,438
Would you like
to tell your parents

644
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,207
what your
grandmother said?

645
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:54,242
My mother?

646
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:59,948
Grandma...
Dad's mom.

647
00:42:00,015 --> 00:42:01,883
What'd she say?

648
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,319
That it's all
a big nothing.

649
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:06,187
What is?

650
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:07,989
Life.

651
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,928
That was her,
all right.

652
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:15,430
Okay, fine, she said
those kinds of things...

653
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:18,033
She sat up in bed...

654
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:20,669
When she could
hardly move.

655
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,571
She could hardly
breathe.

656
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:28,410
She said in the end that your
friends and family let you down,

657
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:31,079
and that you die
in your own arms.

658
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:32,781
When was this?

659
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:34,683
When she was
in that nursing home

660
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:36,251
and you used
to make me go see her.

661
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:45,293
We're not too young
to be grandpas.

662
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:52,367
Ton'?

663
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,803
Carmine Lupertazzi.

664
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,105
- I'll see you later, skip.
- All right.

665
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,875
We should have dinner,

666
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:02,978
you know, Carm,
Donna, maybe the kids.

667
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:04,112
Yeah.

668
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,648
I hear wedding bells
are in the air.

669
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,955
You want anything?

670
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:15,757
No, I'm good.

671
00:43:24,165 --> 00:43:26,935
If there's anything I can
do, Tony, for Anthony Jr...

672
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:28,970
Thank you.

673
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:31,873
When Alexandra had
that bout of anorexia,

674
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,242
we had this terrific
psychologist.

675
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:36,778
She tried to kill herself,
your daughter?

676
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:38,346
No.

677
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:40,982
She had serious problems
though, didn't she?

678
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:43,818
Not really.
It's all under control.

679
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,823
So...

680
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,859
The reason Ii'm here

681
00:43:50,926 --> 00:43:52,494
you could
probably guess.

682
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,497
What happened
at Coco's restaurant.

683
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:58,934
This alteration
you had with him...

684
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,036
You're at
the precipice, Tony,

685
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:03,371
of an enormous crossroad.

686
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:06,675
Phil's considering shutting
down the Hackensack mall project

687
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:08,777
with a plumbing strike
as we speak.

688
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:10,879
Fuck it.
Let him.

689
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:13,381
Easy for you. I have
the scaffolding contract.

690
00:44:13,448 --> 00:44:15,350
Oh, is that what
this is about, Carmine?

691
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:16,751
What do I owe you?

692
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:19,921
Come on, huh?
You know me better than that.

693
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:22,591
My daughter, Carmine.
My daughter.

694
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,427
You got a little girl.

695
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:26,962
You almost
killed the guy.

696
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:29,698
I should've killed him.
I'd have had total support,

697
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:33,335
- but I held myself back!
- You were being prudent.

698
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:35,103
Fuck that.

699
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:40,542
I lost it.

700
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,546
Timing couldn't have been
worse, but what the fuck?

701
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,448
So you go to Phil,

702
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:48,984
I go with you,
hats in hand,

703
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,252
bended knees.

704
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:07,168
Why me, huh?

705
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:09,704
Doesn't every parent
make mistakes?

706
00:45:09,771 --> 00:45:12,274
Why not you?

707
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,142
'cause I'm
a good guy...

708
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:15,911
Basically.

709
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:19,481
I love my family.

710
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:24,586
There's a balance.
There's a ying and a yang.

711
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:26,121
Huh?

712
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:35,630
You think you know.
You think you learned something.

713
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:39,034
Like when I got shot.

714
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,603
Know what?

715
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:47,075
All right.

716
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:51,279
When I was in Las Vegas,
I took peyote.

717
00:45:52,614 --> 00:45:55,183
Curiosity,
I don't know.

718
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,052
You were searching
for something.

719
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,791
Well, I saw some things.
Not...

720
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:04,993
Things, per se,
hallucinations,

721
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,062
Roger Corman shit.

722
00:46:07,128 --> 00:46:10,765
- It was kind of disappointing, there wasn't any of that.
- What was there?

723
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:12,701
It's kind of hard
to describe.

724
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:17,172
I mean, you've done it, right?
Acid, shit like that.

725
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,673
No.

726
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:27,282
All I can say is

727
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:30,885
I saw,
for pretty certain,

728
00:46:30,952 --> 00:46:33,088
that this...

729
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:35,590
everything we see
and experience,

730
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:37,292
is not all there is.

731
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,861
What else is there?

732
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,964
Something else.

733
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,402
But that's as far as
I'm gonna go with it.

734
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:50,272
I don't fuckin' know.

735
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:52,574
Alternate universes?

736
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:54,509
You gonna be
a fuckin' comedian now?

737
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:56,311
I'm not.

738
00:46:58,513 --> 00:46:59,681
Maybe.

739
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:04,286
This is gonna
sound stupid...

740
00:47:06,254 --> 00:47:09,491
But I saw at one point
that our mothers are...

741
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,630
They're bus drivers.

742
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,370
They're...
No, they are the bus.

743
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:25,473
See, they're the vehicle
that gets us here.

744
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,177
They drop us off
and go on their way.

745
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,146
They continue
on their journey.

746
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:34,516
And the problem is that we keep
trying to get back on the bus,

747
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,485
instead of just
letting it go.

748
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,025
That's very insightful.

749
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:46,294
Jesus, don't act
so surprised.

750
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:57,239
You know...

751
00:47:57,305 --> 00:48:00,408
You have these thoughts,
and you almost grab it.

752
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:02,844
And then...

753
00:48:02,911 --> 00:48:05,213
Pfft.

754
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:12,887
Butch, how are you?

755
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:15,924
Phil is not accepting
visitors right now.

756
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:18,026
I just talked to him
on the phone, Butchie.

757
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:19,694
I just talked
to him in person.

758
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:21,496
He ain't seeing nobody.

759
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:23,365
What's going on, Butch?

760
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:25,333
I just brokered
this thing.

761
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,435
He came here to make
a peace offering.

762
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:30,038
A semi-trailer of drills...
Makitas.

763
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:32,574
We don't want
your fuckin' drills.

764
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:34,142
Fuck it.

765
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,844
Let's go.

766
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,728
That's right, cocksucker!

767
00:48:53,795 --> 00:48:56,331
- Go back to New Jersey!
- Phil, what are you doin'?

768
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:59,067
Take that piece of shit
and get off my stoop.

769
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:01,169
But we just
talked about this.

770
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:03,138
Well, cooler heads
prevailed.

771
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:06,207
- Uncle Philly!
- Uncle Philly my ass.

772
00:49:06,274 --> 00:49:08,810
Will you just come down
so we can discuss this?

773
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:11,513
There's nothing left
to discuss, Carmine.

774
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:17,319
I don't understand.

775
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:19,387
Why is he like this?

776
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,963
Hey, it's Sleeping Beauty.

777
00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:29,497
I didn't sleep a wink.

778
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:31,533
I know, we've been
waiting for you.

779
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,335
We have the chess set
all ready.

780
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:36,271
- He cheats.
- Hello, honest Abe?

781
00:49:36,338 --> 00:49:39,207
- Whatever.
- We just haven't played for so long.

782
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:41,476
I know, I just got
all this stress at work.

783
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:43,478
It's cool, it happens
to a lot of people.

784
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,547
- Really?
- Absolutely.

785
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:47,882
More than half of adults
report experiencing

786
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:50,485
some kind of insomnia at
least a few nights a week.

787
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:52,787
We just
want you back.

788
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:54,823
- Thanks, guys.
- When you can't sleep...

789
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:09,905
No food in
the unit, sir.
