1
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,985
Stop!

2
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,486
Stop! What are you doing?

3
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,321
What are you doing,
you closing me up!

4
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,285
Mister, where do you
suppose you are going?

5
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,330
Stop! Stop!
I demand you stop!

6
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,709
I demand you come back here
this instant!

7
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,130
This instant, you motherfucker!
You motherfucker!

8
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,632
Motherfucker!

9
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,176
Motherfucker!

10
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,761
Yeah.

11
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,346
Zanone Brothers.

12
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,891
This fuckin'
series, huh?

13
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,852
Your driver, he comes here,

14
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,688
He dumps the garbage
all over the place!

15
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,523
He did, huh?

16
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,816
What "he did"?

17
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,776
How about those Nets, huh?

18
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,569
You come get it now!

19
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,904
Get what, sir?

20
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,698
The goddamn, goddamn garbage.

21
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,950
We thought you wanted it back.

22
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:22,951
What?!

23
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,703
What?!

24
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,121
The rag-head
from the deli.

25
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,874
Hello, where are you?

26
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,252
You called yesterday
to complain?

27
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,796
That's our policy,
it's written on our trucks.

28
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,591
Double your garbage back
if you're not satisfied.

29
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:44,640
I complain because you didn't make
full pickups on 12, 16, 20th.

30
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,309
And then I get
charged double for it!

31
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,020
Right, we had to come out twice.

32
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,066
You charge me double
for pickups you miss?

33
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,402
My dispatcher asked you
if you're not satisfied

34
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,696
Did you want
your garbage back?

35
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,157
Of course I don't
want garbage back!

36
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,159
Then you're satisfied.

37
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,454
You are speaking shit to me.

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,250
We'll try to send
a truck out tomorrow.

39
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,383
What are we talking,
eight to 10?

40
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,345
For god sake Alan, I can
plead him out of three to five.

41
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,892
All right, talk to Mike Gendler,
see what he says.

42
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,852
What's all this?

43
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,981
You looked thirsty
last time I saw you.

44
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,279
Oh, yeah, you know what?
I knew I left this someplace.

45
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,949
New?

46
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,617
You know,
keeping busy.

47
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,286
Carmela, the kids?

48
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:47,953
Good.

49
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,496
You know, school shit.

50
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,290
You bet that game last night?

51
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,249
Yeah.

52
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,918
What do you think
I need this for?

53
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,923
So, what do I
owe you, counselor?

54
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,467
You'll pay me when I actually
have to do something.

55
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,803
Let's hope that fuckin' day
never comes, right?

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,680
It almost did very recently.

57
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,058
Here we go, the Neil Mink
lecture series.

58
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,061
Well, isn't it fair to say
we were staring into the abyss?

59
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,605
A very close call, that brush
with a murder beef.

60
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,608
I told you, I was home alone.

61
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,819
You and Macaulay Culkin.

62
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,364
Except that neither one of you
would have been alone.

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,783
Champagne's nice.

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,161
But you want
to give me a real gift?

65
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,997
Insulate yourself
from these shenanigans.

66
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,248
I told you
once already.

67
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:33,957
I do.

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,000
I am.

69
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,460
What the fuck
you want from me?

70
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,962
Use one of the businesses
we've got you in,

71
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,466
for something besides
showing income on a tax return.

72
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,218
Spend time
at garden state rendering.

73
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,971
Oh, please, you know what
boiling fat smells like?

74
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,390
You have an office
at Barone Sanitation.

75
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,935
Get your ass out of that
strip club and go there.

76
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,855
All right, I hear you.

77
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,191
The feds are
a business, Anthony.

78
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,778
Millions of tax dollars
invested in watching your ass.

79
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,988
Sooner or later
just like you,

80
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,033
They're gonna want a return
on that investment.

81
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,286
Mother of fucking mercy.

82
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,289
What'd you take
a sledgehammer to my balls?

83
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,667
That's just the incision
where I inserted the stent.

84
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,378
You're gonna feel
a little tenderness.

85
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,712
Okay, almost there.

86
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,546
Easy.

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,092
You should use
the bedpan next time.

88
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,510
I'm not a cat.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,928
I don't shit in a box.

90
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,554
You have to watch
your heart.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,847
My heart's fine.

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,892
When I get out of here
we're going to a discotheque,

93
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,643
you and me.

94
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,853
Discotheque.

95
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,689
What's so funny?

96
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,069
Mr. Soprano.

97
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,279
I'm Michael McLuhan from
the U.S. Marshal Service.

98
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,658
Here to reattach
your electronic bracelet.

99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,078
They you give you
the important jobs, huh?

100
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,497
Excuse me.

101
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,582
Your name's really
McLuhan?

102
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,333
Right.

103
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,753
So, that makes you
Marshal McLuhan.

104
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,755
That's right.

105
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,341
What?

106
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,801
What's the fucking joke?

107
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,431
All right, you may feel
some pressure in your chest.

108
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,308
But that'll go away as the blood
flow to heart increases.

109
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,103
Just stay in bed,
plenty of fluids.

110
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,729
Get you home tomorrow.

111
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,482
Lucky fucking me.

112
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,698
Sandwich or something?

113
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,159
Did you hear me with my balls,
who can fucking eat?

114
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,800
...New York's only
classic rock station, Q-104...

115
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,479
What are you
looking at?

116
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,023
Nothing.

117
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,025
Just looking
out the window.

118
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,028
Gettin' my eyebrows done.

119
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,510
Remember...

120
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,845
One mouth, two ears.

121
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,764
Listen to each other.

122
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,103
I'll see you next week.

123
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,479
Okay.

124
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,500
So, what's up?

125
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,214
I don't know,
I'm...

126
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,133
I'm bored or something.

127
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,886
I don't want
to come here no more.

128
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,305
Well...

129
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,476
Not the first time
we've heard you say that.

130
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,983
No offense,
but let's face it,

131
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,860
this is starting to feel
like a waste of time.

132
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,570
I'm sure for the both of us.

133
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,405
I don't feel that way.

134
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,205
Like the other day
I'm watching this movie

135
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:10,001
with Brad Pitt and that blonde,
Gwyneth Paltrow.

136
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,628
"Sliding Doors"?

137
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,129
Fuck no, "Seven".

138
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,591
It's a good movie,
and I never seen it before.

139
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,638
But halfway through it,
I'm thinking, this is bullshit.

140
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,182
A waste of my fucking time.

141
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,685
Why do I give a shit
who the killer is?

142
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,146
What difference Is that information
gonna make in my life?

143
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,898
Very true.

144
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,525
So, I shut it off.

145
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,610
Good for you.

146
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,071
What did you
do instead?

147
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,616
I went out in the yard and burned
ants with a magnifying glass.

148
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,455
A little sense of humor here?

149
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,335
What's the matter?

150
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,462
You still in mourning over
the coming of managed care?

151
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,298
Go on.

152
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,050
What's the point?

153
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,886
You go to Italy,
you lift some weights,

154
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,388
you watch a movie.

155
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,808
It's all a series of
distractions 'til you die.

156
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,935
I hear
Depression talking.

157
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,688
Yeah, well, I'm not
upping my dosage.

158
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,231
Medication,
medication,

159
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,108
medication, what do I
got to show for it?

160
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,486
Who knows where you'd be
without the medication?

161
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,158
Anyway, some people
take pleasure

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,827
in the simple
doing of things.

163
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,496
Yeah, well, the things
I take pleasure in, I can't do.

164
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,251
Currently trying
to change my business profile,

165
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,753
if you know
what I mean.

166
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,380
So, it's all about
your legal problems.

167
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,697
I'm gonna get the car.

168
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,574
Don't disappear,
meet me out front.

169
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,118
Corrado?

170
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,454
I thought that was you.

171
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,373
Catherine... Romano.

172
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,043
Catherine.

173
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,671
Mr. Soprano, you have to stay in the
wheelchair until you leave the building.

174
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,964
Hospital rules.

175
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,299
So, call a cop.

176
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,259
A little procedure,

177
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,637
you'd think that they'd
worry about the sick people.

178
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,597
It's all about
the insurance.

179
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,307
You remember my Chuckie?

180
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,851
Little Chuckie,

181
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,728
you drove the bike
for the butcher's.

182
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,857
I gotta call Karen, ma.

183
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,403
He's a cop now,
like his father.

184
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,363
A detective.

185
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,031
He's a good egg,
your Lou.

186
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,575
He was a real straight-shooter,
he had a lot of class.

187
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,746
Hodgkin's, no?

188
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,665
It's been almost 15 years.

189
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,416
That long?

190
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,419
The week the shuttle exploded.

191
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,589
The pension helps.

192
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,966
The grandchildren.

193
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,718
You look good, Corrado.

194
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,136
You healthy?

195
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,514
A little heart trouble,
nothing much.

196
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,851
You broke your ankle?

197
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,519
Bunions.

198
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,649
You still
in Belleville?

199
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,443
Same house, Watsessing avenue.

200
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,322
I'm right on Ampere Parkway
near our beloved alma mater.

201
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,784
Maybe we could
have coffee.

202
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,410
Catch up.

203
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,829
There's an IHOP
by the dry cleaners.

204
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,875
The doctor says I'm not
supposed to leave the house.

205
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,126
Too much stress.

206
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,506
Sir?

207
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,800
The chair.

208
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,253
What the fuck, I don't
show up for eight years,

209
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,589
all of a sudden you turn
my office into a storeroom?

210
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,760
No, I'm gonna get
this shit cleaned right out.

211
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,719
Connie!

212
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,262
Connie!

213
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,933
This is Mr. Soprano.

214
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,059
Tony.

215
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,268
How ya doing?

216
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,770
Connie Desapio.

217
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,773
What happened to Diane?

218
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,193
A little self-indulgent when
it came to the office supplies.

219
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,279
Connie, Mr. Soprano's
been out the in the field,

220
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,740
but he's gonna be spending
some time with us here at HQ.

221
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,326
So, let's get Ralphie
in here, and Danny too,

222
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,787
and let's move these
boxes out, the books.

223
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,996
What should
I do with them?

224
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,332
I don't know, make room.

225
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,378
I'll put them
by the copy machine.

226
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,758
Nice rack.

227
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,718
Born-again Christian.

228
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:12,845
Oh, yeah?

229
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,057
Listen, while
I have you here,

230
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,600
we may have
a little problem.

231
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,476
Richie Aprile.

232
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,311
Yeah, I know,
I heard.

233
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,188
He tipped a truck
at a deli in Nutley.

234
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,147
That fucking guy.

235
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,649
But that's not it.

236
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,986
One of Zanone's drivers,
the illustrated man?

237
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,613
Richie's got him
running an operation,

238
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,699
selling blow
along the routes.

239
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,827
Now, the Department of Sanitation,
I can handle, Tony.

240
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,706
But if the D.E.A. gets involved
we're gonna lose our 901.

241
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,793
Sonofa-fuckin'-bitch.

242
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,129
I'm sorry, I don't like
to break your balls.

243
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,881
You know that piece of shit's
gonna be my brother-in-law?

244
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,011
Nice, huh?

245
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,096
The Rico act, Elliot.

246
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,058
We sat there and we talked
about the fucking Rico act.

247
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,437
You treat different patients.

248
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,897
Your base of knowledge expands.

249
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,527
Two years ago I thought
Rico was a relative of his.

250
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,124
Cards-on-the-table time.

251
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,792
How's the drinking?

252
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,586
I don't know.

253
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,505
Worse, I guess.

254
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,841
Are you an alcoholic?

255
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,184
I am drinking
in between sessions.

256
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,228
That's very serious.

257
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,898
Just on the days
that I see him.

258
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,609
I can't take it.

259
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,403
Finally, thank you.

260
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,990
Are you taking steps
to seriously end it?

261
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,159
He wanted to end it.

262
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,828
He said last time
he wanted to stop coming.

263
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,121
But I talked
him out of it.

264
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,456
Why?

265
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,834
If I was at Sloan and
he had a pituitary tumor,

266
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,003
would I stop
him from coming?

267
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:18,012
Elliot, it's like that thing
with watching a train wreck.

268
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,475
I'm afraid and repulsed
by what he might tell me.

269
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,646
But somehow I can't stop myself
from wanting to hear it.

270
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,949
Okay.

271
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,329
All set.

272
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,332
It'll ramp up
to eight pounds per cubic inch.

273
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,251
Keep your airway open
when you're sleeping.

274
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,128
I don't snore.

275
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,629
Ah, don't be embarrassed.

276
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,881
Obstructive sleep apnea
is serious.

277
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,009
Every time your airway closes down
and you wake up fighting for breath,

278
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,470
it puts tremendous strain
on your heart.

279
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,765
Dr. Schreck is absolutely right
in prescribing this for you.

280
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,559
Makes me look
like a sick man.

281
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,060
You're not sick.

282
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,981
But testing shows rem-wise,
you have 40 arousals per hour.

283
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,775
More since I met you.

284
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,904
Such a thing to say.

285
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,868
Arousals mean a change
in your stages of sleep.

286
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,495
You are such a flirt.

287
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,582
I'll stop by tomorrow, okay,
see how you did?

288
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,083
Be counting the beats.

289
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,962
Who's that?

290
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,964
Judge Crater,
how should I know?

291
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,465
The one who ordered
the house arrest?

292
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,218
Answer the door,
it's a goddamn expression.

293
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,347
I'm gonna go
wash my hands.

294
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,853
Hello, I'm Catherine,
a friend of Corrado's.

295
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,563
Fuck me.

296
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,362
Oh Catherine,
what a surprise.

297
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,823
I would've called,
you're unlisted.

298
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,201
I brought manicotti.

299
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,995
How's your foot?

300
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,580
It's better, thanks.

301
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,415
Heart?

302
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,083
Better.

303
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,795
Is this a bad time for a visit?

304
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,714
Actually, the nurse
just got here.

305
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,717
We were about to
have my examination.

306
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,554
Oh well,
maybe Friday then.

307
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,682
I volunteer at the bingo
since Louis past.

308
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,145
Well...

309
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,648
enjoy the manicotti.

310
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,858
Thank you,
I will.

311
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,571
You're awful.

312
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,283
Neighbor lady, she went to
school with my older brother.

313
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,412
I'll see ya tomorrow.

314
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,006
What'd you send
that lady away for?

315
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,174
I thought you were bored.

316
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,051
Talking to that
dreadnought would help?

317
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,262
She seems all right.

318
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,555
What the hell would
we have in common?

319
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,601
Bunion, you know
how I feel about feet.

320
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,487
Look at this.

321
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,781
You believe this one
with the cleavage?

322
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,200
Finger food is better
than last year.

323
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,620
It's not the landfill,
the problem's the limit.

324
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,539
Right now we're
at two grand a day,

325
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,291
But with the D.O.S.
breaking our balls,

326
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,334
I gotta fuck
with the ins and outs.

327
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,503
Oh yeah, what's that?

328
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,714
The paperwork,
you know?

329
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,299
List the gross tonnage.

330
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,509
I gotta file it
in triplicate every day.

331
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,468
Right.

332
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,432
How ya doing?

333
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,851
Is that your wife,
Dickie?

334
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,687
Yeah, c'mon,
I'll introduce you.

335
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,981
I'm getting
engaged myself.

336
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,108
Hey some place, huh?

337
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,777
That landscaping
is gorgeous.

338
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,114
Janice, you're
completely transformed.

339
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,741
What can I say?

340
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,160
"You look good, Janice"?

341
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,078
You look
pretty good, Janice.

342
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,622
You are a giant asshole,
you know?

343
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,041
C'mon.

344
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,625
...Nirvana.

345
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,754
You got a minute?

346
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,465
Jesus Christ,
let me get a drink.

347
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,550
Naw, we'll grab
a waiter, c'mon.

348
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,886
I'll see you.

349
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,179
Excuse me, ladies.

350
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,014
Have you met
Helen Barone?

351
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,599
Hi, Jan Soprano.

352
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,767
Nice to meet you.

353
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,726
Nice to meet you.

354
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,230
Got any blow?

355
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,108
What?

356
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,693
Blow, you know, coke.

357
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,696
What, you don't
keep it on you?

358
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,198
I gotta go
to the deli in Nutley?

359
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:47,823
Tony.

360
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,158
You don't sell that shit
along those routes,

361
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,326
you understand me?

362
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,786
I'm working
with Junior on this.

363
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,287
I don't give a shit
if you're working with Walmart,

364
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,497
knock it the fuck off.

365
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,416
I'm trying to earn here,
we're saving for a house.

366
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,627
You got enough in your plate
just picking up garbage.

367
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,337
Not if you and
that fucking association,

368
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,422
and that cocksucker Barone
don't let me expand.

369
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,008
Are you fucking
stoonad or what?

370
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,052
After five years.

371
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,054
The cops are finally
leaving garbage alone.

372
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,306
A drug bust on one of
those routes is different story,

373
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,767
you got the FBI, the D.E.A.,
those fucking pricks

374
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,727
are gonna be breathing
down our necks again.

375
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,813
It's a little coke.

376
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,481
What is the big deal?

377
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,816
You and my uncle,

378
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,110
you want to deal drugs,
that's your business.

379
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,238
You do it on association garbage
routes, it's my fucking business.

380
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,615
It stops today,
you got it?

381
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,203
Don't give me your
fucking Manson lamps,

382
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,663
just fucking stop.

383
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,208
Another thing, don't tip
a truck on a problem customer.

384
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,837
I fucking hate the way
you make me fucking ride you.

385
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,631
Now, get the fuck
out of here.

386
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,031
...Municipality went private,

387
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,534
So, now we're bidding on a landfill
down in West Virginia.

388
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,287
I started reading
the EPA's new guidelines,

389
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,955
on curbside recycling.

390
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,915
I'm telling you,
listen, I'm telling you.

391
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,292
Just listen to me, guys.

392
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,461
I got it right through
the transfer station.

393
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,964
And listen to this, it
scaled out at nearly 3,000 tons.

394
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,966
Three-thousand tons.

395
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,304
...Talking about instituting
a yard waste ban,

396
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,598
in half the states
on the Eastern seaboard.

397
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,821
Oh.

398
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,990
Oh, my god, Tony.

399
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Call an ambulance!

400
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,660
Jesus Christ.

401
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,870
Turn him over,
Carmela.

402
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,121
Tony.

403
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,706
Watch his head,
watch his head.

404
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,920
The pills,
the analysis.

405
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,589
You pay her a fortune,
what is she doing for you?

406
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,965
Will you leave me
the fuck alone?

407
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,800
If it was a man
you'd ring his neck.

408
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,011
I got a fucking rash now,
last week or two.

409
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,970
Leave me alone.

410
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,014
Putting a wing
on her house.

411
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,808
Mr. Soprano.

412
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,019
I have your results.

413
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:22,937
Yeah.

414
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,189
Just preliminary, but as far
as I can tell, it's...

415
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,690
Nothing physical, right?

416
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,319
For Chris sake, I just passed out,
if it's nothing physical,

417
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,737
then what the fuck
is wrong with me?

418
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,657
I would think
you'd be relieved.

419
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,408
I'll be relieved when
somebody puts their finger on

420
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,993
whatever the fuck it is
that's wrong with me.

421
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,913
I wish it was physical, so I could
have it ripped the fuck out.

422
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,124
I'm sorry, it's just
very frustrating,

423
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,543
I know you're only
trying to help.

424
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,339
You know, losing
some weight wouldn't hurt.

425
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,891
Shit.

426
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,497
Did you get
the lady fingers?

427
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,082
Nah, they were out.

428
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,251
I got crumb cake,
the Entenmann's.

429
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,505
Disposal again?
Leave it,

430
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,674
I told you, I gotta
get the flange.

431
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,092
When, St. Smithen's day?

432
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,679
Who was at
the door before?

433
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,806
That lady from
the other day.

434
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,600
Catherine?

435
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,101
The one with
the manicotti.

436
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,728
I said you were sleeping.

437
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,896
Why didn't you wake me?

438
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,193
Roberta Sanfilippo
didn't call back, did she?

439
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,821
I gotta be honest, Junior,

440
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,824
When I ran into her at
Fountains of Wayne that time,

441
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,659
she was very cold.

442
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,538
What was she buying?

443
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,875
Fountain, kid pissing.

444
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,752
Must've bought a house.

445
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,171
Great ass.

446
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:13,797
Jesus.

447
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,508
Talked too much,
but what a piece she was.

448
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,594
Game as they come.

449
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,098
Listen, I'm gonna go.

450
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,600
Gotta take my kid to karate.

451
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,360
No, I read it, I did.

452
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,487
That's it,
that's the way of life.

453
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,406
But in "Angela's Ashes" you
were laughing with him at least.

454
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,660
Every paycheck
squandered on alcohol.

455
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,953
Please, you know
the Irish and their liquor.

456
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,748
The "weakness"
he calls it, right?

457
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,043
How he can make such
heartache funny is beyond me.

458
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,087
My god, with that father?

459
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,172
It's true, we don't know
what poverty is in this country.

460
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,508
Did you feel in this one the mother
came off a little nicer?

461
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,801
It's all in the writing.

462
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,345
It's like he makes
certain choices about

463
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,055
how he is going
to portray people.

464
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,973
Like the nuns
in that convent.

465
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,892
Please, Catholic school here
wasn't any better.

466
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,519
He used to be
a school teacher, you know.

467
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,770
Some school
in Manhattan.

468
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,316
My god, the way
he treated that wife.

469
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,194
She'd be better off
if he beat her.

470
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,658
Hello.

471
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,410
Yeah T, it's me.

472
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,327
Hey.

473
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,414
Listen, that container came in.

474
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,832
From the other side.

475
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,376
Supposed to
go to that guy...

476
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,586
Great, about fucking time.

477
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,881
It's better than she said,
it's un-fuckin'-believable.

478
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,843
It's all original
World War II shit.

479
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,261
You're fucking
kidding me.

480
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,387
I know nothing!

481
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,555
Nothing!

482
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,518
Ton, I am looking at the fucking
history channel here.

483
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,894
You gotta
come down here.

484
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,396
You'll love this stuff.

485
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,064
Nah.

486
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,025
We got Eisenhower's
dinnerware

487
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,153
from allied headquarters
in London.

488
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,282
We got a couple of Hermann Goering's
personal pearl-handled Lugers,

489
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,742
And get this...

490
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,537
We got the jeep that Patton
drove around in, in Sicily.

491
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,790
We have ways of dealing
with you, Mr. Soprano!

492
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,167
Ahh...!

493
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,460
Put that thing down.

494
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,878
Put that down, its expensive.

495
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,337
No, I better listen to the lawyer.

496
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,422
Are you sure?

497
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,007
Yeah.

498
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,633
You guys go ahead without me.

499
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,094
All right, talk to you later.

500
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,471
All right.

501
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,389
How 'bout a mystery?

502
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,892
The mystery
is that Rosalie read the "Ya-Ya Sisterhood"

503
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,773
What? I liked it.

504
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,526
What about something
like "Cider House Rules"?

505
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,029
Yeah, but not so sad.

506
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,080
So, how's that
English class going?

507
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,000
Comparative Literature, whatever.

508
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,211
Comp. Lit.
was last semester.

509
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,216
I told you I'm taking Lacan,
deconstructive theory.

510
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,386
Ooh, deconstructivist,
excuse me.

511
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,062
Incredible, they could care less.

512
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,067
This is delicious.

513
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,820
And your grandfather
a contractor.

514
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,406
Deconstructivism.

515
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,449
Ah.

516
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,327
My droll mom.

517
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,290
Excuse me, could you
move your cigarette?

518
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,417
Pardon me?

519
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,711
It's blowing
into my son's face.

520
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,712
Thank you.

521
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,172
We're allowed to smoke.

522
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,718
Unfortunately an area where
New Jersey is woefully behind,

523
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,387
but could you move it?

524
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,721
Mom, it's no big deal.

525
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,932
It's no big deal
to move it either.

526
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,267
I don't think so.

527
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,643
I'm sorry?

528
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,144
I'm not gonna move it.

529
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,521
Why not?

530
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,273
Because you're very rude.

531
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,609
I said "excuse me,"
quite clearly.

532
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,777
Your tone.

533
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,071
It's a health hazard,
move it.

534
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,447
No.

535
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,241
I'm a physician,

536
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,452
do you know what you're
doing to the rest of us?

537
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,997
My son has taken the trouble
in his own life,

538
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,957
to live in
a smoke-free dorm.

539
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,542
My salutations.

540
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,459
Mom.

541
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,920
This isn't
a smoke-free restaurant.

542
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:26,049
Look, this is silly, could you
just move the fucking thing?

543
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,801
Not when you
talk like that.

544
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,137
Just move
the cigarette, please?

545
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,054
No.

546
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,180
No?

547
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,140
No.

548
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,308
Mom!

549
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,517
Well?

550
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,768
You bitch.

551
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,270
She must be drunk.

552
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,730
Excuse me,
what did you say?

553
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,356
Ma'am, c'mon.

554
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,567
I saw what happened
let's just, shall we?

555
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,359
Will you call the police?

556
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't think that's warranted,
but ma'am...

557
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,238
Oh, no, please,
call the police,

558
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,908
because I'm not the one
with a lethal weapon here.

559
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,328
Ma'am, I'd like
you to leave.

560
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,880
C'mon, Jason.

561
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,465
I'm outta here.

562
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,398
Hello.

563
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,608
In here.

564
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,817
Uncle Jun'?

565
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,444
In here, the kitchen!

566
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,574
Where you been?

567
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,910
I've been calling you
all afternoon.

568
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,913
My fucking hand
is stuck down the drain.

569
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,082
And I can't reach
the fucking phone.

570
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,336
Good thing I'm nice, 'cause
I could start tickling you.

571
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,837
Jesus Christ.

572
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,756
How long you been
standing there?

573
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,049
Six hours!

574
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,344
Now get the fucking detergent
and lubricate my wrist!

575
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,347
Motherfuckin'
son of a bitch.

576
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,393
I thought you were Bobby.

577
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,520
Why didn't you
just call a plumber?

578
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,648
With what,
my fucking toes?!

579
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,401
Relax.

580
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,568
Relax.

581
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,487
Let it go limp.

582
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,990
Limp, you're flexing!

583
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,324
Let it go limp.

584
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:15,993
Limp.

585
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,495
That's it,
you're flexing.

586
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,331
Limp, that's it,
simmer down.

587
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,749
Simmer down.

588
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,459
Easy.

589
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,088
Oh, Jesus
fucking Christ.

590
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,674
Oh, this fucking house.

591
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,175
I'm dying here.

592
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,095
Just take it easy, okay?

593
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,103
You're coming to the engagement
party at least, right?

594
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,813
We'll get special permission.

595
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,816
I'll make some coffee.

596
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,610
I don't give a shit
if you do or you don't.

597
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,371
It's light.

598
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,915
You got your nephew
to thank for that.

599
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,083
What do you mean?

600
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,337
I ran into him the other day
at the garbage men's ball,

601
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,131
whatever the fuck it is.

602
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,218
He said we can't sell coke
on the route anymore.

603
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,136
What?

604
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,345
That's what he said.

605
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,765
I guess nobody
should eat, but him.

606
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,808
You should have seen him
in the golf outfit,

607
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,436
he looked like
Wallace Beery.

608
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,023
Where does he
get the effrontery?

609
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,941
He's the boss.

610
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,986
Whether he has
grand mals or not.

611
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,946
And this shit
is okay with you?

612
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,407
I know how much
you love him, JR.

613
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,078
I don't want to say
anything disparaging.

614
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,627
You know how it is,
they're bureaucrats,

615
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,836
they nit, they pick.

616
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,546
It's passive-aggressive,
pure and simple.

617
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,632
They have their lives,
themselves.

618
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,343
I know, I know,
they're not out in the field.

619
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,970
What can I do?
It's mandatory.

620
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,056
Okay, hold on.

621
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,060
Connie, get me the paperwork
on the separation requirements

622
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,019
for New Jersey.

623
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,354
Where is it?

624
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,690
I don't know, I put them
with the recycling files.

625
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,529
Can I get you something?

626
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,280
Coffee?

627
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,407
No.

628
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,659
No, I'm all right.

629
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,037
I'll be going home soon.

630
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,800
I embarrassed my son.

631
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,636
How's he supposed to know,

632
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,556
where this type
of behavior is coming from?

633
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,184
Think it's time you considered
a 12-step program?

634
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,979
I'm not an alcoholic, Elliot.

635
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,941
Besides, I have you, this.

636
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,444
Therapy isn't a substitute,
you know that.

637
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,246
I won't drink
with my son anymore.

638
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,291
We're bargaining now?

639
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,127
I'll go to a meeting.

640
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,093
I'm also
prescribing Luvox.

641
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,720
Luvox?

642
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,556
Is for OCD.

643
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,557
Among other things,

644
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,143
I've had success with it treating
other compulsions as well.

645
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,270
Compulsions?
Elliot, c'mon.

646
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,022
Your patient, Jennifer,

647
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,066
your inability to bring
the therapy to a conclusion.

648
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:41,072
Elliot, I honestly believe
that he's not ready.

649
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,158
Refer him to another doctor.

650
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,618
You really think that I'm...

651
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,994
Obsessed?

652
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,172
Luvox.

653
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,387
Jesus Christ.

654
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,017
That coke provides
a nice income stream.

655
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,603
Do you have any ideas
the bills I got?

656
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,272
Just keep it away
from the garbage routes.

657
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,233
The lawyers, the doctors,
the prescriptions,

658
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,360
a double sawbuck
for a plastic pillow,

659
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,070
just so I can
sit comfortably.

660
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,614
Why don't you just sit on that
nice pile of cash you got?

661
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,076
My finances are nobody's
goddamn business.

662
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,953
And that garbage
is my business.

663
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,872
I don't want you and that
other shit-bird fucking it up.

664
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,249
Your business.

665
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,418
Yeah, why don't you get that
through that bald dome of yours?

666
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,298
Why does everything
have to be so difficult?

667
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,928
You know, back in the '50s
we worked together.

668
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,682
Even rival families settled
their differences, amicably.

669
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,142
Oh yeah, I remember that picture
of Albert Anastasia lying there

670
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,353
all amicable
on the barbershop floor.

671
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,898
There were exceptions,
I'm just saying.

672
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,319
Oh, I'm sorry,
should I come back?

673
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,779
It's all right.

674
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,614
We're done here.

675
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,118
Bad night last night, huh?

676
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,621
Let's see if we can't get you a more
comfortable fit on this mask.

677
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,416
That little cupcake,
she never came back.

678
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,502
The one with the mask.

679
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,837
Tracey?

680
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,757
Sent her a bottle
of Shalimar.

681
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,593
She never mentioned it.

682
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,514
You should be happy at least,

683
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,100
the stent was
a complete success.

684
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,603
Let's not tempt fate
by taxing the heart.

685
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,398
How many migs
you shoot down last week?

686
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,539
Where's that
fucking manicotti?

687
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,958
It's gone.

688
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,002
Half a fucking
tray in there!

689
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,253
I was hungry.

690
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,881
Son of a bitch.

691
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,884
It's not my fault
you got your hand caught.

692
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,260
Why do you have
to be so nasty?

693
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,573
Directory assistant,
what listing?

694
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,202
Belleville, I need a number
for a Catherine Romano.

695
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,788
Thank you,
for what city?

696
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,165
Cocksucker, Belleville!

697
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,710
Please hold for an operator.

698
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,674
Any allergies, shellfish, perhaps?

699
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,259
No, I eat shrimp all the time.

700
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:52,013
MSG? Any change in medication?

701
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,847
No.

702
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,851
A new laundry detergent,
something like that?

703
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,354
I don't know,
I don't think so.

704
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,525
Have you been under
any undue stress lately?

705
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,276
Is that the only word
you people know?

706
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,154
Sometimes pressure can result
in contact dermatitis.

707
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,572
Oh, is that
what that is?

708
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,199
See, now I knew
that was bad.

709
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,575
It means rash.

710
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,496
Look at it,
it's bleeding, for Chris sake.

711
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,081
You've been
scratching it.

712
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,960
You said you work at
a sanitation transfer station.

713
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,005
Dollars to donuts, you're being
exposed to an irritant in the air.

714
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,091
I sit in an office.

715
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,053
I'll write you a scrip
for Cortisone cream.

716
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,268
Dr. Cusamano tells me you've been
seeing a psychotherapist.

717
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,728
So?

718
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,607
I suggest you talk about
stress management with him.

719
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,801
To tell the truth,

720
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,928
I was surprised
to hear from you.

721
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,348
I was sorry we
missed our visit.

722
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,059
I had the feeling
you weren't interested.

723
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,935
No.

724
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:21,978
No.

725
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,231
I stopped by the other day,
but I guess you were out.

726
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,649
It was odd.

727
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,776
I thought I heard
you hollering.

728
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,072
Funny how life works.

729
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,824
The different paths.

730
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,367
Yeah.

731
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,706
All leading to the cemetery.

732
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,300
Can I ask you
something, Corrado?

733
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,886
Was my Lou ever...

734
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,972
You know, on the take?

735
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
No, of course not.

736
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,853
Why would you ask
such a thing?

737
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,398
Sometimes you know,
I'd find money.

738
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,528
Hundreds of dollars, cash,
in his pockets at night.

739
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,530
Probably won it
at the racetrack.

740
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,615
You think so?

741
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,116
Sure, why not?

742
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,912
Somebody has to win.

743
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,049
Well, the kitchen needs
some work but, you know,

744
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,468
a little marble,
maybe some new fixtures.

745
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,012
It's nice.

746
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,683
You think he'll come
down on the price?

747
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,142
I don't know.

748
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,062
Tony, it's your sister,

749
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,772
would it kill you to
take a little interest?

750
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,107
I'm here, ain't I?

751
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,733
Sorry we're late.

752
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,570
The paper says
Fox Hill lane,

753
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,863
she takes me to Stag Trail road.

754
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,326
Not bad, huh, Carm?
Oh, wow.

755
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,954
If we have kids, ma's house
is just not big enough.

756
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,416
And like Tony says,
it's not our house anyway.

757
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,959
Come here, you gotta
see this bedroom.

758
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,961
You can make a den
out of the closet.

759
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,803
Talked to my uncle
the other day, Rich.

760
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,890
Yeah, I heard.

761
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,980
So we're clear on this
drug shit, right, Richie?

762
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,942
Now, the reason I'm asking you,
850 grand's a pretty big nut.

763
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,360
I don't know
if your parole job

764
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,987
at the fish market's
gonna cover it.

765
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,572
Tell me about it.

766
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,412
These walls, skim-coat.

767
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,832
Not that plain sheetrock shit.

768
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,377
They put in a lawn
this year, it's new.

769
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,714
When'd you put
your lawn in?

770
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,091
Richie.

771
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,386
This is a great school district.

772
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,182
Are you all right?

773
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,809
I gotta go.

774
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:07,810
What's the matter?

775
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,853
Nothing, just...

776
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,107
I feel hot.

777
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,070
Oh my god, you're all clammy,
let's get you home.

778
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,989
No, no, you stay with them,
and help them.

779
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,784
I'll see you later.

780
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,526
Oh, you poor bastard.

781
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,784
Hey Tony, you got a minute?

782
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,328
Yeah, sure, what's up?

783
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,581
What are you doing?

784
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,917
Organizing a basketball pool,

785
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,544
for the people in the office.

786
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,130
Yeah, sounds great, should be fun.

787
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,047
Yeah.

788
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,259
I got a call from
a friend of mine in Nutley.

789
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,468
Guy's a cop.

790
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,888
They got Richie's
driver on video.

791
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,767
He sold three ounces of coke
at an arcade down there.

792
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,978
It's all right,
I talked to Richie.

793
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,731
This was last night.

794
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,695
Guess we'll have to
torch a truck or something.

795
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,656
Oh, but you don't
want to hear that.

796
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,618
And I sure as shit
didn't say it.

797
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,713
Dick, I'm trying to work
on this office pool.

798
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,798
Sure, I'll leave you alone.

799
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,792
Hello.

800
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,251
Corrado?

801
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,629
What the fuck are you doing
calling my home?

802
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,838
Now listen,

803
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,467
I am the only person in
this family who doesn't curse,

804
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,677
so, just do me the favor.

805
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,014
I want to see how you're feeling.

806
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,516
Is that so horrible?

807
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,642
I'm fine.

808
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,311
It's not easy being
abandoned, is it?

809
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,647
Look to yourself.

810
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,942
I had a stroke, Corrado,
did you hear?

811
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,986
Of course I heard,
I don't live in Oshkosh.

812
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,863
And I heard

813
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,158
you're keeping company
with that Catherine Romano.

814
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,493
What the fuck?

815
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,536
Never you mind
about that.

816
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,621
Aw, she's so sweet.

817
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,624
I remember my Johnny told me,

818
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,670
she let him feel her up
behind "The Sons of Italy" hall.

819
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,506
Listen Livia, what you
don't know could fill a book.

820
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,397
Is everything all right?

821
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,315
My brother's wife.

822
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,693
Oh Livia, how is she?

823
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,986
I heard she wasn't well.

824
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,279
She never was well.

825
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,780
Let's face it.

826
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,074
That woman's life is very sad.

827
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,660
If she fell into a sewer pipe,

828
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,079
she'd come up holding
a gold watch in each hand.

829
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,419
This was my father's.

830
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,880
Actually it
was his uncle's.

831
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,508
It's a little sweet, but there's
nothing like homemade wine.

832
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,678
The vinegar eggplant.

833
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,471
From four years ago.

834
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,598
Take some home.

835
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,892
I can't handle the acidity.

836
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,855
If you like, I can
make us some lunch.

837
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,732
Why go to the bother,

838
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,859
there's a Friendly's
on Bloomfield avenue.

839
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,069
I can't.

840
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,031
Don't you enjoy
going out Corrado?

841
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,116
It's not that
I don't enjoy it.

842
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,911
Well, what is it then,
your heart?

843
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,081
No, it's certain legal difficulties.

844
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,459
The truth is I can't go out.

845
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,169
I'm under house arrest.

846
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,422
Oh my god, does it hurt?

847
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,715
It beeps.

848
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,347
Sends a signal
if I leave the house.

849
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,806
You can't go anywhere?

850
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,977
The choices we make, huh?

851
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,480
Occasionally I can
get special permission.

852
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,858
Banking, the doctors,
certain family obligations.

853
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,110
For the most part though...

854
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,323
I understand if you
don't want to stay.

855
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,868
I enjoy you, Corrado,
I always did.

856
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,080
You stay,
I'll bring food in.

857
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,464
Trying to keep a low profile,
what's the fucking point?

858
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,843
I'm still a miserable prick,
and I'm still passing out.

859
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,975
Thing on the History Channel
the other night,

860
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,601
on the American Revolution.

861
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,354
You know we're the only
country in the world

862
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,858
where the pursuit of happiness
is guaranteed in writing?

863
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,987
You believe that, hmm?

864
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,990
Bunch of fucking spoiled brats.

865
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,784
Where's my happiness then?

866
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,036
It's the pursuit that's guaranteed.

867
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,330
Always a fucking loophole, right?

868
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,089
Well, you seem
very mellow today.

869
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,883
Let's talk about you.

870
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,886
You seem like you're on drugs,
and I'm boring myself to death.

871
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,180
I'm ready for the George Sanders
long walk here.

872
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,144
Do you know why
a shark keeps moving?

873
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,522
They gotta keep moving
or they'll die,

874
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,232
they can't breathe
or something.

875
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:32,236
There's a psychological
condition known as Alexithymia,

876
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,739
common in certain personalities.

877
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,327
The individual craves
almost ceaseless action,

878
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,540
which enables them
to avoid acknowledging

879
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,293
the abhorrent things they do.

880
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,502
Abhorrent?

881
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,549
What certain personalities?

882
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,343
Antisocial personalities.

883
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,020
My future brother-in-law...

884
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,151
Ran over a guy, no reason.

885
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:16,572
Guy's paralyzed, has to
piss into a cathode tube.

886
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,582
What happens when these
antisocial personalities

887
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,711
aren't distracted from
the horrible shit they do?

888
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,464
They have time to think
about their behavior.

889
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,093
How what they do
affects other people.

890
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,516
About feelings of emptiness
and self-loathing,

891
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,267
haunting them since childhood.

892
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,441
And they crash.

893
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,658
Which one of them knew?

894
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,827
Knew what?

895
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,246
Jerry Grill had asthma...

896
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,542
He never was one
to let common sense

897
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,710
get in the way of
whatever he wanted to do.

898
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,924
What about Chris Newman?

899
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,845
Grale's house was the last thing
standing in the way of that new deli.

900
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,888
I'm sure Chris is glad
to see him gone too.

901
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,056
What about Howard?

902
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,808
Corrado.

903
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,268
Hmm?

904
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,604
I got caught in
the middle of the fight...

905
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,858
And you have
no broken bones?

906
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,443
Actually they ignored me.

907
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,279
Fucking thing.

908
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,866
Shh, with that talk.

909
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,161
...That he'd been cheatin' on her

910
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,287
Where'd you hear that?

911
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,914
Her father told her
while I was standing there.

912
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,083
Every one of them
had a motive.

913
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,044
The thing is who
had the opportunity,

914
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,172
and who was it who knew
that he had asthma?

915
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,225
I threw.

916
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,102
C'mon.

917
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,899
Ho, our long lost leader.

918
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,775
Somebody most owe him money.

919
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,360
Tony, how you doing?

920
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,112
How's the clay pigeon?

921
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,822
I'm getting there.

922
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,368
You could knock Cardozo
Law school all you want,

923
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,246
but his lawyer says
the gun charge will not stick.

924
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,539
Yeah, congratulations.

925
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,960
We were just talking
about you know, down the docks.

926
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,088
Driving off some off
that Japanese technology.

927
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,423
Hesh knows a guy.

928
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,883
Oh, yeah?

929
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,429
So, what else is going on?

930
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,682
Nothing.

931
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,862
I'm having good luck with Swiss
Basics' Moisturizing Formula.

932
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,242
Maybe I'll try it.

933
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,371
Oh!

934
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,375
Yeah!

935
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,126
Goodbye.

936
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,259
What the fuck?

937
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,474
Holy shit.

938
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,101
Look at that.

939
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,103
It's that dipshit Carmine again.

940
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,314
Sil, go tell him no speeding
in the neighborhood.

941
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,023
I'm on it.

942
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,732
C'mon.

943
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,276
What an asshole.

944
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,820
Carmine, what the
fuck's the matter with you?

945
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,280
How many times
We gotta tell you,

946
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,365
do not speed in this
fucking neighborhood?!

947
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,290
C'mon, you hurt?

948
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,040
That's too bad,

949
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,584
you should be fucking crippled,
you fucking asshole!

950
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,837
Don't do that again,
you understand me?!

951
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,671
Understand me?

952
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,090
People could be fucking hurt,
you know that?

953
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,049
You know that?

954
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,217
You all right?

955
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,510
You sure?

956
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,347
Tony.

957
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,725
Oh, Agent Harris.

958
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,934
How are you?

959
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,810
Good, good to see you.

960
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,021
I was in the neighborhood, I wanted
to introduce you to my new partner.

961
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,897
Joe Marquez, Tony Soprano.

962
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,358
What's the matter,
no openings in the post office?

963
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,320
How 'bout those Nets, huh?

964
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,529
What a series.

965
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,239
It's that guy, Williams.

966
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,365
Yeah, he's good.

967
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,576
That fourth quarter was amazing.

968
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,119
How'd the Knicks do?

969
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,829
It was close, really close.

970
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,998
Look at this asshole.

971
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,124
Friend of yours?

972
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,169
He drives too fast, and he's
always fucking hitting shit.
