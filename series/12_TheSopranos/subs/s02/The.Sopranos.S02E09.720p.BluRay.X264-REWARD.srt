1
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,225
Hiya, sweetie.

2
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,521
They took the tube out of his throat.
Now he's breathing on his own.

3
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,440
He took a lot of damage to his spleen.

4
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,026
- They might take it out.
- Oh, my God.

5
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,945
- I know.
- Jeez.

6
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,864
I'm so scared.

7
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,490
Hey, listen, listen.

8
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,827
This guy, he's a tough kid.

9
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,873
If anybody can make it through
something like this, it's Christopher.

10
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,625
Look, you got His Holiness.
That's good.

11
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,003
He got shot too and survived.

12
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,966
Look what they did to my son!
My son, those sons of bitches!

13
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,426
Fucking vodka.

14
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,015
When you find him, I want him
to suffer, you hear me, Sil?

15
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,642
I want that motherfucker in agony!

16
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,228
Don't worry.
We'll do the best we can.

17
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,191
Gismonte, with a G.

18
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,484
The kid who died, right?

19
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,487
- What, you never heard of him?
- No.

20
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,616
Him and his friend, Bevilaqua,
ran with Moltisanti.

21
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,452
You never saw him hanging out
with Christopher?

22
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,957
You don't want to help your friend?

23
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,095
Hey.

24
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,060
I thought they were
moving him out of the ICU.

25
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,021
- They think he's getting better.
- We've gotta pray.

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,689
Hey, you gotta pray.

27
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,567
We are. Jesus.

28
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,654
I don't know what
I would do, Uncle Rich.

29
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,489
I love him so much.

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,449
He's gonna make it.

31
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,871
I don't want that fuck here.
I told him that.

32
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,040
He's full of negative energies.

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,919
He said he'd only come back here
if he had something on Matthew.

34
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,140
- Start talking.
- Back the fuck off.

35
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,768
All right. What do you got, Rich?

36
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:36,024
The word is definitely out
on the street on this Bevilaqua kid.

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,904
Tommy Biondi from OTB
came up with a name.

38
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,991
A dealer named Quickie G.

39
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,451
He's been in the Bing a few times.

40
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,330
Or it might have been
this other prick, Fast Fatty.

41
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,584
I'm telling you, this won't take long.

42
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,172
I give Bevilaqua five days before
somebody brings his ass to us...

43
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,258
...to score points.

44
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,679
My brother was in this hospital.
The bill was 75 pages long.

45
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,348
Eight dollars for an aspirin.

46
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,395
You hear about Ralph and Mary Ritaldo?

47
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,688
No, what happened?

48
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,607
Ralphie's had this
Brazilian goomar for years.

49
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,028
- A dancer, right?
- She just gave birth to Ralph's baby.

50
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,155
A C-section.

51
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,418
Hey.

52
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,795
Why don't you try and get some sleep?

53
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,464
Why?

54
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,966
Why?

55
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,720
Tomorrow's gonna be
another rough day, that's why.

56
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,225
I don't think I'll sleep tonight.
Will this light bother you?

57
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,185
No.

58
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,104
Good night.

59
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,486
Tony?

60
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,323
I love you, Tony.

61
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,451
I don't want anybody getting hurt.

62
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,662
Not me, not the kids, not you...

63
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,290
I can't do one
of these tearful things...

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,877
...till 5:00 in the morning tonight.
I just can't.

65
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,712
Not tonight.

66
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,884
Did you hear about Ralphie Ritaldo?

67
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,973
- What about him?
- The Brazilian he keeps on the side?

68
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,519
Yeah?

69
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,062
She had a baby.

70
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,940
Christopher's in the ICU.
This is on your mind?

71
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,110
Maybe it has to do
with the CK One on your shirt.

72
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,737
- It's over. Months ago.
- Yeah, right.

73
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,948
Yeah, right what? I cut it off!

74
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,118
Listen, Tony, if you're gonna
keep doing what you do...

75
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,496
...then, at the very least,
I want you to get a vasectomy.

76
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,707
- You want me to do what?
- Let's get real, Tony.

77
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,002
You know what a bastard child
would do to this family?

78
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,006
Think about the shame we'd feel.
You're putting us all at risk.

79
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,225
Hey, I had her tested for AIDS.

80
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,227
What do you think I am?

81
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,730
Code Blue, ICU 3.

82
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,899
Code Blue, ICU 3.

83
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,870
No! Oh, my God! Chrissy!

84
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,330
No! He's gonna die!

85
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,248
No, he's gonna be okay.

86
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,169
It's not fair!
They said he was gonna get better!

87
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,298
No, let go of me! No!

88
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,644
Yeah?

89
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,312
What?

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,417
How is he?

91
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,836
His heart stopped.

92
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,175
They're working
their asses off on him.

93
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,843
All right.

94
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:19,224
Well, we gotta stay positive, right?

95
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,518
We gotta give him that.

96
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,854
Positive vibes only.

97
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,221
Gentle and merciful Lord Jesus.

98
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,391
I want to speak to You now
with an open heart.

99
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,643
With an honest heart.

100
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,772
Tonight I ask You to take my sins...

101
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,776
...and the sins of my family
into Your merciful heart.

102
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,113
We have chosen this life
in full awareness...

103
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,907
...of the consequences of our sins.

104
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,161
I know that Christopher's life
is in Your hands.

105
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,080
And his fate is Your will.

106
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,294
I ask You humbly to spare him.

107
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,048
And if it is Your will to spare him...

108
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,593
...I ask that You deliver him
from blindness...

109
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,137
...and grant him vision.

110
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,058
And through this vision,
may he see Your love...

111
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,063
...and gain the strength to carry on
in service to Your mercy.

112
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,198
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

113
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,741
Amen.

114
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,623
If I had any reservations,
I'd suggest we move him now.

115
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,542
This is the best trauma unit
in the Tri-State.

116
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,671
- I'm up on all the ratings.
- Oh, thanks, Hesh.

117
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,966
There's no news yet.

118
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,681
Tony, it's Dr. Rubin.

119
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,017
Mr. Moltisanti suffered cardiac
and respiratory arrest...

120
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,812
...due to internal bleeding.
He was resuscitated.

121
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,108
The bleeding was brought under
control. He's in stable condition.

122
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,903
- What was the duration of the arrest?
- About a minute.

123
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,407
- He still intubated?
- They're removing the ventilator now.

124
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,867
What the fuck you two talking about?

125
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,080
The worst is over. But he was
clinically dead for about a minute.

126
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,249
Doctor, can I go see him?

127
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,960
No, he'll be in post-op
for about five hours.

128
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,796
Then he's asked to speak
with Mr. Gualtieri.

129
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,718
- Me?
- He asked for you and Mr. Soprano.

130
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,232
Christopher.

131
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,650
Hey.

132
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,278
I'm sorry, T.

133
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,238
For what?

134
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,366
I know you're mad at me.

135
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:28,163
What are you talking about?
I'm not mad at you. Nobody is.

136
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,459
I'm going to hell, T.

137
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:38,381
- You're not going anywhere but home.
- I crossed over to the other side.

138
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,049
You what?

139
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,135
I saw the tunnel...

140
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,262
...and a white light.

141
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,766
- I saw my father in hell.
- Get the fuck outta here.

142
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,311
The bouncer said that I'd be there
too when my time comes.

143
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,481
- What bouncer?
- The Emerald Piper.

144
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,941
That's our hell.

145
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,155
It's an Irish bar where it's
St. Patrick's Day every day forever.

146
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,160
Mikey Palmice and Brendan Filone
were there too.

147
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,120
They were friends.

148
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,247
Those two guys hated each other.

149
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,917
You gotta relax.
You just need some rest.

150
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,752
They're friends now.

151
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,632
They were playing dice with two Roman
soldiers and a bunch of Irish guys.

152
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,050
Doesn't make sense.

153
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,512
And the Irish,
they were winning every roll.

154
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,140
And then Mikey gave me
a message for both of you.

155
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,433
A message.

156
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,435
Yeah.

157
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,104
Yeah, he said:

158
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,484
"Tell Tony and Paulie, 3:00."

159
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,194
Three o'clock?

160
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,656
This fucking morphine drip.
I don't think it's working.

161
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,368
- I don't feel a fucking thing.
- You gotta be careful with that.

162
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,745
- That was all he said?
- Who?

163
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,247
Mikey. Three o'clock?

164
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,957
Yeah.

165
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,376
What was he wearing?

166
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,798
Come on, let's go. He needs his rest.

167
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,758
He had on a gangster suit.

168
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,969
Pinstripe.

169
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,680
Old-fashioned style.

170
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,889
Hey...

171
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,100
That was a dream.

172
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,936
Forget about it. Okay?

173
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,021
I'm gonna take you home soon.

174
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,405
Do they know this kid likes
his chemistry set too much?

175
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,491
He's in pain.
What the fuck else they gonna do?

176
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,416
What time was Mikey hit?

177
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,128
How the fuck do I know?
You were there.

178
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,298
It was in the morning, right?
Eleven, ten?

179
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,189
All right, so I cheat.
I used to cheat.

180
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,610
I'm not getting spayed.
End of subject.

181
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,155
You brought up the vasectomy.
Now you don't want to talk.

182
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,240
You asked me what was going on.

183
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,124
I saw on the news
about a gangland shooting.

184
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:20,793
Yeah.

185
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,340
Is that your nephew Christopher
that you've spoken of before?

186
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,929
The papers said he was
in critical condition.

187
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,805
It'll be fine.

188
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,642
Have they found the person
that shot him yet?

189
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,644
No. Have you?

190
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,314
I'm not trying to pry
into that part of your life.

191
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,232
I know our deal.

192
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,737
But I've heard you say before
that you love this young man.

193
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,121
Christopher was...

194
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,749
...clinically dead...

195
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,918
...for about a minute.

196
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,340
He thinks he had one of those
near-death experiences.

197
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,884
Says he visited hell...

198
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,762
...and they told him
he'd be back permanent.

199
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,097
Who's "they"?

200
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,352
It's bullshit. It was a dream
combined with the morphine.

201
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,897
He thinks he's going to hell.
He's all fucked up over it.

202
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,108
Do you think he'll go to hell?

203
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,317
No.

204
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,242
He's not the type that deserves hell.

205
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,703
Who do you think does?

206
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,413
The worst people.

207
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,042
The twisted and demented psychos
who kill people for pleasure.

208
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:48,214
Cannibals, degenerate molesters,
torturers and killers of babies.

209
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,552
The Hitlers, the Pol Pots. They're
the evil fucks that deserve to die.

210
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,262
Not my nephew.

211
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,223
What about you?

212
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,474
What?

213
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,144
Hell?

214
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,522
You been listening to me?

215
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,026
No. For the same reasons.

216
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,448
We're soldiers, you know.
Soldiers don't go to hell.

217
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,244
It's war. Soldiers,
they kill other soldiers.

218
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,372
We're in a situation...

219
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,167
...where everybody involved
knows the stakes.

220
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,794
And if you're gonna
accept those stakes...

221
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,382
...you gotta do certain things.

222
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,845
It's business. We're soldiers.

223
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,056
We follow codes.

224
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,932
Orders.

225
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,561
So does that justify
everything that you do?

226
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,481
Excuse me. When America
opened the floodgates...

227
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,526
...and let all us Italians in,
what do you think they did it for?

228
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,529
Because they were trying
to save us from poverty?

229
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,490
It was because they needed us.

230
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,952
They needed us to build their cities
and subways and to make them richer.

231
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,831
The Carnegies and Rockefellers
needed worker bees. There we were.

232
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,001
But some of us didn't
want to lose who we were.

233
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,796
We wanted to preserve
the important things:

234
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,091
Honor and family and loyalty.

235
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,010
Some of us wanted
a piece of the action.

236
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,180
Now we weren't educated
like the Americans...

237
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,891
...but we had the balls
to take what we wanted.

238
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,103
And those other fucks,
those other, the J.P. Morgans...

239
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,313
...they were crooks and killers too.

240
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,650
But that was the business, right?
The American way.

241
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,527
That might all be true.

242
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,531
But what do poor Italian immigrants
have to do with you...

243
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,034
...and what happens every morning
you step out of bed?

244
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,746
- What the fuck is all this?
- I'm just asking a question.

245
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,501
Oh, so you're taking a stand here now.
You pick here to make a stand?

246
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,922
After all this, telling me nothing's
my fault because of poor parenting...

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,383
...you pick now to be
Betsy-fucking-Ross?

248
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,970
My nephew's in the fucking hospital.
He might not get out.

249
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,447
What? Three o'clock again?

250
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,032
Quiet.

251
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,791
My wind chimes?

252
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,877
Sorry, hon.

253
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,796
Just don't wake up my kids, Paulie.

254
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,507
Motherfucker.

255
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,385
Baby...

256
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,972
...you gotta relax your thoughts.

257
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,933
Whatever Christopher saw...

258
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,477
...you can't take it personal.

259
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,522
Christopher's a troubled kid.

260
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,816
Who knows what's in his heart?

261
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,361
Come.

262
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,741
You're right.
I need to relax with this.

263
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,703
Let me help you.

264
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,251
- That is so weird.
- What the fuck you saying?

265
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,462
Three o'clock?

266
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,925
Kenny and I were supposed
to be married at 1:00...

267
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,969
...in the Fontainebleau Room
at the Roman Gardens.

268
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,514
Mikey and Jo-Jo had the
Bella Vista Room booked for 3:00.

269
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,935
The Bella Vista Room
is smaller with no windows.

270
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:33,856
A week before the wedding, Mikey saw
the Bella Vista Room and flipped out.

271
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,234
He almost killed the events manager.

272
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,736
So Mikey and Jo-Jo
got the Fontainebleau...

273
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,948
...and Kenny and me wound up
with the Bella Vista Room.

274
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,283
At 3:00.

275
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,144
Fuck.

276
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,148
Just trying to tidy up the place.
Go back to sleep.

277
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,110
Tidying up?

278
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,195
How you doing?

279
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,614
I'm doing.

280
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,409
I'll tell you...

281
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,371
...I'm still baffled
by this 3:00 thing, though.

282
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,959
I wish I had more for you,
but that's all he said.

283
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,590
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah?

284
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,553
That bouncer that sent you back,
did he have horns on his head?

285
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,684
He was just some big Irish goon
in old-fashioned clothes.

286
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,978
Did anybody there have horns?

287
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,731
Or buds for horns? Those goat bumps?

288
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,525
Paulie, it was fucking hell, okay?

289
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,530
My father said he loses
every hand of cards he plays.

290
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,741
And every midnight, they whack him...

291
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,286
...the same way he was whacked
in life, and it's painful.

292
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,999
Night after night. Does that sound
like fucking heaven to you?

293
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,710
- Was it hot?
- Yeah.

294
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,546
I don't know. What the fuck?

295
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,549
Heat's the first thing you'd notice.
Hell is hot.

296
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,010
That's never been disputed by anybody.

297
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:30,264
You didn't go to hell.
You went to purgatory, my friend.

298
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,352
I forgot all about purgatory.

299
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,187
Purgatory.

300
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,648
A little detour
on the way to paradise.

301
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:45,446
- How long you think we stay there?
- Now that's different for everybody.

302
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,617
You add up all your mortal sins
and multiply that number by 50.

303
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,830
Then you add up all your venial sins
and multiply that by 25.

304
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,708
You add them together,
that's your sentence.

305
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,088
I figure I have to do about 6000 years
before I get accepted into heaven.

306
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,257
And 6000 years is nothing
in eternity terms.

307
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,052
I can do that standing on my head.

308
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,846
It's like a couple of days here.

309
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,684
Was I insensitive?

310
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,438
And, perhaps,
did I do it deliberately?

311
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,775
Do I hate him?

312
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,028
How often are you taking the Ativan?

313
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,781
Almost every night.

314
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,908
And when else?

315
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,704
Sunday afternoon I took one.

316
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,458
There's another thing. I...

317
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,629
I've been drinking.

318
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,757
Alone.

319
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,884
I'm glad you're telling me.

320
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,270
Part of it is that I'm afraid.

321
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,815
I've told him my son is at Bard.

322
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,152
Why did you agree
to continue working with him?

323
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,154
We've discussed this, Elliot.

324
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,531
I took him back
because I felt it was...

325
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,493
...a professional and ethical
responsibility to do so.

326
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,123
Jennifer, I'm not challenging
your ability or professionalism...

327
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,958
...or even your ethics.

328
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,544
Then what are you challenging?

329
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,963
What you hope to achieve
with this man.

330
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:31,302
- What do you hope to achieve with me?
- No, that's a facile analogy.

331
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,186
I'm living in a moral
Never Never Land with this patient.

332
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,481
Not wanting to judge but to treat.

333
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,068
But now I've judged.

334
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,822
I took a position,
goddamn it, and I'm scared.

335
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,159
I feel for you.

336
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,098
You're late.

337
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,268
That go on my record?

338
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,938
It's common courtesy.
I got a life too.

339
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,649
- Yeah, lucky you.
- So, what do you got?

340
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,360
- I think he knows.
- Knows what?

341
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,154
- Or suspects.
- What are you talking about?

342
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,406
He looks at me different. Glances.

343
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,658
"Glances"?

344
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,493
We had sandwiches brought in.

345
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:42,373
Four with meats, one eggplant and
the other with tomato and mozzarella.

346
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,708
That's six.
There were only five of us.

347
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:49,255
Tony said he ordered the eggplant,
but I did. He ordered the tomato.

348
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,590
- Maybe he forgot.
- He never forgets.

349
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,841
What's your point?

350
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,719
He let me eat the eggplant.
He took the tomato.

351
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,721
- But there was a moment.
- A glance.

352
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,848
Yeah, a fucking glance!

353
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,309
This is simple.
I'm gonna help you out.

354
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,437
Keep in mind that you're
the one who's different.

355
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,774
You're seeing differently.
You got a new attitude.

356
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,278
I know the man.
He's the one who's different with me.

357
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,489
Odds don't favor it.
Either way, it doesn't matter.

358
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,659
- Yeah, to you.
- I wasn't the one selling heroin.

359
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,828
I wasn't the one pinched for it.

360
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,624
So, what do I do?

361
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,001
What do you do?

362
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,877
You do everything you can do.

363
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,382
Do what you do to a girl that you
want to fuck. Make him love you.

364
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,691
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.

365
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,194
What do you want for breakfast?

366
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,948
- You don't wake up till lunch, Mom.
- Tomorrow I'll get up early.

367
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,743
How about the peppers
and eggs and bread?

368
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,203
- That sounds great, Ma.
- Okay.

369
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,874
- Do you need more time alone, Jo?
- No. I'm ready.

370
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,791
Okay, Chris.

371
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,085
Bye, Ma.

372
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,972
If you want to sleep, it's okay.
I brought a book.

373
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,350
No, I just got up 10 minutes ago.

374
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,644
And the painkillers aren't helping?

375
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,937
No, they're pretty fucking good.

376
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,151
I want to tell you
something, Christopher.

377
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,488
The other night,
when your heart stopped...

378
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:42,493
...I walked down the hall to a room
and I prayed to Jesus to spare you.

379
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,872
And that if He would spare you,
I asked that He grant you vision.

380
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,457
Sight.

381
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,669
So that you can see the way
to Christ clearly.

382
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,962
Yeah, so?

383
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,882
And He did spare you.

384
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,010
And you saw, Christopher.

385
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,887
You saw something.

386
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,015
Something that none of us
have ever seen.

387
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,273
- So, what did He say to you?
- Who?

388
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,067
Jesus.

389
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,069
I didn't see Jesus.

390
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,115
Tony said you saw Jesus and He took
you to see your father in heaven.

391
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,451
- Then He said it wasn't your time.
- I was in hell.

392
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
You what?

393
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:30,624
My father was in hell and they said
that's where I'd go when it's my time.

394
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,794
Maybe it was purgatory,
but I don't know.

395
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:46,932
Then you have to look at this
experience as a chance to repent.

396
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,060
To change your heart.

397
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:56,066
To start to walk in the light of
the Lord. You were blessed by this.

398
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,445
You were blessed with a second chance.

399
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,030
I don't know, Carmela.

400
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,032
Well, I do know.

401
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,369
And I am gonna pray
like I did the other night.

402
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,289
And I'm gonna pray
every day from now on.

403
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,042
It is not too late
for you, Christopher.

404
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,962
If you pray.

405
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,716
Will you pray?

406
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,971
Okay, you just have to follow me.

407
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,642
In the name of the Father...

408
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,019
...the Son...

409
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,271
...and the Holy Spirit.

410
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,370
How was he?

411
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,663
Fine.

412
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,248
Same.

413
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,841
So any news?

414
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,135
No.

415
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,605
So, what, we're not talking now?

416
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,942
I said what I had to say, Tony.

417
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,822
If you can't be honest with me, have
the balls to be honest with yourself.

418
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,575
I got balls. And as long as I do,
they will remain intact.

419
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,953
You don't have faith in me,
it's up to you.

420
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,374
You gotta prove it to yourself first.
Yourself and God.

421
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,002
You're only religious
when it suits you.

422
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,004
What is that supposed to mean?

423
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,924
Come here.

424
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,767
What's it mean?

425
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:58,230
The pope don't like Trojans yet you
want me cut. Isn't that hypocritical?

426
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,567
Look, I'm thinking of
my family first. That's all.

427
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:06,738
What's down here is God's creation.
Isn't it a sin to undo His work?

428
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,824
You should know.
You made a living of it.

429
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,622
You're un-fucking-believable,
you know that?

430
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,296
Look what I made that living for.

431
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,803
You had dinner an hour ago. What
the fuck are you doing to yourself!?

432
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,096
Leave him alone.

433
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,769
I'm supposed to get a vasectomy
when this is my heir?

434
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,396
Look at him.

435
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,108
Tony, come back here and apologize!

436
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,828
- You're dragging me to hell!
- What?

437
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,623
- You're dragging me to hell!
- Paulie! Paulie!

438
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,041
You had a nightmare.

439
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,502
Mommy, somebody was screaming.
I'm scared.

440
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,339
I know, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

441
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,966
Uncle Paulie had a bad dream.

442
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,593
Mommy.

443
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,679
Come here, baby.
It's all right. It's all right.

444
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,934
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm putting them to bed.

445
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:22,147
And I'm going home to sleep.
I don't need to keep everyone up.

446
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,361
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

447
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,446
Come talk to me.

448
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:44,294
- How much can you believe in dreams?
- Wait. Wrong.

449
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,421
Christopher did not have a dream.

450
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,174
A dream, I'd make my peace.

451
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,926
He was dead.

452
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,638
Science said he was dead. Science.

453
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:59,017
You need to talk to someone
who deals with this professionally.

454
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,519
What kind of thing?

455
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,230
He's in New York, Paulie.

456
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,315
In Nyack.

457
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,735
- His name's Cullen, a psychic.
- Get the fuck outta here.

458
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,155
He's famous for contacting
dead relatives for people.

459
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,742
He contacted my dead friend.
Remember Ronnie with the arm?

460
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,746
He knew about the fingers at the elbow,
and I didn't tell him.

461
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,750
He said, "Johnny is here."
I told him I didn't know any Johnnies.

462
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,587
But then he said, "Well, one arm
is shorter than the other.

463
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,132
Does that mean anything to you?"

464
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,677
Ronnie. It was Ronnie.

465
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,638
Jesus. A fucking creep show.

466
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,267
You got nothing to lose
except the nightmares.

467
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,693
- What's up, yo? Paulie around?
- No.

468
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,153
Sil?

469
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,365
What the fuck? I'm here.
You talk to me. You got something?

470
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,909
You better remember me, man.

471
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,787
Yeah, I will. Now you got something?

472
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,707
All right.

473
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,459
Hacklebarney State Park.

474
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,503
Where the "George Washington
slept here" house is.

475
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,839
Up that road, there's a gray house.

476
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,340
Bevilaqua's there?

477
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,342
Twenty bucks, baby.

478
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,150
Now, are you telling me that's
who you are or that's who he is?

479
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,571
I see.

480
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,867
Right.

481
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,372
The spirit put him on hold.

482
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,877
Do you take the name Gregory?

483
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,378
My father.

484
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:55,217
I understand now. You're Gregory.
This is your son.

485
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,595
- Is your name Daniel?
- Yes.

486
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:03,141
Because I got this image
of Daniel in the lion's den.

487
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,979
He says you found his body.

488
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,731
Oh, my God.

489
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,235
He's sorry.
He knows how traumatic that was.

490
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,114
He couldn't take the pain anymore.

491
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,541
Gregory, I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

492
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,427
He wants you to know...

493
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,807
...that he was there with you
and that you should move on.

494
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,935
Yes, go ahead.

495
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,822
What's the problem?

496
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,454
- What the hell's the matter?
- No, please, go on.

497
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,376
He can't hurt you. Don't be afraid.

498
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,922
I understand. Yes.

499
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,596
I feel your anger.

500
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,891
- Who the fuck are you talking to?
- Charles.

501
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,852
Yes, yes. You have a son.

502
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,690
- You're with your son?
- What the fuck? I don't got no kids!

503
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,151
Oh, Sonny.

504
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:41,156
- Pagano?
- Kind spirit, is your name Sonny?

505
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,910
Charles Pagano.

506
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:49,289
- How the fuck do you know that?
- He says he was your first.

507
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,916
But I feel many more.

508
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,251
- Hey!
- That one's laughing.

509
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,337
Poison ivy?

510
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,633
He wants to know if it still itches.

511
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,843
Who you been talking to?

512
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,137
You're gonna have to leave.

513
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,682
Why? What the fuck are they saying?

514
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,560
Do you really want me to say it?

515
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,146
Fuck you and this bullshit.

516
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,649
Because that's what this is, you know.

517
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,777
Satanic black magic. Sick shit.

518
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,656
I'm asking you to leave, sir.

519
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,992
Fucking queers!

520
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,135
When I made my appointment
I gave the name Ted Hughes.

521
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,847
Did you call him from your house?

522
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,809
I'm not a moron, T.

523
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,937
I knew this might be a scam...

524
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,648
...so I called him from a Pathmark.

525
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,111
There's no denying it.

526
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,447
I'm dragging a bunch
of fucking ghouls around with me.

527
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,242
And Mikey's their fucking ringleader.

528
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:08,910
Alright.

529
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,914
Paulie, think about it.

530
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,166
You whacked a lot of heavy hitters.

531
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,670
You think they'd join together
and follow that prick?

532
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,588
How can you just sit there?

533
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,841
He warned you about 3:00 too.

534
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,886
I don't believe any of this.
It doesn't mean a fucking thing to me.

535
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,474
T, I was ready to write
the whole thing off...

536
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,477
...until this psychic mentioned
Little Sonny Pagano.

537
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,522
But that? I don't know.

538
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,776
I did this guy over 30 years ago.
How the fuck did he know that?

539
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,530
Did you ask the fucking Ghostbuster
where Matt Bevilaqua is?

540
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,199
We're breaking our ass
trying to find him...

541
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,077
...and you're up there
fucking around in Nyack.

542
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,248
He deals only with the dead.

543
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,214
You eat steak?

544
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,924
The fuck you saying?

545
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,635
In India, you'd go to hell for that.

546
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,388
I'm not in India.
What do I give a fuck?

547
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,642
That's what I'm saying. None of
this shit means a goddamn thing.

548
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,251
I'm not hungry.

549
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,420
You mind if I eat in here?

550
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,821
I'm sorry for talking
to you the way I did.

551
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,157
It's okay.

552
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,494
No, it's not.

553
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,038
I was wrong.

554
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,666
I hope you know I didn't mean it.

555
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,005
I said it because all the anger
and the frustration...

556
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,135
...of the last few days
had built up inside me and exploded.

557
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,888
There's no excuse for that.

558
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,476
I gotta learn to control my emotions
around the people I love.

559
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,317
I think you're the same way.
I think...

560
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,197
...your feelings, you keep inside.

561
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,659
And you and me,
we react without thinking.

562
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,999
So I get mad at you, you know?
I see myself in you.

563
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,882
I couldn't ask for a better son, AJ.

564
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,886
And I mean that.

565
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,308
Thanks.

566
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,147
Want a piece of pizza?

567
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,119
Here.

568
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,916
Pussy's on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

569
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,684
- I been calling you all over.
- I'll be right there.

570
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,604
What's going on?

571
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,775
Nothing.

572
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,795
He's way the fuck out near Morristown.
In Hacklebarney State Park.

573
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,465
Over by that "George Washington
slept here" house?

574
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,841
Yeah.

575
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,179
Give me one.

576
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,810
You don't have to do this.
Furio and me are on it.

577
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,606
I want to do this.

578
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,650
Good.

579
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,612
Cut Furio loose. Three's a crowd.

580
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,892
Why don't you just take it easy?
We want to talk to you. That's all.

581
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,439
It wasn't me. It was Sean.
Just Sean.

582
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,985
You're shaking.

583
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,822
You're gonna fucking kill me
for something I didn't do.

584
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,832
Don't you think we could have
killed you already if we wanted to?

585
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,168
Relax.

586
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,253
We just want to talk to you.

587
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,923
It was Sean. You gotta believe me.
It was Sean. He got nuts.

588
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,802
He said we were pissed on, that we
should get in good with Richie.

589
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,056
But I told him,
"Hey, Rome wasn't built in one day."

590
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,061
Anything. I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

591
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,441
What did Richie say?

592
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,903
It had nothing to do with Richie.
He didn't ask for it.

593
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:20,782
He got mad when I told him.
Sean did it on spec.

594
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,161
All right.

595
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,996
Come here.

596
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,123
Come here. Come on.

597
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,298
Are you sure nobody else was involved?

598
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,884
Take a minute. Think it over.

599
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,053
It was Sean all the way.

600
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,186
All right.

601
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,689
You're a good kid.

602
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,151
I'm thirsty.

603
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,571
See if we got something to drink.

604
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,699
What can I get you?

605
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,575
You want a Fanta?

606
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,661
Something like that?

607
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,794
Here.

608
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,098
How is that?

609
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:32,937
You sure you want a diet drink?
You don't want something with sugar?

610
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,440
There's only diet.

611
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,942
It's good.

612
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,156
You finished?

613
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,578
Thank you, T.

614
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:54,208
That sugarless motherfucker was
the last fucking drink you'll have.

615
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,045
Mommy! Mommy!
Please, Tony. Please!

616
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,245
Twenty-three years
of donations...

617
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,915
...and this guy sees
this hanging over me?

618
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,668
You shouldn't have seen a psychic.
It's divination, the devil...

619
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,130
...and completely unsanctioned
by the Church.

620
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,802
Psychics are heretics and thieves
who practice witchcraft.

621
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,846
There's no validity
to anything he told you.

622
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:53,059
- Your problem's a spiritual matter.
- Maybe.

623
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,605
But irregardless, I should've
had immunity to all of this shit.

624
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,983
I should have been covered
by my donations.

625
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,237
When the organ needed a reed job,
who was there?

626
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,825
When the priests and altar boys needed
new whites, who picked up the tab?

627
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,495
You should've come to me first.
This wouldn't have happened.

628
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,582
But don't worry, Paul.
I'm here. I can help you.

629
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,794
It's too late.
You been slacking off on me.

630
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,130
You left me unprotected.
I'm cutting you off for good.

631
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,050
You ain't never gonna see
another dime from me.

632
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,969
A rich man and a poor man
got the same anniversary.

633
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,723
They always meet on Madison Avenue,
shopping for their wives.

634
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,059
Poor man asks,
"What'd you buy your wife?"

635
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:21,314
Rich man says, "I got her a huge
diamond ring and a brand-new Benz."

636
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,816
Poor man says,
"Why'd you get her both?"

637
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,610
Rich man says:

638
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,529
"If she don't like
the diamond ring...

639
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,074
...she can bring it back in the Benz
and still be happy."

640
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,745
Rich man says to the poor,
"What'd you get your wife?"

641
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,165
He says, "I got her a pair
of slippers and a dildo."

642
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,168
Rich man says,
"Why'd you get her both?"

643
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,672
Poor man says, "She don't like the
slippers she can go fuck herself."

644
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,929
- Can I get another Heineken?
- Sure.

645
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,475
Remember when you first
brought me here?

646
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,851
Yeah, I remember.

647
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,270
Popped my cherry that night.

648
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,067
Yeah. It seems like old times.

649
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,287
Puss...

650
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,835
...you believe in God?

651
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,423
Yeah, I do, Ton. Absolutely.

652
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,220
Works in very mysterious ways,
His wonders to perform. But no doubt:

653
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,931
He's been very good to me.

654
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,519
- Salute.
- Salute.

655
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,833
Hi.

656
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,378
Hey.

657
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,880
How you doing?

658
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,426
Fine.

659
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,137
You?

660
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,975
Good.

661
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,853
Yeah?

662
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,315
I've been thinking.

663
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,239
What?

664
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,661
I'll do it.

665
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,795
You'll do what?

666
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,131
Snip-snip.

667
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,473
I don't want you to do it, Tony.

668
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,062
No, you want me to do it.

669
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,189
And now I want to do it.

670
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,066
So...

671
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,734
...we'll do it.

672
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,076
I started thinking.

673
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,455
Meadow is leaving soon.

674
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,835
I may want to have another baby.

675
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,005
Maybe.

676
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,137
What, are you trying
to drive me fucking crazy?

677
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,430
What's behind all this?

678
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,561
Ralphie Ritaldo with his goomar,
the vasectomy, no vasectomy, now this.

679
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,940
What? Now you don't want me cut?

680
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,319
Tony.

681
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,950
All I want is you.

682
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,287
That's all I have ever wanted.

683
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,586
And I want you to be true
and to be mine.

684
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,213
I want you to not cheat.

685
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,677
- I will be true, Carm, from now...
- No, Tony, please.

686
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,847
Well, if you're not gonna
believe me, then fine.

687
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,932
But what can I do?

688
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,020
I don't know.

689
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,563
No.

690
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,691
