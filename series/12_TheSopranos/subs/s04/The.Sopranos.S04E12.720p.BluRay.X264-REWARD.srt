1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,226
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,856
...Corrado Soprano is not some
harmless old man...

3
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,442
...being persecuted
by the government...

4
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,863
...but a ruthless and calculating
mob boss...

5
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,617
...who controls a vast
criminal enterprise.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,580
Over the past few months,
you've heard from FBI agents...

7
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,836
...who have documented clandestine
meetings at his doctors' offices.

8
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,173
Tales of bid-rigging, sweetheart deals...

9
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:17,344
...secret payoffs and even murder.

10
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:23,183
No, Corrado Soprano is not
some harmless old man...

11
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:29,857
...but a killer who orders up murder
like you and I order up coffee.

12
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,662
All right, so I rewrote it.

13
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,834
"The entire point of Melville's
Billy Budd, it seems to me...

14
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,587
...is to show how mean humans
can be to each other...

15
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,630
...when living in cramped conditions."

16
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,924
Whoa, hold that thought.

17
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,431
Come on in.

18
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,524
So how is your mother's
apartment coming?

19
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,693
Artie's Uncle Zio finished the framing.

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,613
But now the Sheetrock,
it's wet on the bottom.

21
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,656
There's a leak maybe in the foundation.

22
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,493
My father is a contractor. If you want,
I can have him take a look at it.

23
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:28,415
- He is free, I think, tomorrow afternoon.
- That would be a huge relief.

24
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,045
What smells in this house?
Madonna, it's like the smell of heaven.

25
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,590
Homemade scones. My son loves them.

26
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,343
Here, try one.
They are just out of the oven.

27
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,470
Thank you, no.

28
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,265
Well, that's all there is for breakfast
is fat and carbs?

29
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,060
We have a guest.
Could you say hello?

30
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,895
Anyway...

31
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,149
"When Mr. Claggart gets mad at Billy,
it is a surprise...

32
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,736
...because he is always saying
how handsome Billy is.

33
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,823
This does not seem realistic,
because why would an officer care...

34
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,660
...if a sailor was handsome or not?"

35
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,748
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

36
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,388
A.J., your father's leaving.
I'll come up in a minute. Go over it.

37
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,061
What is this?

38
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,440
"Ocean Club at Paradise Island."

39
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,902
We leave tomorrow
for three beautiful days.

40
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,779
Tomorrow?

41
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,824
I know it's short notice,
but the deal came through.

42
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,619
It's got a view suite,
first-class plane tickets.

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,122
Guy owes me a favor.

44
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,669
- What?
- I don't know.

45
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,673
- A.J., school...
- He's old enough to spoil himself now.

46
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,175
You were so jealous
when I left for Florida...

47
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,846
And my mother's skin condition.
Just the time it'll take to pack.

48
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,725
- To pack.
- I'll wait outside.

49
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,605
With all the shit that's been
going on, the horse and all...

50
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,651
Now, I know you need a break.
Deep down...

51
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,405
...that's probably the reason
you got your hair cut.

52
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,950
You believe that in there? The tickets?

53
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,578
She's always complaining
how we never get away.

54
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,331
So I make it happen,
top-shelf across the board.

55
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,960
All of a sudden, her mother's psoriasis
is like the bubonic fucking plague.

56
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,465
You know what, va fangool.
I don't know why I bother.

57
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,843
- She's probably worried for her mother.
- Fuck that.

58
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,471
They got her on the cortisone.

59
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,892
I know she's my wife and the mother
of my children and all.

60
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,187
But let me tell you something,
she can be a moody bitch.

61
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:05,197
There he is! Live from Miami Beach!

62
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,575
Hey.

63
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,619
- Where's your pop?
- Clubhouse.

64
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,163
Forgot to put his Desenex.

65
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,340
- So? This shit with Tony?
- Total debacle.

66
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,259
And Pop with his testa dura
is not doing anybody any good.

67
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,804
Anything you can do
to change your father's mind.

68
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,933
I'm gonna try, John.
I came all the way up here for that.

69
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,062
You put your sunblock on?

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,529
You know, Dad, Tony Soprano
came to visit me recently.

71
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,322
I bought him dinner, we talked.

72
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,991
I'm not sure I like
that he did that end run.

73
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,619
He's an old-fashioned guy, Pop,
very allegorical.

74
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,705
I don't think it was his intention
to insult anybody.

75
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,877
You distracted me.
I'm taking a mulligan.

76
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,715
I'm afraid that maybe you backed
yourself into a corner, this HUD thing.

77
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,218
Your insistence on the 40 percent.

78
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,180
Remember, Carmine, from the beginning,
I thought 40 was a tad steep.

79
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,225
A real hard-head this Soprano kid.

80
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,561
And the ego!

81
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:22,065
I tell you, though, when I first met him,
decisive as he is...

82
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,402
...I would have been proud
to call him my own son.

83
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:33,910
- Maybe there's a compromise here, then.
- There's always a compromise.

84
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,874
He's a bit of a poseur, you ask me.

85
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,294
Tony, he likes to talk the talk.
I don't know.

86
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,047
- What? What'd he say?
- His turf, his appraiser.

87
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,134
- Son of a bitch.
- What, did they resod that green?

88
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,052
No, you gotta give him some slack.

89
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,431
He hasn't really been boss
of a family very long.

90
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,603
Family? I told you.
They're a glorified crew.

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,024
Whatever they are, Carmine,
the Sopranos bring in a lot of cash.

92
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,068
I've been close with Tony
for a lot of years.

93
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,446
On reflection,
maybe that's the sticking post.

94
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,073
Tony feels you're friends,
not business associates.

95
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:17,704
See? What am I always saying?
I hate this fucking shit!

96
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:31,343
Well, it's a small space, but I guess
that makes it a decorating challenge.

97
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,429
The man in the store says
to put mirrors...

98
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,475
...but Mama thinks it's nose-in-the-air
when people look at themselves.

99
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:45,232
How about, let's see,
something like this?

100
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,944
That's beautiful.
She's fall in love with that place.

101
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,865
It's so cozy with the pillows, romantic.

102
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,618
Not that your mother would be...

103
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,958
I never thank you for helping me.

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,043
That's okay.

105
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,797
You're a very special woman.

106
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,428
Have you thought about flooring yet?

107
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,266
Not really, no.

108
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,436
Speak English, for chrissakes.

109
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,438
Well, if she doesn't go for mirrors...

110
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,942
...we should pick a light-colored
ceramic tile maybe.

111
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,112
All the houses back home have
the tile floors.

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,366
Well, then we should go to Colortile,
then. They have everything.

113
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:42,539
- I would love to go with you there.
- Great, then it's a date, then.

114
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,041
Good, it's a date.

115
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,215
The handicaps are all taken.

116
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,385
What beautiful affairs,
those Knights of Columbus dinners.

117
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,222
Julius La Rosa would sing with
that voice of his. Top dollar they paid.

118
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,183
Now, that's a nice-looking man.

119
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,818
- There's a handicap by the door.
- Quick, Minn.

120
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,321
I remember him
from Arthur Godfrey's program.

121
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,489
He was so mean to him, that man.

122
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,578
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

123
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,415
I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. Oh, my God.

124
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,584
Jesus Christ, lady! Didn't you see me?

125
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,471
Guy checks into one of the rooms, calls
down, says, "I got a leak in the sink."

126
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,891
I said, "Go ahead,
the customer's always right."

127
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,102
Any results from Little Carmine yet?

128
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,314
John Sack wants a sit-down
tomorrow night.

129
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,567
Sweetheart? Another drink.

130
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,405
Well, what do you say, Ton?
Maybe we should take off soon.

131
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:02,702
- What's your hurry? Hang on a while.
- Stay, I'll get you home.

132
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,497
- No, we should go.
- All right, you two wanna go?

133
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,501
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Come on, I'll walk you out.

134
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,087
Perfect.

135
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,965
Got my drink, a little dancing.

136
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,560
Wanna go upstairs?

137
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,523
That's okay.

138
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,537
Oh, Paulie. Madonna!

139
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,832
For Pete's sake, Nucci, you were fine
for the last two hours.

140
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,793
- All right, let me see.
- She's just a little shaken up.

141
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,879
- We gave her some Tylenol.
- It was such a crash though.

142
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,048
Cookie's in the x-ray with three stitches.

143
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,592
When was the last time
you had your eyes checked?

144
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,554
- My eyesight is fine.
- Listen to the doc.

145
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,265
You shouldn't be driving at your age.

146
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,642
I've been driving
since I was a young girl.

147
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,604
- Horse and buggies don't count.
- Paulie, be nice.

148
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,315
Relax, Ma.
She ain't driving you no more.

149
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,986
Maybe if your mother wasn't talking
in my ear!

150
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,029
We were all chatting.

151
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,866
Everybody says you're moving
into the home anyway.

152
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,327
- What do you need a car for?
- I like my independence.

153
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,998
- And it's none of your business.
- This is my ma we're talking about.

154
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,418
But we have tickets to The Producers.

155
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,130
Don't worry about it.
I'll drive you girls.

156
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,676
Hello?

157
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,555
- Colin, hi.
- Hey, Mrs. Soprano.

158
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,640
Meadow's on campus.
She'll be right back.

159
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,228
- I'm Ellen McDermott, Colin's mother.
- Hi.

160
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,481
I'm gonna get my shoes.

161
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,566
You've seen the apartment before?

162
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,903
I teach school out in Akron,
and I couldn't get here till now.

163
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,239
We thought she's only a sophomore,
why does she need an apartment?

164
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,826
But with those seniors moving out
mid-term, we said a Hail Mary.

165
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:11,164
No, I have to tell you.
Your daughter is really something.

166
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,418
- His old roommate...
- Thank you. Colin is very sweet also.

167
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,297
Thank you.
But she's going places, that girl.

168
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,966
Poised, mature.
Cooks for these other two.

169
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,470
Plus she volunteers at that law center.
I think that's extraordinary.

170
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,555
Congratulations.

171
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,140
Well, speak of the devil.

172
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,393
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,396
- Mom, remember Alex?
- Of course, hi.

174
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,023
Excuse me.

175
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,609
- Hi.
- Hey.

176
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:48,576
- Well, the place is really shaping up.
- I guess.

177
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,831
What's the matter? Finn? I thought
things were going well with you two.

178
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,042
They are. I don't know, I...

179
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,754
I keep waiting for him to say
he loves me, and he hasn't.

180
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,555
Some men have to move
at their own pace, Med.

181
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,599
It's amazing, isn't it?

182
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,857
Whoa, Nelly.

183
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,153
- He'll be all right.
- So, what do you say?

184
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,322
You boys hungry?

185
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,450
- We gotta go.
- The limo's on its way up from Norwalk.

186
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,911
Marty, why don't you chopper them out?

187
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,207
Chopper? That's fucking awesome.

188
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,043
I'll call Doug, see if it's available.

189
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,011
Doug, I got Tony Soprano here.

190
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,472
He was asking if the chopper's available.

191
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,100
I know.

192
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,855
This new fucking girl told him.

193
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,566
I know.

194
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,237
About 15K between the five of them.

195
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,699
I know.

196
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,994
Righty-o.

197
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,872
Good news, gentlemen.

198
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,928
Sorry about the mess.

199
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,848
Mr. Soprano? Greg Erwitt.
You got any luggage?

200
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,394
- Just him.
- He's drunk. He's just regurge.

201
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:43,900
- So Caldwell Airport, right?
- Fuck that, how about Maui?

202
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,736
Just climb on in and buckle up.

203
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:52,992
- Oh, Jesus! Old Faithful.
- Better here than at 2000 feet.

204
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,994
I gotta take a piss.

205
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,671
Oh, yeah!

206
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,067
What the fuck you doing?

207
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,406
You're standing too close.

208
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:34,135
- Furio come by?
- He's already 40 minutes late.

209
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,514
Probably worse off than me.

210
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,517
What, did you two go out?

211
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,645
Can I get a cup of coffee?

212
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,612
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know.

213
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,449
- Was he out with somebody last night?
- He's a single guy. How should I know?

214
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,494
Anyway, my memory's a little hazy.

215
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:10,755
I'm going back to bed.
When he gets here, don't wake me.

216
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,027
I'm not home now, leave a message.

217
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,421
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

218
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,215
- Meadow, hi.
- You all right?

219
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,217
You don't sound happy
to hear from me.

220
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,720
- Of course I am. What's up?
- Nothing.

221
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,181
I wanted to invite you guys
for dinner Sunday...

222
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,684
...so Dad can see the place
and meet the crew.

223
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,895
- How nice. What brought that on?
- I figure before break.

224
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,398
Finn invited me to go skiing
in Canada next week.

225
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,483
- You want me to make anything?
- Nothing.

226
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,944
I'm doing everything myself.

227
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,529
Maybe wine.

228
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,948
We only drink good wine
when parents come.

229
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,702
- Anyway, I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

230
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

231
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,365
Hi, Sil.

232
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,661
- Nice place.
- Yeah, we open in a few weeks.

233
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,373
Carmine got the chef from Fontanella,
killer wine list.

234
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,919
Look at this. It used to hang
in Fiorello LaGuardia's office.

235
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,089
- Who's that, Carmine in that boat?
- Gin and I are going over next month.

236
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,799
Salute.

237
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,351
Listen, Tony. It's very important
to Carmine that we work something out.

238
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,646
- If it's so important, where is he?
- His son's leaving tomorrow.

239
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,356
He had family obligations.

240
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,025
All right, so, what's the offer?

241
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,070
Forty percent of the HUD take
across the board starting now.

242
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,738
Forty?

243
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,158
I thought Little Carmine said
he was gonna take care of this.

244
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,120
- He did. That's why the concession.
- We were at 40 a week ago.

245
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,998
What's done already is done.
You keep that for yourself.

246
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,669
Forty percent only applies
to future deals.

247
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,172
Let's go.

248
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,769
Carmela!

249
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,562
- Darlene, hi, how are you?
- Great.

250
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,981
I wanted to thank you.

251
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,234
Your husband's friend came
by the office. We got the listing.

252
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,903
- Which friend? Who?
- Furio Gunther?

253
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,073
Is that how you say it?
House just went on the market.

254
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,994
Hi, Penny! How are you?

255
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,988
Yeah, all right. All right.
I'll talk to you later.

256
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,533
Who was that?

257
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,328
Silvio.

258
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,413
Listen to this.

259
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,958
Furio called. The stupid fucking zip
moved back to Italy.

260
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,671
Asshole left a message on the answering
machine at the Bing at 4:30 a.m.

261
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,632
Here, carry this.

262
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,022
- Flower delivery.
- Come on in, I'll be right there.

263
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,610
- Hi, Mrs. Soprano.
- Hi, Finn.

264
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,446
Mr. Soprano, Finn Detrolio.

265
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,948
- Finn the dentist, right?
- Someday.

266
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,242
I'm still waiting to hear
from dental school.

267
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,537
Remind me to talk to you
about this loose filling later.

268
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,790
Hi.

269
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,338
These are beautiful, thank you.

270
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,388
So, what smells so good in there?

271
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,224
Mom's recipe for chicken cacciatore.

272
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,726
You see, I should have known.

273
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,020
You always leave your door open
like that?

274
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,899
- I'm cooking, it's hot.
- I'll protect her, don't worry.

275
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,112
You hear that? Anybody bothers her,
he'll knock their teeth out...

276
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,614
...then he can put them back in too.

277
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,868
These are my roommates,
Colin and Alex.

278
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,745
Hi.

279
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,581
- So you're her roommate too?
- Colin McDermott.

280
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,458
I've heard so much about you.

281
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,129
- So he lives here and you don't?
- Dad.

282
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:47,425
- I have a place on 118th Street.
- Good.

283
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,428
I'll show you around later.

284
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,437
So, Finn...

285
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,897
...where you from?
My dad was in the Navy.

286
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,276
I was born in Japan, grew up
on a base near the Azores.

287
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,486
So...

288
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,906
...your dad was a sailor?
Surgeon, actually.

289
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,785
- So you've been all over the world.
- Yeah, pretty much.

290
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,416
- Would you like a mushroom?
- No, I don't think so.

291
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,836
- Have one, they're good.
- Maybe later.

292
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,964
I gotta tell you, Mrs. Soprano.

293
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,551
Your daughter absolutely
keeps us alive with her cooking.

294
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,304
Didn't you make macaroni
and cheese once?

295
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,223
Well, I didn't want to brag.

296
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,000
Yo, guys. Come here. Look at this.

297
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,467
So, Finn, Meadow tells me
that you're going skiing.

298
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,762
For four days next week,
a whole bunch of us.

299
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,767
A friend of my dad has a house
in the Laurentians near Montreal.

300
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,228
You can ski right onto the trails.

301
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,731
I saw pictures.
There's this humongous stone fireplace.

302
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,443
Just be careful with all those
accidents you read about.

303
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,737
- Sonny Bono.
- How about you, Alex?

304
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,572
- You ski?
- I used to.

305
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,824
My family had a retreat
near the Pyrenees.

306
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,203
- Pyrenees?
- Alex is descended from Spanish royalty.

307
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,997
- Seriously?
- She's our little princess.

308
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,833
My great-great-grandmother
was a countess.

309
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,671
- Which makes you...
- Technically, I'm an infante de gracia.

310
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
But that wouldn't fit
on her driver's license.

311
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,011
Well, you might have told me
you were living with royalty.

312
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,307
Well, my daughter's an Italian princess.
Does that count?

313
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,102
My wife too, for that matter.

314
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,731
- There's more chicken if anyone wants.
- Yeah, I'll take a little more.

315
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,653
- So, A.J., what are you, a junior?
- Next year.

316
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:18,284
- Did you look at any schools yet?
- Not really. I'll go to Rutgers, I guess.

317
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,413
- Are you passing everything?
- I got a C on a paper I did on Billy Budd.

318
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,540
A C?!

319
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,458
He usually gets D's and F's.

320
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,337
- What's with you today? You okay?
- He worked so hard on it. Why only a C?

321
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,673
I don't know.

322
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,551
- Did you like Billy Budd?
- It was okay.

323
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,681
- My teacher says it's a gay book.
- Mr. Weggler? That is ridiculous.

324
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,309
I've heard that before.

325
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,269
That was written in the 19th century?

326
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,772
- I didn't know they had fags back then.
- A.J.

327
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,566
- No offense.
- I'm not gay.

328
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,277
- You're not?
- No.

329
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,240
I read where they found
gay cave-drawings in Africa.

330
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,992
Really?

331
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,785
Shut up!

332
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,289
This stuff is pervading
our educational system...

333
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,042
...not to mention movies, TV shows.

334
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,211
- What "stuff"?
- This gay nonsense they're teaching.

335
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,922
I am sorry, but Billy Budd
is not a homosexual book.

336
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,716
Actually it is, Mother.

337
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,010
I saw the movie, Meadow,
with Terence Stamp.

338
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,554
He was in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

339
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,306
I don't know about that.

340
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:27,519
But Billy Budd is the story of an innocent
sailor being picked on by an evil boss.

341
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,356
Who is picking on him out
of self-loathing caused by...

342
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,858
...homosexual feelings
in a military context.

343
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,028
- Oh, please!
- Okay.

344
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,364
Actually, Mrs. Soprano...

345
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,075
...there is a passage where
Melville compares Billy...

346
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,910
...to a nude statue of Adam.

347
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,454
- Really?
- I thought you read it.

348
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,956
It's a biblical reference,
does that make it gay?

349
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,541
What's the difference?

350
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,253
I'm saying it's ridiculous how everything
is being sold as homosexual.

351
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,257
Must be a gay book.
Billy Budd's the ship's florist, right?

352
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,472
Leslie Fiedler has written
on gay themes in literature...

353
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,308
...since the early '60s,
Billy Budd in particular.

354
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,769
Well, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

355
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,856
She's a he, Mother, and he's lectured
at Columbia, as a matter of fact.

356
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,901
Well, maybe he's gay.
You ever thought of that?

357
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,245
They broke the urn.

358
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,877
He sent Little Paulie
to trash Carmine's restaurant?

359
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,004
He works for me.

360
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:41,468
- What do I know?
- A lot more than me, that's for sure.

361
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,887
Everybody does.

362
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:51,145
We've been friends a long time, Paulie.
I'm gonna go off the record here.

363
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:57,568
You know, I probably shouldn't be
telling you this, but since you ask...

364
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,113
I think certain people are starting
to wonder where your heart is.

365
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,992
People who? Tony?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

366
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,746
Right there, your attitude lately.

367
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,915
Four months inside, I'm supposed
to skip down the street?

368
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:16,420
You're only as good as your last
envelope, you know that.

369
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,090
You have any idea what Albert
kicked up last week?

370
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,885
Fuck that fucking parakeet.

371
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,971
I got a relationship with Tony
Albert will never have.

372
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,682
No matter how far he sticks
his tongue up Tony's ass.

373
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,769
All right, fuck this.

374
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,565
Every friendship has its peaks
and valleys.

375
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,903
Right now, me and Tony
are in the valley.

376
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,239
The cycle comes around,
it'll be different.

377
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,826
I'm past worrying I gotta be
the top earner every fucking second.

378
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,912
So there you go then.

379
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,041
Don't give me that smart-alecky shit.

380
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't forget, I go back
in this family to Johnny.

381
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,047
Before you, even.

382
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,258
It's your fault anyway.

383
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,513
All this shit started with that Russian
when I had to go pick up your 5 grand.

384
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,974
You know, things might be
a little different, Paulie...

385
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,353
...if you could accept some
responsibility for a change.

386
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,105
You're a wormy cocksucker,
you know that?

387
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,818
I'm just telling you how
you're being fucking perceived!

388
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,821
Just worry about how
you're fucking perceived!

389
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,533
Nobody knows what the future holds,
my friend.

390
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,806
You heard what he did
to the restaurant?

391
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,310
So how do you want to respond?
We gotta break this guy's back.

392
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,693
I haven't wanted to do this.

393
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,070
But it's gotta be.

394
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,030
Call the union.

395
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,287
His mother was coming.
He was so excited, Ro.

396
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,206
- We had a date to go to Colortile.
- A date?

397
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,751
To look at tile
for his mother's apartment.

398
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,213
No phone call, no note.

399
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,051
- I know I sound foolish.
- No, you don't, honey.

400
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,847
When I ran into Darlene at church...

401
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,391
...I felt like somebody punched me
in the stomach.

402
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,519
I almost threw up the sacrament.

403
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,105
- What am I gonna do, Ro?
- What's there to do?

404
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,442
A couple of months
you'll forget all about him.

405
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,319
I don't know if I can.

406
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,655
You don't think Tony said
something to him, do you?

407
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,712
I didn't see what all the fuss was,
particularly for what it cost.

408
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,548
Remember we saw
Man From La Mancha that time?

409
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,218
Richard Kiley stared at Ma
the whole time he was singing...

410
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,388
..."The Impossible Dream."
How I cried.

411
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,267
- Give me Sondheim any day.
- When Salvatore was alive...

412
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,104
...Minn went to the theater every week.
He did well, Salvatore.

413
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,567
- Barber scissors, right?
- Precision cutlery, 46 years.

414
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,694
There you are, sir.

415
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,739
Finally, the doggy bags.

416
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,080
I give these to my son.

417
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,256
Here's for Ma and me.
Parking and gas, I'll take care of.

418
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,095
- I have a hundred I need to break.
- Come on, Ma.

419
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,766
- Shoot, I forgot to cash my check.
- Don't you have direct deposit?

420
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,768
She doesn't have a savings account.

421
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,104
I like to have the money
right in my hands.

422
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,024
- Still keep it under the mattress?
- Never you mind where I keep it.

423
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,318
I need change.

424
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,280
Where's my rolls?

425
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,034
- I don't know, Ma.
- Waiter.

426
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,792
These Parker House rolls,
they belong to my ma.

427
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,878
They do not.
They were for the table.

428
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,259
Wrap these up, will you? Cellophane.

429
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,098
Come on, Ma.

430
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,787
What the fuck is this now?

431
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,632
Can I have your attention, please?

432
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,303
I repeat, can I have
your attention, please?

433
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,306
- Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
- You the foreman?

434
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,018
Dave Fusco. I'm the business agent
for local 87, laborers.

435
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:27,064
This site is employing a substantial
number of non-union laborers...

436
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,567
...in violation of our master contract.
Come on, what the fuck?

437
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34,654
- Frankly, sir, I'm shocked and appalled.
- What, are you fucking kidding?

438
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,784
This site is shut down
until further notice.

439
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:52,047
- Danny! Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

440
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,301
We just want you to know how glad
we are a guy like you is on that jury.

441
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,888
That mob thing.
That Junior Soprano trial.

442
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,599
I got that.

443
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,813
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- It's a privilege.

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,566
Hard-working guy, wife and two kids.

445
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,237
Performing a civic duty
we should all take part in.

446
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,697
We know you'll do the right thing.

447
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,568
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. What are you doing?

448
00:35:55,236 --> 00:36:00,490
- Nothing, just reading. You all right?
- Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

449
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,828
- Did I do something to piss you off?
- What are you talking about?

450
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,330
You were kind of mad
at me the other night.

451
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,667
- Why would I be mad?
- I don't know.

452
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,962
Anyway, the reason I called...

453
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,425
It's kind of near my birthday,
and I was thinking we'd do our tradition.

454
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,262
Go to the plaza for tea
under Eloise's picture.

455
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,931
Really? That's so wonderful.

456
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,518
Are you crying?

457
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,062
I'm just happy. That's so thoughtful.

458
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,900
I was thinking tomorrow, it's the only
day I have before we go to Canada.

459
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:43,074
Well, I have my nails in the morning, but
I could drive in and meet you after that.

460
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,785
I'm gonna be on the West Side,
can you pick me up?

461
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,830
Sure. I'll take the George
Washington Bridge.

462
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,707
Why, if you're going to Midtown?

463
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:55,170
- I know how to get to the city, Meadow.
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

464
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,297
- How's 1:00?
- That's fine.

465
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,508
On second thought, I'll just
meet you there. I love you.

466
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,344
I love you too.

467
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,518
Well, it happened.

468
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,396
Stubborn old fuck
shut down the Esplanade.

469
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,066
This business agent he owns
was there from the union.

470
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,109
Put on an Emmy-caliber performance.

471
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,697
Let him take his 40-percent bullshit
and run it by the other four bosses.

472
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,451
If you want, we could torch a few
of his cement trucks.

473
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,458
No retaliation, counter-retaliation.

474
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,920
- We just sit tight.
- It's gonna cost us, T.

475
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:41,299
- That's why Carmine did it.
- It's gonna cost him too.

476
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:53,520
- I brought these.
- Sorry, I am not wearing the gloves.

477
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,064
Soprano family tradition
notwithstanding.

478
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,275
I didn't think so.

479
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,027
But I'm wearing mine.

480
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,615
- Where'd you park?
- There's a lot over on 57th Street.

481
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,159
Would you like to lecture me
on parking too?

482
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,869
What are you talking about?

483
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,580
Since you're an authority
on driving directions...

484
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,375
- Very funny.
- Not to mention literature.

485
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,961
So it's the Billy Budd thing.

486
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,505
I was merely pointing out to you...

487
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,758
...what serious literary critics
have to say about the book.

488
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,474
These look delicious.

489
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,315
So how is Finn?
When are you leaving for Montreal?

490
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,485
Wednesday. He's gonna pick me up
at home. I have my ski clothes there...

491
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,739
...so I'm gonna stay over
the night before and do laundry.

492
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,200
- Is that a problem?
- No, of course not.

493
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,244
As long as he stays
in the guest room.

494
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,079
He's not staying, Mother.

495
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,582
The way you two hang
on each other...

496
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,795
Well, excuse me, Mrs. Danvers.
What do you have against love?

497
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,758
- Nothing.
- Why are you not happy for me?

498
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,763
Are you jealous? Just because
you and Dad are middle-aged?

499
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,473
Watch it, young lady.

500
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,143
- What am I, a child?
- Actually, yes.

501
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,812
Your apartment in Manhattan
notwithstanding.

502
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,231
- What?
- I'm sure your friend, the princess...

503
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,817
...found us quite amusing.
You wanted me to go...

504
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,321
...to an Ivy League school. These are
the type of people who go there.

505
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,990
There are also people who grew up
without plumbing...

506
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,576
...but you would know
even less about them.

507
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,037
Would you rather I transfer
to Montclair State?

508
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,706
Then maybe I can drop out
like you did.

509
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,715
- I'm sorry.
- I invited you here for a nice time...

510
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,051
...not to belittle me.

511
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,678
Maybe you'll be happier
if I didn't come around.

512
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,724
Except that won't happen, because
you'll need money in about a week.

513
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,478
To hell with not coming around,
I'll just transfer to Northwestern...

514
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,231
...so I can be near Finn when he goes.

515
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,570
Sure, sure.

516
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,366
Carmine, hey. What are you doing here?

517
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,660
I'm a guest. My housekeeper's daughter.

518
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,289
Small world. The groom's dad
is my third cousin.

519
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,334
Beautiful ceremony, huh?

520
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,045
So listen...

521
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,299
...about all this stuff that's going on,
Tony and all.

522
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:14,053
- What's your name again?
- Paulie Gualtieri. Jersey?

523
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,474
Your father was run over
by a trolley, right?

524
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,518
Johnny talked to you about me, right?

525
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,689
Johnny who? Sack?
Talked to me about what?

526
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,291
- Anything good?
- Just bills.

527
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,926
- So you never told me about your lunch.
- It was horrible, since you ask.

528
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,804
She's threatening to transfer
to Northwestern.

529
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,975
- What brought that on?
- Boyfriend probably, Finn.

530
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,603
Maybe she wants to put some space
between us, I don't know.

531
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,857
- Why would she wanna do that?
- You know, frankly, I don't care.

532
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,152
The way I feel now, if I never
see her again, that would be fine.

533
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,073
- How could you say that?
- Look, Tony.

534
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:02,870
I don't feel well. My joints ache,
my stomach is all queasy.

535
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,041
- You asked, I told.
- Just making conversation.

536
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,296
- If you don't care, don't bring it up!
- All right, calm down.

537
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,924
I don't have enough on my plate?

538
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,803
One of my key guys disappeared
to Naples, for chrissakes!

539
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,326
- Have you seen my Nordica goggles?
- Yeah, they're in the basement.

540
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,745
I had to solder something
to my computer.

541
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,371
What are you reading?

542
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,792
Death in Venice.
Mr. Weggler assigned it.

543
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,212
Where's Mom?

544
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,506
Bed, I guess.

545
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,133
She seem weird to you lately?

546
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,385
- How?
- Angry, sad?

547
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,554
I guess she's been crying a lot.

548
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,182
- Since when?
- Last week.

549
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,309
I think she's upset about Furio's dad.

550
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,102
- Why? What do you mean?
- He died.

551
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,980
And I think Furio went back
to Italy or something.

552
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,358
- She was going over there a lot.
- To Furio's?

553
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,318
She was helping him decorate.

554
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,364
And she made me go too.
It was really a pain in the ass.

555
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:25,703
- She took you there? More than once?
- I don't know, a couple, three times.

556
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:33,336
- Oh, dude. Meeting's over.
- Oh, Jesus.

557
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,545
Who's there?

558
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,589
What are you doing?

559
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,760
Minn! Your door was open.
I brought you something from my ma.

560
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,972
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy.

561
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,766
I didn't know you were home.
Your car was gone.

562
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,227
It's being repaired.

563
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,481
- What are you doing?
- Calling your mother.

564
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,737
I know you.

565
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,367
- You got any coffee?
- My kitchen's all wiped off for the night.

566
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,328
Well, this week then, I'll bring my ma...

567
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,373
...the three of us, we'll go have lunch
over at Pals Cabin.

568
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,752
- You're here to rob me.
- No, no. What are you, crazy?

569
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,713
- Just calm down, okay?
- You're a disgrace to your mother.

570
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,091
Don't set that thing off!
You think I'm here to hurt you?

571
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,178
- You know me since I'm a kid.
- Help!

572
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,305
What are you doing?

573
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,516
Help! Help!

574
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,562
- Help!
- Oh, fuck!

575
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,859
- Help!
- Minn, wait!

576
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:25,740
- You were always a little bastard!
- Shut up with that fucking mouth!

577
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,996
Help! Help!

578
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,372
- There's the skip.
- Hey.

579
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:28,135
For you. I know things
have been slow lately.

580
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,014
- That ought to bring us up to date.
- What'd you do, rob a bank?

581
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,392
Back in business, T.

582
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,395
- What, are you going to track?
- Thinking about it.

583
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,398
Ton, Johnny Sack for you.

584
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,485
- What's that prick want?
- I don't know.

585
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,282
Let me take this.

586
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:06,382
Hello? Thought we did.

587
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,262
Yeah, all right, I'll meet you.

588
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,520
You say goodbye to your mother?

589
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,732
She went to the market
while I was in the shower.

590
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,035
She loves you, Meadow.

591
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,454
You know that, don't you?

592
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,666
- I know.
- Come here.

593
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,551
Cut her some slack, will you?

594
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,095
She's going through a rough time
right now.

595
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:57,224
- How come?
- Change of life, maybe.

596
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,144
Her kids are growing up.

597
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,190
We talked about this in counseling,
me and her.

598
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,776
- You guys went to counseling?
- Yeah.

599
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,612
It's part of the therapy
for the panic attacks and all.

600
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,614
You were in therapy?

601
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,952
- You knew that, didn't you?
- Oh, my God.

602
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,997
On some level she may feel...

603
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,208
...unfulfilled.

604
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,421
Switch on Rosie O'Donnell,
that's all these women bitch about.

605
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,759
A little of that's probably my fault,
anyway.

606
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,098
It's an epidemic, right?

607
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,187
- You really think that's it?
- Yeah.

608
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,572
It's probably the beginning
of menopause, like you said.

609
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,534
All right, you go have a good time.

610
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,536
Thanks.

611
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,783
Well, here I am. What is it?

612
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,536
We go back a long way, Tony.

613
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,372
We've come way too far
to let it all go to shit.

614
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,292
With all due respect, you wanna go
down memory lane?

615
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,252
Put it in second gear, huh?

616
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,671
The Esplanade now.

617
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,717
I wish for Carmine's own sake
he'd ease off.

618
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,471
Why don't you tell him that?

619
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,433
He's so easily upset these days,
his teeth.

620
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,728
I'll tell you, that restaurant thing
didn't help.

621
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,939
He hurt my appraiser.
What was I supposed to do?

622
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,318
It's on page four of the boss
manual, John. Jesus.

623
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,155
You're preaching to the choir, Tony.
I mean...

624
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,824
You don't wanna hear how many
of his decisions...

625
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,619
...end up lightening my pockets.

626
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,503
Why you telling me all this, John?

627
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,882
Because at heart I know you're
a pragmatist, as I am.

628
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,761
I'm telling you now.

629
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,388
Carmine won't bend.

630
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:47,103
- And I just told you, I won't.
- If Carmine's health were bad...

631
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,315
...if something were to happen
to him, God forbid...

632
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,112
...all of this unpleasantness
would just...

633
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,658
- John, Carmine's fine.
- Yes.

634
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:04,036
He's very healthy.
Thank God.

635
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,124
Call me.

636
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,843
Holy shit.

637
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:25,266
As soon as we get off this barge,
I never wanna see you again.

638
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,152
- Yes?
- Tonight?

639
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,778
No.

640
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,993
You're home early.

641
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,539
What're you watching?

642
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,376
How to Marry a Millionaire.

643
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,087
Do I have a fever?

644
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,135
Maybe. A little.

645
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,847
- You want some Advil?
- I took some.

646
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,812
I talked to Meadow this morning.

647
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,898
She left for her ski trip.

648
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,651
So?

649
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,320
She's a good kid, Carm.

650
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:23,782
- She hates my guts, Tony.
- She doesn't hate you.

651
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,702
She's gonna call you.

652
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,122
Come on, you know how that works.

653
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,166
Finn'll go.

654
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,711
She'll forget all about him
in a couple of weeks.

655
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:42,343
In a few years she'll find
somebody else, settle down.

656
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,639
Maybe she won't, who knows?

657
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,976
She can do whatever she wants.

658
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,149
She's becoming a wonderful woman,
Carm.

659
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,736
A smart, beautiful...

660
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,073
...independent woman that you created.

661
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,161
