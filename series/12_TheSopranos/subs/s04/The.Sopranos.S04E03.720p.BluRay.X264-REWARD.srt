1
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,021
Oh, Massachusetts!

2
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,531
Listen to this shit.

3
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,909
"The New Jersey Council
of Indian Affairs has announced plans...

4
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,079
...to disrupt Monday's
Columbus Day Parade in Newark.

5
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,749
Council Chairman Del Redclay,
professor of cultural anthropology...

6
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,918
Stop blowing your nose.
I wanna hear this.

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,712
...says council members
and supporters will lie down...

8
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,884
...in the path of Columbus Day marchers,
quote, 'in protest of Columbus' role...

9
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,221
...in the genocide of
America's native peoples, ' unquote.

10
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,183
To launch their protest, the Native
Americans and their sympathizers...

11
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,435
...plan to begin a deathwatch
tomorrow...

12
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,856
...over the statue of Columbus
in Christopher Columbus Park."

13
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,776
Some fucking balls, badmouthing
America, especially now.

14
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,571
I thought Columbus was the hero
of America.

15
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,407
No. See, it's these Indians
and the commie fucks.

16
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,703
They wanna paint Columbus as a
slave trader instead of an explorer.

17
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,539
You gotta admit they did
get massacred, the Indians.

18
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,375
It's not like we didn't give
them shit to make up for it.

19
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,129
Land, reservations,
and now they got the casinos.

20
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,923
What the fuck we ever get
we didn't have to work for?

21
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,759
I wouldn't mind sitting on my ass,
smoking mushrooms...

22
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,053
...and collecting government checks.

23
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,058
You know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.

24
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,394
It's anti-Italian discrimination.

25
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,815
Columbus Day is a day of Italian pride.

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,943
It's our holiday,
and they wanna take it away.

27
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,945
Fuck them.

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,072
But I never liked Columbus.

29
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,824
- Hey!
- Why?

30
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,244
In Napoli, a lot of people
are not so happy for Columbus...

31
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,787
...because he was from Genoa.

32
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,456
What's the problem with Genoa?

33
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,334
The north of Italy always have
the money and the power.

34
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,295
They punish the south
since hundreds of years.

35
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,924
Even today, they put up their nose
at us like we're peasants.

36
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,801
I hate the north.

37
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,553
Jesus, take it easy.

38
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,847
I'm gonna take action here.

39
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,988
Ro, gonna go to the church luncheon
tomorrow?

40
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,950
It's on the subject of Italian-American
women and pride.

41
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,494
- I guess because of Columbus Day.
- Who's the star?

42
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,496
A woman professor
from Montclair State.

43
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,041
- Father Phil says she's very good.
- You should come, Adriana.

44
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,834
- Me?
- Yeah, come with us.

45
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,128
In the bingo room
at St. Peter and Paul's.

46
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,339
They have a series
of luncheons every week.

47
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,634
The food is good,
and the speakers have been fantastic.

48
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,514
Furio Giunta just bought himself
a little house in Nutley.

49
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,017
- He is so gorgeous.
- I'm surprised nobody's snapped him up.

50
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,353
- I think he should lose the ponytail.
- You do?

51
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,147
- I think it looks great on him.
- That's his trademark.

52
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,401
Sandi Fortunato says it looks
like a dick coming out of his head.

53
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,988
And she pretends to be his friend.
What a two-face.

54
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,076
How much money
did you make today, slut?

55
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,078
Three hundred.

56
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,538
That's all, bitch?

57
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,581
I'm gonna put you back
on the street, ho.

58
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,542
Make you work that ass.

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,253
Put me back on the street,
baby, yeah.

60
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,047
Work that ass, you little cunt.

61
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,425
Yeah, you work it, baby.

62
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,886
Mama's little tramp.
Mama's little whore.

63
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,181
- I'm gonna pimp you out, bitch.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,644
I gotta get that.

65
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,898
Hello?

66
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,735
Oh, no, no.
Hi, Ro, how are you?

67
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,278
What?

68
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,197
I can't hear you too good.

69
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,617
It must be your cell phone.
You in the car?

70
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,037
Oh, no, no. I'm coming home.

71
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,288
Yeah.

72
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,707
No, chicken's great.

73
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,545
No. Yeah, me too.

74
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,880
Bye.

75
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,597
God, we're so naughty.

76
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,225
How can we do this
with Ro on the phone?

77
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,061
What?

78
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,898
We're so wacky.

79
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,317
No regard for nothing, huh?

80
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,195
All right.

81
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,287
- Operator.
- Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call.

82
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,581
Area code 917...

83
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:22,089
- Speak.
- Collect call from Mr. Walters.

84
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,466
Okay, I'll take it, operator.

85
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,302
- How you doing?
- You know.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,637
Thanks for the stamps.

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,098
- How you getting on?
- I feel old.

88
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,308
Hey.

89
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,476
Listen, John...

90
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,772
...I just want to say, I hope your
feelings weren't hurt too bad...

91
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,982
...and that it never got back
to the missus.

92
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,278
- What the fuck you talking about?
- You didn't hear the joke about Ginny?

93
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,031
Never mind. Let it die a death.

94
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,491
What joke?

95
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,619
John, you're better off
not hearing it.

96
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,164
- Trust me.
- Fuck that! I demand you tell me, Paulie.

97
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,168
John, you got more laborers
on the job site than we got carpenters.

98
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,878
What's the problem?

99
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,298
The problem is the carpenters
are carrying Sheetrock and materials.

100
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,718
- So we ain't getting what we expected.
- Minimally expected.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,804
Hire more laborers off the books.

102
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,514
Nobody's talking to you!

103
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,142
All right, Jesus.

104
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,066
Sixty-five, 35.

105
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,985
Salute.

106
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,697
Johnny, you explain the other thing
I wanted to talk about.

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,032
Sure. Tony,
it's come to our attention...

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,743
...you bought property
around Frelinghuysen Avenue.

109
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,580
- And turned it in a week.
- So?

110
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,541
You did it with inside knowledge
from Ron Zellman.

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,378
Come to your attention from where?

112
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,714
That property's hot because
of the Esplanade.

113
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,550
We share the Esplanade.
We share Zellman.

114
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,720
If the Soprano family's gonna benefit
from a thing...

115
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,514
...Carmine feels we should have too.

116
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,939
Okay, we'll work something out.

117
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,817
Salute.

118
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,073
I've been your doctor for 30 years,
and you still hate the thermometer.

119
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,035
Tony, Furio's here!

120
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,205
Thank you for bringing those strufoli,
I love those.

121
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,459
Here's a few long-term bonds
I find effective.

122
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,921
Wouldn't it be great if the person
you trust most was your broker?

123
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,924
- Let's look at your allocation.
- We give advice that's objective...

124
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,259
...uncomplicated
and not driven by commission.

125
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,762
Call 1-800-7-SCHWAB
to set up a consultation...

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,933
...to check the health of your portfolio.
And lay off the junk bonds.

127
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,774
- I got pictures of my new house.
- Oh, let me see!

128
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,946
Welcome back. We're here today
with our guest, Dr. Del Redclay...

129
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,074
...who's a professor of anthropology
at Rutgers University...

130
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,493
...and spokesman
for the anti-Columbus protest.

131
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,454
- Oh, my God.
- And also Mr. Phillip L. Di Notti...

132
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,997
It's lovely, Fur.

133
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,669
...president of the Coalition of Italian-
American Anti-Defamation Organizations.

134
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,087
Okay.

135
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,259
- This thing gets on my nerves.
- Don't get me started.

136
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,804
Let's start with the idea of a parade
for a genocidal colonial general.

137
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,847
A national holiday, no less.

138
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,141
Such festivities
are deeply offensive to us.

139
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,643
These are broad charges.

140
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,978
All I know is...

141
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,356
...Italian-Americans are extremely
proud of Christopher Columbus.

142
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,817
Admiral of the ocean seas
and a great Italian.

143
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,653
You know well of the
compromise position we put forth.

144
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,115
Now, if you people wanna make
it an Italian-pride parade...

145
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,825
...we have no problem with that.

146
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,119
History does say
Columbus discovered America.

147
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,330
The America that put your people
in bondage for three centuries.

148
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,791
But every culture has had
to bear the pain...

149
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,544
...in the making of what I think
we can all agree...

150
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,796
...is a startling economic miracle.

151
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,632
- We cured polio.
- I have to agree with Phil.

152
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,426
- The right to vote.
- Exactly.

153
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,929
Take my grandparents.
Two simple people from Sicily...

154
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,140
...who braved the perilous
middle passage...

155
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,853
Middle passage?
That's the term for the slave trade.

156
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:10,525
Montel, the Italian people in this country
also have suffered discrimination.

157
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,152
Earth to Phil.

158
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,864
We're talking 300 years
of slavery here.

159
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,492
Enough.

160
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,752
You okay, Tony?
You look a little moosha-moosh.

161
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,547
Uncle Jun's trial starts today.

162
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,759
First Soprano family trial
in 16 years.

163
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,886
We should go.

164
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,888
The guy's gonna be
at the other place.

165
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,974
Thank you for the cookies.

166
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,728
And congratulations on that house.

167
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,022
Oh, and I like the kitchen.

168
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,608
- Take a strufoli.
- No.

169
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,786
Be seated.

170
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,081
Next case on the calendar:

171
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,751
United States of America
v. Corrado John Soprano, et al.

172
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,087
Any applications
before I bring in the jury?

173
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,588
No, Your Honor.

174
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,800
These telephone charges
on your last bill?

175
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,469
Costs me 40 bucks every time
you pick up the phone.

176
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,137
I can't...

177
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,813
Twenty-three hundred eighty dollars
last month alone.

178
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,065
I'm going to give you
some instructions...

179
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,985
...and explain the process
by which we will try this case.

180
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,821
The first order of business...

181
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,742
Looking out at this audience
of proud, strong, beautiful women...

182
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,663
...how far we have come
in this American journey.

183
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,417
Look how we've both preserved
the tradition of our ancestors...

184
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:56,131
...and managed to become
new Italian-American women.

185
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,967
Such flair we have added
to our image.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,929
And yet America still sees us...

187
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,474
...as pizza-makers and Mama Leones.

188
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,687
Well, it is your job, ladies,
to spread the word.

189
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,982
Our grandmothers may have
been dressed in black...

190
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,152
...but we're in Moschino and Armani.

191
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,158
For those who say Italian-Americans
eat smelly cheese...

192
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,118
...and sip cold wine...

193
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:31,708
...tell them we're from the land
of aromatic asiago and supple Barolo.

194
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,338
If they say
spaghetti and meatballs...

195
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,510
...you tell them
orecchiette with broccoli raab.

196
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,639
If they say John Gotti...

197
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,976
...you tell them Rudolph Giuliani.

198
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:57,192
A Princeton study showed
that 74 percent of Americans...

199
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,238
...associated Italian-Americans
with organized crime.

200
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,908
Why would they do this?

201
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,244
Because of the way
the media depict us.

202
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,540
Again, it is our job
to make sure people know...

203
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,752
...the other side
of Italian-American culture...

204
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,881
...the educated, wage-earning,
law-abiding side.

205
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,676
Because isn't that who we truly are?

206
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,685
Thank you.

207
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,564
Thank you, Professor Murphy...

208
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,359
...or should I call you
Professor Longo-Murphy?

209
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,362
"Longo" as you don't call me
late for dinner.

210
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,907
Small point. Didn't I read
about a more recent study...

211
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,118
...at Fairleigh-Dickinson
that found the opposite was true?

212
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:55,083
That the great majority of Americans
recognize these are fictional portrayals?

213
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,921
We're still looking at the sample
selection criteria used in that study.

214
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,092
Well, thanks for an excellent talk.

215
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,264
And thank you all
for attending today.

216
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,225
Don't miss Professor Murphy's
new book:

217
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,729
Strega: The Sorceress
as Imago Figure in Italian Literature.

218
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,984
And stick around
for coffee and dessert...

219
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,237
...courtesy of Cocuzzo's Pastry Shop.

220
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,452
I'll say it.
That was totally uncalled-for.

221
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,957
- Father is forgetting who his friends are.
- It was outrageous. I'm shocked.

222
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,418
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

223
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,296
How dare he?
After all you've done for this parish.

224
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,840
What are you gonna do?

225
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,470
Well, I'm gonna cut him a new one.

226
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,480
Gab, buongiorno. Vieni qua.

227
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,858
Father, I don't know what to say
I'm so upset.

228
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,152
- Why? What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

229
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,821
Carmela is one of your
biggest supporters and friends.

230
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,824
How dare you let her suffer
humiliation and embarrassment...

231
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,534
...at the hands of an outsider?

232
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,954
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh, you know exactly what I mean.

233
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,333
Because of her husband's
high profile in the waste industry...

234
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,294
...Carmela's the one who bears
the brunt of these insults.

235
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,671
But there were many of us
who were offended.

236
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,798
I am sorry.

237
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,300
This is an open forum.

238
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,344
You did hear me bring up
that new study.

239
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,471
If that's your idea
of a good speaker...

240
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,058
...I suggest you think about
who really keeps this parish alive...

241
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,810
...year after year.

242
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,696
The sight of your cities
pain the eyes of the red man.

243
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,532
A man in your cities is numb
to the stench...

244
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,411
- Go back to your reservation!
- Mussolini was Hitler's bitch!

245
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,789
Go back!

246
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,547
In the words of Chief Seattle:

247
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,425
"For the last red man
shall have perished...

248
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,387
...and the memory of my tribe...

249
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,889
...shall have become
a myth among the white man."

250
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,893
Take your tom-toms and get out of here,
you son of a bitch of a bastard!

251
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,020
"These shores, these woods.

252
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,315
The highway will swarm
with the invisible dead of our people!

253
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,234
The white man will never be alone!"

254
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,237
This is Newark, baby,
we don't play that shit!

255
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,073
And that better not be Columbus!

256
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,826
- Take it down!
- He's going to burn...

257
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,745
...the way our ancestors did!
Go sit down, cupcake!

258
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,455
We're not taking anything down!

259
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,582
I'm gonna fucking hang you up there!

260
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,131
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

261
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,924
Break it up!

262
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,051
Hey! Hey! We will make arrests!

263
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,887
- What the fuck is this, Joey?
- They got a permit, Sil.

264
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,931
Everybody, come on, let's go!

265
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,600
- Everybody!
- I'll remember this, Joey.

266
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,397
- Get away from there!
- Hey!

267
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,233
Come on, come on. You too.

268
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,447
- Stay down!
- Let me go!

269
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,451
All right, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

270
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,830
Oh, shit.

271
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,417
Down with legislation!

272
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,301
What are you doing?
This is a peaceful demonstration here.

273
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,929
Hey! Hey! Hey!

274
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,309
Hey! Everybody, get over here!

275
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,810
Get him out of here.

276
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,614
Orecchiette and broccoli raab,
you know, the truth is that is northern.

277
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,117
Armani too. And Michelangelo.

278
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,330
What a coward that man is.
He's always been a lily-liver.

279
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,831
No, he's sweet.

280
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,918
- What'd he say?
- He's all apologetic. I let him have it.

281
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,336
You did what you could.

282
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,713
I couldn't leave here
without saying something.

283
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,216
I gotta go.
I'm getting my new crown today.

284
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,468
- Bye-bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

285
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,682
Karen, bring Bobby and the kids
over for a cookout on Saturday.

286
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,366
- Hello?
- It's me, Dad.

287
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,077
- What's up, Bobby?
- Mom tried to call you.

288
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,705
She wants you to pick up some steaks
and eggplants before you come home.

289
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,916
She can't do it?

290
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,544
I'm stuck in traffic.
Now I gotta go to the store?

291
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,838
She had to go get some crowns
or something.

292
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,091
Your mother's a real pain
in the you-know-what sometimes.

293
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,678
When she gets home,
tell her I said thanks a lot.

294
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,890
If you can't find the recipe,
I'll ask Angie.

295
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,977
No, it's around here somewhere.

296
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,397
Hello?

297
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,524
Hey, Gab.

298
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,195
What? When?

299
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,448
Oh, my God.

300
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,783
Oh, no!

301
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,744
Oh, God, that's terrible.

302
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,415
Yeah. Okay.

303
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,253
What happened?

304
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,426
Karen had an accident
on Pompton Avenue.

305
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,304
She's dead.

306
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,930
Oh, Carm.

307
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,115
I get home for dinner last night,
Gabby's sitting there devastated.

308
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,660
I just saw Karen
at ShopRite last week.

309
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,288
You talking about Karen?

310
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,540
Great kid.

311
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,252
This happened to this doctor I know.
Oriental ran right into him.

312
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,755
What's Bobby gonna do?
He adored that woman.

313
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,841
What you doing getting pinched
when this family's on trial?

314
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,302
- I'm sorry, Ton...
- And you went down there too.

315
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,137
- No.
- It was my idea.

316
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,430
What the fuck?

317
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,808
We got Little Paulie in St. Barnabas.
Plus, we lost face down there.

318
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,354
This is something that hits home.
I can't turn the other cheek on this.

319
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,565
I know, but we're running
a business here.

320
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,444
Don't you all got something to do?

321
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,001
What's with you? I count on you
to be the most level-headed guy I got.

322
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,379
My father was a Knight of Columbus.

323
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,714
I'm an Italian-American,
and I pay money...

324
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:03,010
...to the Italian Anti-Defamation
Coordination Council in Bastia.

325
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,888
- We're the victims here.
- Oh, you write a check too?

326
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,974
Ton, let's not forget.

327
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,976
It was a friend of ours,
Joe Columbo...

328
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,312
...who founded the first Italian
anti-defamation organization.

329
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,857
- You were still out of line.
- You're right.

330
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,693
A hundred percent.

331
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,613
But?

332
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,367
Well, as your consigliere...

333
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,369
...since you ask...

334
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:33,874
...I think the guys and myself too,
we need your leadership on this.

335
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,503
All right.

336
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,173
All right, good. I understand you wanna
do something, but use your brain.

337
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,885
Believe me, me and Ralphie
are working on a few things.

338
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,723
This battle's gonna be won
on the P.R. level.

339
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,225
Hearts and minds.

340
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,562
They manipulate your image,
Columbus...

341
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,273
...you manipulate theirs.

342
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,358
All right.

343
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,709
- Who's calling, please?
- Good morning, assemblyman.

344
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,169
Hey, what's up?

345
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,921
Know this protest with
the Indians and Columbus Day?

346
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,465
Yeah, I heard about it.

347
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,592
We need somebody to make it go away.

348
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,888
Oh, boy, that's a tough one,
real hot potato.

349
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,222
Nobody wants to touch it.

350
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,100
We just want a peaceful parade
like we've had for years...

351
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,978
...with no interference.
What's wrong with that?

352
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,231
It's the First Amendment
and it's Native Americans.

353
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,567
Very sensitive stuff.

354
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,652
My hands are tied on this one.

355
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,571
- Sorry.
- Yeah, fine.

356
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,615
I will be attending the parade
as always.

357
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,950
You got my support there.

358
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,285
Wish that I could...

359
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,418
The last time that you dated a friend
and colleague of your brother's...

360
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,464
...he left you flat, disappeared into
the witness protection program.

361
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,924
- I know.
- Now...

362
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,343
...another man who works
with your brother...

363
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,680
...unable to meet your basic needs
for love and respect...

364
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,474
...involved with another woman.

365
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,811
Which brings me back
to my childhood...

366
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,146
...and my mother...

367
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,649
...and my father.
Now we're talking.

368
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,611
Where I had no love
and no support.

369
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,490
And where I was shamed
and ridiculed for being artistic.

370
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,118
In your relationship
with these men...

371
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,037
...you have replaced your father
with your brother...

372
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,166
...as a figure of authority
that you need to prove something to.

373
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,835
You set up these scenarios...

374
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,963
...with these men similar
to your father and your brother...

375
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:49,635
...seeking your brother,
i.e. your father's, acceptance.

376
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,887
- The hell with them.
- I know.

377
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,390
The work is to make new choices...

378
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,226
...that have nothing to do
with old patterns.

379
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,896
I want to, Sandy. I do.

380
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,524
God, give me the strength.

381
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,192
She will.

382
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,032
Your Star-Ledger interview conflicts
with Eye On New Jersey.

383
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,583
Del Redclay, right?
I knew it.

384
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,085
Yeah, I saw you on channel 21...
No, don't get up.

385
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,422
I'm Henry Caruso,
pleased to meet you.

386
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,886
- Now, this lovely lady.
- Maggie Donner, I'm Del's TA.

387
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,930
Yes. Yes, I can see that.

388
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,729
Well, I might as well get
to the point.

389
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,694
I represent a group
of concerned citizens who are...

390
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,740
...very upset about this protest
you're spearheading.

391
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,116
No puns intended.

392
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,037
- Who do you represent?
- Italians...

393
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,039
...here in New Jersey.

394
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,208
Good people.

395
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,585
Family people.

396
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,589
And they've asked me to tell you
that it's not in your best interest...

397
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,382
...to go through with this thing.

398
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,220
If you've come here to intimidate me,
you don't know about Indian resolve.

399
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,931
Del, should I call security?

400
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,267
You remember this guy?

401
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,269
Iron Eyes Cody, he was an actor.

402
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,065
Son of Paleface, Sitting Bull.

403
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,238
Your fucking poster boy.

404
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,658
Part Cherokee, part Cree.

405
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,244
He wasn't even a fucking Indian.

406
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:42,498
Second-generation Sicilian
from Louisiana named Espera DeCorti.

407
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,126
- Well, I think you better leave now.
- The guy's a total fucking phony.

408
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,337
A total fugazy.

409
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,965
Even Jay Silverheels knew it.

410
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,133
But he kept it quiet.

411
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,803
Well, we're not gonna.

412
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,305
You keep up your bullshit...

413
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,892
...we're gonna go wide with this thing.
Knock yourself out.

414
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,985
Jesus Christ, is this true?

415
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,612
This is a fucking disaster!

416
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,615
Chill out.
You didn't know about this?

417
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,494
- It's been on Access Hollywood, E!...
- This is a major P.R. boner.

418
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,832
It's been researched. Cody was definitely
Native American, total environmentalist.

419
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,336
- Are you sure about this?
- Look, Del, I'm one-eighth Italian myself.

420
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,630
You are? You never told me that.

421
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,217
My great-great something-or-other
was a pony soldier.

422
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,722
Well, actually, he was a violinist
attached to 7th Cavalry.

423
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,853
That is just one person's opinion,
Anthony.

424
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,229
What, football again?

425
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,024
He's not gonna get hurt,
he's a tough kid.

426
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,233
Jesus.

427
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,902
We're having a discussion
about Christopher Columbus.

428
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,654
"They would make fine servants.

429
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,867
With 50 men, we could subgate them."

430
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,036
Subjugate.

431
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,581
"And make them do whatever we want."

432
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,168
- That doesn't sound like a slave trader?
- George Washington had slaves.

433
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,879
- The father of our country.
- Well, what's your point?

434
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,549
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,
is teaching your son...

435
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,552
...that if Columbus was alive today,
he would go on trial...

436
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,556
...for crimes against humanity,
like Milo?evic in, you know, Europe.

437
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,769
- Your teacher said that?
- It's not just my teacher, it's the truth.

438
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,063
It's in my history book.

439
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,193
- You finally read a book and it's bullshit.
- Tony.

440
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,073
You have to walk in Columbus' shoes
to see what he went through.

441
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,909
People thought the world was flat,
for crying out loud.

442
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,080
Then he lands on an island with savages
on it. That took a lot of guts.

443
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,541
You remember when we went to Florida?
The heat? And those bugs?

444
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,002
Like it took guts to murder people.

445
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,089
- He was a victim of his time.
- Who cares? It's what he did.

446
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,634
He discovered America, is what he did.
He was a brave Italian explorer.

447
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:03,222
And in this house Christopher Columbus
is a hero. End of story.

448
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,790
I should've known.

449
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,836
I should've known you needed me.

450
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,588
I should've been with you.

451
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,092
I should've been in your place.

452
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,095
My love.

453
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,055
My sweet love.

454
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,189
Are you okay?

455
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,952
How he loved her.

456
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,334
It's cross-town, 68th Street.

457
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,673
You know what I heard one time?

458
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,676
Sil was on the phone.
He was talking with somebody...

459
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,388
...about how Bobby was the only one
of them who doesn't have a goomar.

460
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,848
They were laughing at him.

461
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,394
- Who was he talking to on the phone?
- I don't know.

462
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,984
I'll go first this time. I'll bring
my eggplant parma over to Bobby's.

463
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,404
Actually, tomorrow is better for me.

464
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,496
Ginny, hi. We were just talking
about who's gonna do what when.

465
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,999
I played canasta
with her just last week.

466
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,883
There he is. John, look...

467
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,429
...I'm sorry I missed Allegra's
nursing school graduation. Unforgivable.

468
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,848
But I made it up to her.

469
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,645
Stick it in your ass.

470
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,233
- Hey, Count Chocula...
- What the fuck, John?

471
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,110
Keep him away from me.

472
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,572
- John, what's going on?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

473
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,742
What's this?

474
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,912
I have no fucking idea.

475
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,083
But I got better shit to do.

476
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,384
You saw how it was with them
at dinner the other night.

477
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,303
Something's going on.

478
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:54,393
Plus, out of nowhere, Carmine's up my
ass on the Frelinghuysen Avenue bullshit.

479
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,436
Somebody's talking too much.

480
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,106
And it's costing me money.

481
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,734
Come on.

482
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,280
There's no release.

483
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,784
I'm surrounded by death.
My husband, my son, my friend.

484
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,289
- I don't know what to tell you, Ro.
- There's pieces torn out of me.

485
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,291
Chunks of me that are dead.

486
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,460
And look at me.
My youth, my looks, they're gone.

487
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,087
No.

488
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,424
That's from not taking care
of yourself.

489
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,636
- Dwelling on all this stuff.
- It's not stuff.

490
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,974
Do you have any idea
what it feels like?

491
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,350
Do you?

492
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,146
It's not stuff. It's death, it's pain.

493
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:48,155
I'm having a lot of trouble
dealing with this.

494
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,657
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

495
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,287
I don't think I can do this.

496
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,041
I don't think I can help you.

497
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,130
You need a lot right now and
I don't think there's anything I can do.

498
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:09,134
You can be there for me,
you can comfort me.

499
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,512
What about me?

500
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,183
- What do I get out of it?
- There it is. Right there.

501
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,185
What do you get?

502
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:23,023
How about your every need taken
care of. Sexually, everything.

503
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,276
All your shit!
It's all about you, isn't it?

504
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,571
It's not all about me, but I mean...

505
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,866
...let's be realistic.
Let's be realistic?

506
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,661
What? You wanna leave me?

507
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,500
Yeah.

508
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,710
Then get the fuck out.

509
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,006
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- How should it be?

510
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,884
How the fuck should it be?

511
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,189
Somehow Carmine found out
we were flipping properties...

512
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,858
...so your take's a little less
than we talked about.

513
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,861
He makes an issue out of Zellman?

514
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,573
- What's this one called, Hesh?
- This is Pie-O-My.

515
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,576
Just broke her maiden at Belmont
last month. A lot of speed.

516
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,078
- I'm buying her.
- Cool, man.

517
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,915
- She's beautiful, huh?
- That's right.

518
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,963
Don't you know somebody over there
at Deerpark Casino in Connecticut...

519
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,466
...run by the Mohonk tribe?
Yeah, Marty, my niece's husband.

520
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,469
This Columbus Day protest,
we need to make it go away.

521
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,722
What's wrong with freedom of speech?

522
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,808
You should hear my kid.
He calls Columbus a murderer.

523
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,602
- They wiped out my people.
- Cubans are from Spain.

524
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,773
Strictly speaking, they were Taino
Indians who got raped by Columbus.

525
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,400
That's right, Reuben.

526
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,485
Melanzane got Martin Luther King Day.

527
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,071
- I have sympathy for the red man.
- Why is that?

528
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,616
Jews, because of their history,
have common cause with the oppressed.

529
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,995
Some Indians were deliberately
given blankets tainted with smallpox.

530
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,246
Died like flies.

531
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,123
- No shit?
- Yeah, shit.

532
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,668
Yeah? You wanna talk
bioterrorism? Look who started it.

533
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,296
- Amen to that, my friend.
- That's right.

534
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,299
Christopher Columbus was
no better than Adolf Hitler.

535
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,926
Back up. Hitler?

536
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,012
Yeah. I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

537
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,807
Yeah, that Indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness...

538
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,477
...they had him on TV
and he called Columbus Hitler.

539
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,354
- Because it's true, man.
- You're talking out of your ass.

540
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,775
Columbus and Hitler?
You're trivializing the Holocaust.

541
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,153
Frankly, Reuben, if you got that kind
of covert anti-Semitism...

542
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,988
...I'd like you to leave my house.

543
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,115
- Anti-Semitism?
- That's right.

544
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,950
Fuck you too, my man!

545
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,537
Guys, come on. Reuben, Hesh,
you guys have been friends for years.

546
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,300
I'll call Marty up in Connecticut.
He knows a big Mohonk.

547
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,178
That cocksucker.

548
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,557
We're not tired.
I didn't spill food because I'm tired.

549
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't argue, okay? Listen
to your Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary.

550
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,938
Do what they say.

551
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,947
- Say good night to your Aunt Carmela.
- Good night, Aunt Carmela.

552
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,243
- It's great your family could come.
- They're leaving tomorrow.

553
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,455
- Somebody's sick up there.
- Dad? Dad?

554
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,715
Dad, Sophia locked the door.

555
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,925
Should I get that?

556
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,719
He takes all my pencils.

557
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,688
- Baccalieri residence.
- Carmela, is that you?

558
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,690
- It's Corrado.
- Oh, hello.

559
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,277
How's my boy Bobby doing? He
knows I couldn't make it to the services.

560
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,905
- All right. He's upstairs with the kids.
- What a heartbreak, huh?

561
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,076
You know, I remember the first time
I met her like it was yesterday.

562
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,705
It was my birthday dinner
at Roman Gardens. I'll never forget it.

563
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,291
She said I looked like Pablo Picasso.

564
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,918
And I didn't even know
what Picasso looked like.

565
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,589
One day she showed me a picture
of him, and you know, she was right.

566
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,632
That's very touching.
Let me get Bobby.

567
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,094
I just wanna know if he's gonna pick
me up for court tomorrow.

568
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,764
Maybe you should let Bobby be. Think
about his needs instead of your own.

569
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,267
It's not me.
Please, don't villainize me here.

570
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:32,314
Murf goes to bed early, so I wanted to
call him now if I need him to drive me.

571
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,943
I don't wanna disturb him when he's
asleep. He's an old man, for God's sakes.

572
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,795
Stella!

573
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,673
What the fuck are you doing?

574
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,510
We don't have to hide, baby.

575
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,596
I did it!

576
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,139
I told Ro.

577
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,476
- Told her about us?
- No. No, no, no.

578
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,147
I told her I didn't wanna be
with her anymore, and I left!

579
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,205
Now I can devote myself
to you completely.

580
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,667
Now there can be no more fear...

581
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,336
...no more guilt.

582
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,632
- Just sex.
- Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,387
- You know what I want.
- Yeah, you want it all, don't you?

584
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,518
Oh, yeah. You need me, slut.

585
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,187
I need it all, baby.

586
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh, shit!

587
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,986
Oh, shit, tonight's my night. I gotta
bring food over to Bobby Bacala's.

588
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,031
You're on ziti patrol too?
Ro's got Thursdays.

589
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,492
Well, what should I do?

590
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,129
You could do me a solid, Tony.

591
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,756
Next time you see Hesh, remind him...

592
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:26,553
...my granddaughter's bat mitzvah
present doesn't really work.

593
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,640
The bubble jet printer.
I don't like to keep hocking him.

594
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,642
He knows about it.

595
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,561
He said he lost the sales slip.

596
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,856
So, Marty, where is this guy?

597
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,568
There he is. What'd I say?
Right on cue.

598
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,863
Chief!

599
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,073
- Where, behind the preppy guy?
- That's him.

600
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,248
Chief, I'd like to introduce you to my
friends, Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano.

601
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,751
The guy I was telling you about.

602
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,252
Chief Doug Smith.

603
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,923
Tribal chairman of the Mohonk Indians
and CEO of Mohonk Enterprises.

604
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,885
- An honor.
- Thanks for coming all the way here.

605
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,387
I had business in Manhattan anyway.

606
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,097
Not again.

607
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,476
Would you bring the gentleman
a Ketel One up, please?

608
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,607
So, chief, he told you about the shit
going down in Newark?

609
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,151
Small element, ruins it for the rest of us.

610
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,489
I've got a quarter-billion-dollar casino
and a huge Italian-American customer base.

611
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,616
Providence, East Boston.
Good people.

612
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,577
Our part of the world.
We're closer than Atlantic City.

613
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,789
This is a brand-new facility,
state of the art.

614
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,209
This fucking protest, they're burning
Columbus in effigy down there.

615
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,837
- They're gonna lay down in the parade.
- That's not gonna happen.

616
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,508
People like Redclay, they're out of touch.
They're in their ivory towers.

617
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,637
They don't understand the economic
opportunity that funds the community.

618
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,473
You should see the Olympic-size
swimming pool...

619
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:57,310
...this man put in the Deerpark
Reservation Rec Center.

620
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,854
Well, we all got kids.

621
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,441
We don't want to see
our heritage attacked, that's all.

622
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,986
Salute.

623
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,618
Well, no offense, chief, but
you don't look much like an Indian.

624
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,371
Frankly, I passed most
of my life as white...

625
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,457
...until I had an awakening
and discovered my Mohonk blood.

626
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,211
My grandmother on my father's side,
her mother was a quarter Mohonk.

627
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,964
This happened when the casino bill
got passed, right?

628
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,134
- Better late than never.
- "Mohonk" if you love Columbus.

629
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,850
Sorry I didn't make it last night.

630
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,519
My Bible group had a potluck
for the homeless...

631
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,689
...and I was on clean-up crew, so...

632
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,525
Food, food, like that solves
all the world's problems.

633
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,193
Bobby, we've been neighbors.

634
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:52,699
I know that we don't talk much,
but if you want to, I'm here for you.

635
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,798
What is it?

636
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,721
That day...

637
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,558
...when she had the accident...

638
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,603
...I was stuck in traffic.

639
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,399
My son called because Karen wanted me
to pick up steaks and eggplants.

640
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,194
And I was mad at her for sending me.

641
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,571
I was tired.

642
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,241
I was mad at her.

643
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,412
But I was stuck in traffic
because of her accident.

644
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,083
She was up the road ahead of me
lying in twisted metal.

645
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,212
But I didn't know,
and I could've been with her.

646
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,215
I should've been there to help her.

647
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,927
But I was mad at her.

648
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,765
Oh, my sweet Karen.

649
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,768
My sweet girl.

650
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,944
Pass me the peppers.

651
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,618
Hello?

652
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,288
Oh, yeah, just a second.

653
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,667
Ton, it's the Indian chief.

654
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,680
- Doug, how are you?
- Tony, I wish I had better news.

655
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,974
I struck out.
Redclay didn't go for it.

656
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,269
Ask about the Iron Eyes Cody thing.

657
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,438
Pretended he didn't know me.
You believe the son of a bitch?

658
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,857
Ask him about Cody.

659
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,652
- You ask about Iron Eyes Cody?
- He didn't give a shit.

660
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,362
It was some Internet rumor.

661
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,781
Most Native Americans,
they don't give a fuck.

662
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,992
It's like knowing James Caan
isn't Italian.

663
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,204
All right, well, it was nice meeting you,
and I appreciate the effort.

664
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,291
You gotta let me make it up to you.
Come on up, spend a day.

665
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,794
Sil, whoever you want.
High-rollers room, everything comped.

666
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,172
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Great.

667
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,801
What the fuck did he say
about Iron Eyes Cody?

668
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,344
Ralphie had it all fucked up.

669
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,222
It don't mean nothing anyway,
because it's like knowing...

670
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,017
...James Caan isn't Italian.

671
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,236
We think this guy Redclay's
fucking a graduate student.

672
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,531
- We hire a detective...
- I think it's over, Sil.

673
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,701
- Yeah, but all we gotta...
- It's over.

674
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,875
He had just lost his wife.

675
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,045
And he had so much sadness, you know?

676
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:57,425
So much love for her,
such complete and pure emotion.

677
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,219
I felt unworthy to even be
in his presence.

678
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,098
I was so moved by him.

679
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,727
And then I look at Ralphie.

680
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,857
You saw in this man the things
that you want in your life.

681
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,568
Truth.

682
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,404
- Love.
- Yes.

683
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,573
Somehow I have to find a way...

684
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,035
...to move away from the darkness
and toward the light.

685
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,536
What does this man do?

686
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,873
He works with my brother,
but he's not like the others.

687
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,918
Sandy, he's different, believe me.

688
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,295
Okay.

689
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,715
But back to Ralph.

690
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,428
You've got to sit him down
and level with him.

691
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,389
Speak the truth, Jan.

692
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:51,062
But with the compassion and respect that
you're famous for. And say goodbye.

693
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,606
For his sake as well as yours.

694
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,402
You're right.

695
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,279
It's not his fault.

696
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,622
Roll me some numbers,
fearless leader!

697
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,792
- Coming at you.
- Yeah, six!

698
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,129
- It's all right.
- You had a great run, T.

699
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,965
You held the dice for quite a while.

700
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,928
Look at this operation.

701
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,974
Whenever I'm in these places I remember
my grandmother was part Fugahwe.

702
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,351
Maybe I should do something about it.

703
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,604
- Bullshit.
- No, no, it's true.

704
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,315
They were a nomadic tribe,
and they wander around...

705
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,110
...they get lost and they go,
"Where the Fugahwe?"

706
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,532
I see you gentlemen are having a good
time. You getting enough to eat?

707
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,992
Yeah.

708
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,827
Running out of my comps here.

709
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,163
Go find Marty,
he's on the floor somewhere.

710
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,207
Tony, can we talk a minute?
Buy you a drink?

711
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,376
Yeah, sure.

712
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,840
I wanted to give you a check
for Jason's tuition.

713
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,675
Okay.

714
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,970
- The statement's up in my bedroom.
- Oh, that's okay, I trust you.

715
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:10,349
Oh, wait, is it 5:00?

716
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,021
I'm here at Christopher
Columbus Park in Newark...

717
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,857
...where this afternoon
violence broke out briefly...

718
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,860
...between Native American
demonstrators and members...

719
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:26,699
...of a coalition of 18 various
Italian-American pride organizations.

720
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,036
Get out of here! This is our day!
You hear that?

721
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,623
He fed our people to his dogs!

722
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,127
My God, this is tragic.

723
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,759
Could be scored
with Albinoni's "Adagio."

724
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,376
Janootski!

725
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,798
Janice!

726
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,467
This is it, hon.

727
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,470
This is the last of the stuff
I had at Ro's.

728
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,597
Finito.

729
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,766
Your shoes.

730
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,226
What?

731
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,980
Didn't I ask you to take your shoes off
when you came in this house?

732
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,984
Forgot.

733
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,069
- Sorry, hon.
- You forgot.

734
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,197
So that's just it?
You fucking forgot!

735
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,581
Oh, fuck.

736
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,292
Get out! Get out!

737
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,464
My back, my back.

738
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,092
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

739
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,594
I'll kill you, you bitch.

740
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,805
- You crazy cunt!
- Get out!

741
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,165
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

742
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,542
Scuffle at the Columbus Day parade
in Newark.

743
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,630
Among those arrested was Native
American activist Del Redclay...

744
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,174
...who called the protest
an unqualified success.

745
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,177
Elsewhere, a blind river-rafter
is going to get her wish...

746
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,804
...after suing for a place
in the Colorado River...

747
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,473
I should've been there.

748
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,063
I would've been fucking there.
I forgot this was a Monday.

749
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,863
- Maybe we ought to whack this prick.
- Who the fuck are you kidding?

750
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,533
- All you thought about was blackjack.
- What?

751
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,536
You think this day in the country
was free, don't you?

752
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,538
Well, it wasn't.

753
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,875
Chief Smith wants Frankie Valli
to come up there and play a week.

754
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,711
That's what this whole fucking junket
was about.

755
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,922
- Frankie?
- Yeah, that's right.

756
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,299
That's why he buttonholed me,
goddamn it.

757
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,720
Bad blood with Frankie's manager.
So the chief wants me to call him...

758
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,056
...as payback for him reaching
out to Redclay.

759
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,226
- You're gonna make the fucking call.
- I ain't seen Frankie for...

760
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,812
Tough shit!
You're making the fucking call!

761
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,399
You and this fucking parade already!

762
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,409
I don't know what you're so hot about.

763
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,454
They discriminate against Italians as
a group when they disallow Columbus...

764
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,373
Will you fucking stop?

765
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,584
Group. Group.

766
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,132
Whatever the fuck happened to Gary
Cooper? That's what I'd like to know.

767
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,427
He died.

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,888
You mean because he fought
the Sioux in those Westerns?

769
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,765
No, fuck that.

770
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,936
Gary Cooper.
Now there was an American.

771
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,314
The strong, silent type.
He did what he had to do.

772
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:31,902
He faced the Miller Gang when none
of those other assholes would help him.

773
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,612
Now, did he complain? Did he say:

774
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,408
"I come from this poor, Texas-Irish,
illiterate fucking background...

775
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,494
...so leave me out of it
because my people got fucked over"?

776
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,791
T, not for nothing,
but you're getting a little confused here.

777
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,793
A, that was the movies.

778
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,503
What difference does that make?

779
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,798
Columbus was so long ago, he might
as well have been a movie!

780
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,634
Images, you said.

781
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,637
The point is, Gary Cooper...

782
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,140
The real Gary Cooper...

783
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,102
...or anybody named Cooper,
never suffered like the Italians.

784
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,190
The meddigan like him,
they fucked everybody else.

785
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,151
The Italians, the Polacks,
the blacks.

786
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,945
All right, if he was a meddigan
around nowadays...

787
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,448
...he'd be a member
of some victims group.

788
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,202
The fundamentalist Christians,
the abused cowboys, the gays!

789
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,331
- He was gay, Gary Cooper?
- No! Are you listening to me?

790
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,501
Hey. People suffered.

791
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,921
Did you? Except for maybe the Feds?

792
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,300
My grandparents got spit on
because they were from Calabria.

793
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,221
Let me ask you a question.
All the good things you got in your life...

794
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,723
...did they come to you
because you're Calabrese?

795
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,936
I'll tell you the answer.
The answer is no.

796
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,855
You got a smart kid
at Lackawanna College.

797
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,026
You got a wife who's a piece of ass,
at least she was when you married her.

798
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,530
You own one of the most profitable
topless bars in North Jersey.

799
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,740
Did you get all this
because you're Italian?

800
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,952
No, you got it because you're you.
Because you're smart.

801
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,873
Where the fuck is our self-esteem?
I mean...

802
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,042
That shit doesn't come from Columbus...

803
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,879
...or The Godfather
or Chef-fucking-Boyardee.

804
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,175
We gotta tiptoe around
the Indians though, don't we?

805
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,595
We can't call our teams the Braves
or the Tomahawks or the...

806
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,890
You take it up with Frankie Valli
when you talk to him.
