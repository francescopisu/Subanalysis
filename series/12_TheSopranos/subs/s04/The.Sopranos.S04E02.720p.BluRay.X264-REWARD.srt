1
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,819
Who's a big boy, huh?
Who's a big boy?

2
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,498
Lilac Personal Shopping.

3
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,083
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

4
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,294
My cousin came through
on those day-spa certificates.

5
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,548
Excellent. How's outside
Daffy's at 11?

6
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,383
Perfect.

7
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,598
You want some lunch?
I was gonna sit down to a tuna san.

8
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:26,645
- Onions? In the morning?
- Actually, it's 2:00.

9
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,275
I'm going out by the pool.

10
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,112
What, Mom?

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,823
You were gonna get up at 8:30
to be at TCBY Yogurt...

12
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,908
...when the manager got there.

13
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,162
Five days till school starts.
What's the use of getting a job?

14
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,873
Oh, I don't know.
A few textbooks you could buy.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,126
Pairs of socks. And anything that
we don't have to supply.

16
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,004
This whole thing about working
between now and class...

17
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,757
...is about you being pissed
because I didn't intern at the playhouse.

18
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,469
We bought you a car so you could
drive back and forth to your internship.

19
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,930
You don't feel bad you didn't
live up to your end?

20
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,141
We've been through this
how many times?

21
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,519
There was no stagecraft whatsoever
in what they had me doing.

22
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,272
Xeroxing does not count
towards a drama internship.

23
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,858
Did you call the drama department,
check that out?

24
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,861
No, I didn't, so can we shitcan
the courtroom theatrics?

25
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,279
Watch your mouth.

26
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,531
Like I haven't been through
enough this year.

27
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,492
Twelve credits each semester.
I'm not entitled to a summer?

28
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,702
You hardly...

29
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,331
Hello?

30
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,375
Are you kidding?

31
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,503
Listen, can I call you back?

32
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,384
You hardly broke a C, Meadow,
your entire second semester.

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,845
Maybe you forgot
my ex-boyfriend died?

34
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,806
Your grades started going down
while you were with Jackie.

35
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,892
Great.

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,144
Jesus, did you ever lose
a friend at my age?

37
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,438
Did you ever have to grieve
when you were 19?

38
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,816
Meadow, honey, you should have
been working this summer.

39
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,903
If only to feel good about yourself.
Get your mind off Jackie...

40
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,531
...instead of laying out by that pool.
I read, Mom, out by that pool.

41
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,453
- Probably half the canon.
- "The canon." Okay, what is that now?

42
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,373
Now?

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,709
The great books?
Western literature?

44
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,336
Dead white males?

45
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,923
Who even in their reductionism
have quite interesting things to say...

46
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,383
...about death and loss.

47
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,802
More interesting than
what you have to say.

48
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,887
Is Mary Higgins Clark
part of that group?

49
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,807
Because that's what I saw you reading
every time I passed by the pool.

50
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,771
Hello? Oh, hi.
You're not surprised, are you?

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,357
Come on, he's so totally duplicitous.

52
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,069
He had the nerve
to come to the pub crawl?

53
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,739
Can I call you back?

54
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,825
Are we through talking?

55
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,411
- Did you at least register for classes?
- I will.

56
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,246
Oh, just go.

57
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,582
Hi.

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,252
There's some guy
in your driveway with a ponytail?

59
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,213
What is his story?

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,050
- Hi, Mrs. Sop.
- Hello, Misty.

61
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,565
Fur, hi. He'll be down in a second.
He's just changing.

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,693
He was working outside this morning.

63
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,905
- So you want some coffee?
- Sure.

64
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,286
- I'm gonna buy a house, you know.
- No, I didn't. Where?

65
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,788
- Nutley.
- So you're gonna stay, huh?

66
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,751
- You gonna become a citizen too?
- No, you don't need that.

67
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,838
- How's it going, Ton?
- Oh, here at Peaceful Acres? Just swell.

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,590
You don't got time for coffee.

69
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,134
I need you to drop me off
so I can pick up my car.

70
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,429
Then I got an appointment.
I'll drive myself. All right?

71
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,097
Later.

72
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,851
- Say goodbye to Med for me.
- Why don't you say goodbye yourself.

73
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,610
I'll tell you what a gold mine is,
those Harry Potter books.

74
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,113
That's because it gives the other kids,
the 98-pound weaklings, hope.

75
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,574
Oh, speaking of 98 pounds?

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,411
I hear Ginny Sack's getting a 95-pound
mole taken off her ass.

77
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,165
Hey, some guy's wife. Come on.

78
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,836
All right, gentlemen, I gotta go.

79
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,673
- Talk to Patsy.
- Happy birthday.

80
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,425
All right, come on.

81
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,636
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ton.

82
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,679
Happy birthday, Al.

83
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,771
So, Pasqualin', I understand
we have some business to discuss.

84
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,857
The floor is yours.

85
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,235
Go on, tell him.

86
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,947
I drove out to Youngstown
to see Uncle Paulie...

87
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,741
...and he was, I don't know...

88
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,912
...hoping you could settle this shit with
Ralph and the no-show carpenter jobs.

89
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,206
Ralph?

90
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:01,420
Okay, for the record,
I had my guy go over the books.

91
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,715
We can do maybe two carpenter jobs:
one no-show, one no-work.

92
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,678
Two jobs? On a $300 million project?

93
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,930
Come on, Ralph.

94
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,599
What's the real number?

95
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,104
What am I, speaking in tongues here?
Two. Maybe I can do three.

96
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:23,316
- My uncle's looking for at least 10.
- I'm talking here.

97
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,861
The guy's in the can.

98
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,572
You think you wanna keep him
happy maybe?

99
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,117
All right. Here it is.

100
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,952
And this comes from...

101
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,706
For the duration...

102
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,292
...you will give Paulie
five carpenter jobs:

103
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,504
Two no-shows and three no-works.

104
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,966
One of the no-shows
our friend in Youngstown keeps...

105
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,719
...and one he gives to Chrissy here.

106
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,722
The others, the no-work jobs,
that's for Paulie.

107
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,932
How he wants to distribute them.

108
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,645
It is so decreed.
Now, if there isn't anything else?

109
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,607
There is something else.

110
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:08,195
With Paulie in the can,
there's a new acting capo of his crew.

111
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,075
- It's Chrissy.
- Hey, Chrissy, good job.

112
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,289
That's the way certain people want it,
and we trust there will be no ill will.

113
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,878
This is fucking great. I mean,
I know I'm just the acting, but still...

114
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,049
- It's a big responsibility, Chrissy.
- Hey, I got it covered.

115
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,719
First thing I'm doing
is getting wings in my hair.

116
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,431
You know, like Paulie.

117
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,476
I'll talk to you later.

118
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,366
See these crystal paperweights?

119
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,703
Last year, I bought the Christmas gifts
for the entire Jets front office.

120
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,290
Over 600 of these,
shaped like footballs.

121
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,293
- You ever get tickets?
- Lost the account.

122
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,505
To better times, huh?

123
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,138
That's so adorable,
with the animals shaped like letters.

124
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,558
I know, if I ever have a baby...

125
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,185
Yeah.

126
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,899
- What?
- Nothing.

127
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,778
Christopher talks about
having kids once in a while.

128
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,488
I don't know.

129
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,867
- Where is our angry young man?
- Out with his friends, I guess.

130
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,912
I used to date this one guy Vinnie.

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,041
He was more like a fuck buddy,
but he lived on Staten Island.

132
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,335
I swear, we'd be in
the middle of doing it...

133
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,255
...and if his goddamn
beeper went off...

134
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,716
...then he'd just leave.

135
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,219
I think he was, like, connected
or something.

136
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,307
He used to carry a gun.

137
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,063
It's probably just to protect himself.
I mean, Christopher does sometimes.

138
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,026
- When you're in a cash business...
- Stocks is a cash business?

139
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,240
Can I tell you something?

140
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,535
Sure.

141
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,176
I don't think I can have kids.

142
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,928
What? Why?

143
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:44,059
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
It's just I feel really close to you.

144
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,523
A long time ago, before Christopher even,
I had an abortion.

145
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,817
I didn't want to.
I know it was wrong...

146
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,738
...but the guy was such an asshole.
It was really the best thing.

147
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,075
Anyway, there were complications.

148
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,328
My gynecologist says...

149
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,332
...that there's a good chance
I won't be able to hold a pregnancy.

150
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,006
Oh, God, I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

151
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,677
Christopher don't even know.
My own mother, even.

152
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,680
Sometimes it helps to talk, huh?

153
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,101
They can do incredible things
these days, Ade.

154
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,938
When the time comes,
I know a great ob-gyn...

155
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,816
...that my sister went to in the city.

156
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,150
Really?

157
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,240
You just show up without calling?
I thought you were going out.

158
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,035
I'm a man of many mysteries.

159
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,122
This is Christopher's friend
Paulie Germani.

160
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,999
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

161
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:55,588
Yeah, so you put this in the back
of your freezer, it'll take out any odors.

162
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,758
Go on, buy her a drink somewheres.
I gotta talk to my fiancée.

163
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,011
- Christopher, some manners?
- I'll call you tomorrow, Ade.

164
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,099
So, what? You from around here?

165
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,103
- Something's wrong with that broad.
- Something's wrong with you.

166
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,065
Yeah? Here's what's wrong with me.

167
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,029
Holy shit.

168
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,743
Oh, my God.

169
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,371
- These diamonds...
- Harry Winston, baby.

170
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,374
It's got more carats than Bugs Bunny.

171
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,129
Christopher.

172
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,007
I had a great conversation
with Silvio today.

173
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,342
What? Tell me.

174
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,347
Let's just say that Carmela
ain't gonna be first lady forever.

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,061
Political disagreement is often a catalyst
leading to violence in a world gone mad.

176
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,607
Burning rage in Korea spilled
onto the street with deadly results.

177
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,860
Check it out.
The guy in the red jacket?

178
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,571
In like 10 seconds,
that cop's a fucking fireball.

179
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,823
I don't think I wanna see this.

180
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,411
- Janice?
- Oh, fuck, it's my brother.

181
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,455
Janice?

182
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,793
Coming. I'm coming.

183
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,131
- Hey.
- Hey.

184
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,717
- What are you doing here?
- I was at Bacala's.

185
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,012
- Figured I'd come by, say hello.
- Good. Good.

186
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,474
- How's he doing?
- He's fat.

187
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,938
Faces of Death? What,
was The Sound of Music already rented?

188
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,609
It's research for our Christian rock video
I'm coordinating with the record release.

189
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,195
That Tommy Mottola,
he's one slow motherfucker.

190
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,657
- What's it been, about a year?
- Actually, we're not going with Sony.

191
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,244
We're considering a smaller
independent label.

192
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,623
Oh, naturally. Got any coffee?

193
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,876
I may only have soy milk.

194
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,759
What?

195
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,565
What do you care, Tony?
It's none of your business anyhow.

196
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,360
- Ralph Cifaretto, Janice?
- It's always fucking something with you.

197
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,154
Why don't you stay out of
other people's living rooms.

198
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,782
Jesus Christ.

199
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,055
You look good.
Better than last time.

200
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,315
Ralph came through with those jobs.

201
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:05,028
- Well, what did Tony say?
- I guess Tony made him do it.

202
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,157
I wished Albert
a happy birthday for you.

203
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,367
Who's been to see my ma?

204
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,038
Well, I don't think anybody, Paulie.

205
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,375
Chrissy says Tony sent her
some chocolates.

206
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,504
Whoa. Chrissy said T made a killing
in real estate down Frelinghuysen.

207
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,966
That assemblyman guy
hyped him to it.

208
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,556
Ralph told this funny fucking
joke, though, at Albert's party.

209
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,100
He goes, "Ginny Sack...

210
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,855
...had a 95-pound mole
surgically taken off her ass."

211
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,941
- He said that?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,610
And you think it's funny?

213
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,821
It's in bad taste, huh?

214
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,843
The fuck?

215
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,474
No, that's not what I want.
No, no, no.

216
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,854
No, I want a 50 T's,
50 reverse. Got that?

217
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,735
Guys, pick up those
ice-cream wrappers.

218
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,703
If I were a carpenter
And you were a douche bag

219
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,249
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Breaking my balls. What's it look like?

220
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,418
I tell you, this no-show shit is tough.

221
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,505
Deciding what not to wear to work,
what not to put in my lunch box.

222
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,632
You're breaking my heart.

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,885
You should try sitting here
10:30 to 3:00.

224
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,930
You got Carson Ave?

225
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,685
Hey, you know that girl
the other night, Danielle?

226
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,021
She's a piece of ass
but fucking rude.

227
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,983
- It's all here?
- You remember to put the spores in there?

228
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,737
That's not funny.

229
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,741
- What the fuck's all that?
- Fiber-optic cable.

230
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,077
High-speed Internet access.

231
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,248
- A lot of money in this shit.
- Oh, yeah?

232
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,882
The kid was supposed to get
a job this summer, an internship.

233
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,969
Then it wasn't right for what she
was studying. Okay, that's one down.

234
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,015
Then she was gonna be a hostess at
Artie Bucco's restaurant. I got her that.

235
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,226
And there was a problem about she
couldn't work Tuesdays...

236
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,312
...because of her babysitting
commitment.

237
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,773
And Artie didn't try to understand,
so she left.

238
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,860
Then the babysitting family
disappeared to Nantucket.

239
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,906
Then something else fell through,
and then, and then, and then.

240
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,532
So she's regressing.

241
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,951
If she keeps it up,
she'll be back in the womb.

242
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,204
Over the course of a child's life...

243
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,457
...there's a constant moving away
and coming back.

244
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,876
Security versus freedom.

245
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,922
But what I find interesting,
and that's if I hear you right...

246
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,677
...is that at the age of 19, she actually
wants to stay close to home.

247
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,430
Well, see, that's what
I was gonna say.

248
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,558
- She did have someone close die.
- Jackie.

249
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,687
But she brings that up whenever you ask
her to clean up after herself or whatever.

250
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,817
- That she's traumatized.
- He was shot to death.

251
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,362
Yeah, it's tragic, that kid.

252
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:41,244
- It was some kind of drug deal, you said?
- Exactly, yeah, yeah. All the earmarks.

253
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,000
No, it's gotta be tough.

254
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,172
Then again, they'd been broken up,
and he wasn't nice to her.

255
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,843
- It may be a manipulation in part...
- She's got a hard-on about Columbia.

256
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,011
"It's so competitive."

257
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:04,308
But it doesn't mean that her pain
over Jackie's death isn't real.

258
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,814
Has she said to you or Carmela
she's depressed?

259
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,776
Oh, come on with that shit.
She's gonna be all right.

260
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,155
Maybe she should be on medication.

261
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,286
And her anger is focused
on Carmela, not on you?

262
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,288
I catch some shit.

263
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,457
But me and Med, we were
always close. Even in that...

264
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,294
...15-year-old period, you know?

265
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,713
When she could hardly
stomach Carmela?

266
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,423
Well...

267
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,217
...you are the dad.

268
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,972
The template for all future lovers.

269
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,558
She loves me.

270
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,810
I know that.

271
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,065
Since she was a tiny baby.

272
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,904
Might be helpful if she saw someone.

273
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,072
Dr. Wendi Kobler.

274
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,368
She's an adolescent psychologist
and an educational consultant.

275
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,372
Well, what do you mean? Talk about
private family stuff like I do here?

276
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,209
- With you?
- Yes.

277
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,462
Look, like you said,
she's going back to school.

278
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,632
She's gonna be with her college pals,
back to the grindstone.

279
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,092
That's all good shit.

280
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,983
I thought you had
final registration today.

281
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,614
Technically, drop-and-add
goes on for the next three weeks.

282
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,325
Well, still, shouldn't you
register for the classes...

283
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,536
...you know you want
so you don't lose them?

284
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,457
Look, I decided to take a year off.

285
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,918
You what?!

286
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,921
And do what, loaf around the house?

287
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,590
Actually, I'm going to Europe,
with Misty.

288
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,052
What are you talking about?

289
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,973
Look, Mom, I'm just not ready.

290
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,892
If I go back now,
I'll have to meet with advisers...

291
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,436
...who will at least want me
to declare a major...

292
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,982
...or independent course of study.
I'll have that to deal with.

293
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,319
And obviously, you don't
want me around here.

294
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,493
That is not what I said at all.

295
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,291
You think I don't want you here?

296
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,877
She knows what I fucking make.
Who am I, Bill Gates?

297
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,963
I already support the kids.

298
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,133
You're the bartender. You're supposed
to listen to my problems.

299
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,718
Yeah.

300
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,306
Hey, Ton, sorry I'm late. What's up?

301
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,684
You tell me. I got a call
from Jack Massarone.

302
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,770
Massarone Construction?
A very angry call.

303
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,064
The M-80 in the Porta-Pot.
I told Benny...

304
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,358
Don't fuck with me on this.

305
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,530
- The fiber-optic shit.
- You knew it was boosted?

306
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,242
No. Well, yeah, I mean,
Patsy mentioned some...

307
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,704
Jesus Christ, if I wanted
Patsy in charge...

308
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,582
Use your fucking head, Christopher.

309
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,918
I'm sorry, T, I thought I was.

310
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,380
By drawing heat
to a quarter-billion-dollar job?

311
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:26,052
Think, Christopher, think.
The big fucking picture, huh?

312
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,099
Aren't they insured?

313
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,567
She's nice, Janice, you know?
Not my usual type, but...

314
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,239
Her hair, it's pretty. Pre-Raphaelite
they call it, with the curls.

315
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,787
Nothing but net, motherfucker.

316
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,627
She does have an earthy quality,
give her that.

317
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,254
It's those big tits.

318
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,590
No disrespect.

319
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,968
Of course, there's
the issue of her family.

320
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,264
Making her happy wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world for my career.

321
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,141
Game.

322
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,523
Where you going?

323
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,278
- Come on, Ralph, I'm tired.
- Come on, one more.

324
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,242
Come on.

325
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,500
Come on, a little fucking defense, huh?

326
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,962
Hook shot.

327
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,600
Oh, thank God. Where is that number
of the therapist that Melfi gave you?

328
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,396
- Why? What happened?
- She's going to Europe, your daughter.

329
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,358
She's dropping out of school,
going all over the place on a Eurailpass.

330
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,444
- Is she fucking kidding?
- Apparently not.

331
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,447
Her passport from going to
the Bahamas is still valid.

332
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,740
- Where is she?
- I don't know, down the shore.

333
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,619
I suppose all these parties she goes to
are all memorials for Jackie Jr?

334
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,497
- Tony, please, with the yelling.
- You still online?

335
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,292
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

336
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,634
- So, what the fuck's in Europe?
- I don't know. Experience.

337
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,179
Real life. Art.

338
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,223
I knew this constant harping on art
was gonna cause trouble.

339
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,184
Gonna work in publicity or something.

340
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,353
Some friend of Misty's
is making a movie in Denmark.

341
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,565
I think we should call that therapist.

342
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,819
She's going back to school.
They got counselors there.

343
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,615
Better ones. Ivy League ones.

344
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:57,286
- No fucking way she's going to Europe.
- Fine.

345
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,997
Maybe they don't have to talk.
Maybe they're...

346
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,418
...the kind of couple that doesn't
have to talk constantly.

347
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:11,050
- One beer left?
- Danielle was over. We had pizza.

348
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,971
I figured out what's wrong with
that broad, and it's some bad shit.

349
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,519
What's the matter, baby?

350
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,896
Tony again?

351
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:30,569
I owe this guy a lot,
but he's a fucking jerk sometimes.

352
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,073
Like he never heard
of a learning curve.

353
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,284
You know what?

354
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,287
I'm gonna get high.

355
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,795
Christopher, I thought you were gonna
stop using junk because of your new job.

356
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,634
I am.

357
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,346
This is my goodbye party with heroin.

358
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,640
You wanna do a hit?

359
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,561
I don't know.
I did some blow at the club.

360
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,523
It's funny with Tony.
It's like Danielle was saying...

361
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,984
...how we send food
to the poorer countries.

362
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,779
- No good deed goes unpunished.
- What is it with you and this girl?

363
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,950
- What, I can't have friends?
- You're amazing, you know that?

364
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,996
With all of your intelligence,
you never see the big picture.

365
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,583
- You met her where?
- At the mall. So?

366
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,876
Think, Adriana, think.

367
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,046
Girl like that. Ass like that.

368
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,591
She don't have a boyfriend,
she don't like Paulie.

369
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,136
- Oh, like he's Jude Law.
- Yeah, whatever.

370
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,098
Are you that fucking blind?

371
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:50,107
- She's a dyke.
- No.

372
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,114
You think?

373
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,249
Use your head, huh?
It's a quarter-billion-dollar job.

374
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,211
- My head? It was your idea.
- Excuse me?

375
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:16,091
When the kid there, Vito,
told you how expensive the shit was...

376
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,637
...I don't know, you gave me a look.

377
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,472
A look?

378
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,515
So now you're a fucking
mind reader now?

379
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,560
Hey, it won't happen again. Christo...

380
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,232
Stop now, it'll be that much harder
to get back on track.

381
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,609
Your mother's right.

382
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,945
Just out of curiosity, what are
you planning on using for money?

383
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,073
Cheap Tickets is running a sale.

384
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,951
I can cash in the bonds Nana gave me,
and most likely, I'll be working.

385
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,412
Oh, yeah, some student film.

386
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,750
It's not a student film.
It's a feature on DV cam.

387
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,752
Alvar hangs out with Dogma.

388
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,422
He got honorable mention at the
Winnipeg Film Festival last year.

389
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,758
Oh, forget money,
what about security?

390
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,386
You think traipsing around
Europe's a smart move?

391
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,014
Like Europe's any less safe than here?

392
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,727
Look, you don't seem to get it.
I keep having images of Jackie Aprile...

393
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,898
...lying in a pool of his own blood
in some street somewhere.

394
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,903
So, what, French discos drive
away all sad thoughts?

395
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,448
What, Mom, you've never heard
of the restorative nature of travel?

396
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,450
Read Henry James.

397
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,287
Why does every college have junior year
abroad if there isn't a need for it?

398
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,332
Then why don't you wait for
junior year. It's eight months.

399
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,253
- Because I need it now.
- You wanna go to Europe? Go.

400
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,171
Clear your head.

401
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,549
Do whatever it is the hell
they do over there.

402
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,426
Thank you, I will.

403
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,264
Don't you think she should talk
to someone first? A counselor, maybe?

404
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,725
The college of hard knocks
is what she needs.

405
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,310
See how she likes it
when a gypsy lifts her wallet.

406
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,354
You can't work there
without a permit...

407
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,941
...which the French
hang on to like their balls.

408
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,824
Thank you for that united front.

409
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,368
The more we fight,
the more she's gonna wanna go.

410
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,747
She's going, Tony. I don't understand you
with this flip-flop.

411
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,293
She'll meet other boys. Maybe an actual
Italian one. Jackie will stop playing...

412
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:19,173
- You'd want her married to a foreigner?
- Married, no. Jesus.

413
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,886
Although, look at Furio.
What's so bad about him?

414
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,304
Do what you want, Tony.

415
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,432
I am not gonna stand idle
while she throws her education away.

416
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,725
What are you gonna do?

417
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,936
She's not gonna take this step
without talking to somebody.

418
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,354
Come on.

419
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,815
Dr. Melfi's person
is an educational consultant.

420
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,610
Maybe she can explain
to Meadow how dropping out now...

421
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,279
...is not gonna look at all good
to medical schools.

422
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,239
We could use an ally here, Tony.

423
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:49,369
Some adult, besides us, to toe the line
for accountability and responsibility.

424
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,338
So maybe you go on
an antidepressant to tide you over.

425
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,758
You're not paying for it.

426
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,177
I don't know, maybe.

427
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,812
Anyway, it was supposed
to be his funeral.

428
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,733
- Jack's.
- And they all stood around drinking...

429
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:26,323
...and blubbering at these egregious,
saccharine, fucking Italian ballads.

430
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,201
It was revolting.

431
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,664
- After I left the restaurant, I vomited.
- You were drinking?

432
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,667
I smoked a joint with my friends too.

433
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,545
Well, that's okay.

434
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,465
As long as you didn't
deliberately purge.

435
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:51,515
When I asked you earlier what
Dad does for a living, you said:

436
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:57,104
"Waste management, wink-wink."
What does "wink-wink" mean?

437
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,565
Okay.

438
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,609
He's like...

439
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,196
You know.

440
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,742
You mentioned Jack's father
was in the Mafia.

441
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,079
I didn't realize your dad was too.

442
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,210
There's no such thing as the Mafia.

443
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,338
I said Jackie's dad was a loan shark.

444
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,559
How did Dad react when he heard
Jack had been killed?

445
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,812
He was pretty upset.

446
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,817
He used to tell Jackie all the time,
"Don't get involved, stay in school."

447
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,778
Get involved?

448
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,947
With what?

449
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,120
Drugs.

450
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,083
Right. The X.

451
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,090
So Dad was a positive force
in Jack's life?

452
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,759
Jackie.

453
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,096
Yeah.

454
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,976
You don't like talking much
about Dad, do you?

455
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,648
It doesn't bother me.

456
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,403
Meadow, I'm gonna ask you
a question about Dad.

457
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,826
This may be very painful for you.

458
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,457
Did Dad ever molest you?

459
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,125
No.

460
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,545
I don't tell them
what we discuss, Meadow.

461
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,678
Gee, I don't think so.

462
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,139
- What about Mom?
- God, no.

463
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,603
Unless you consider obsessing about
my fucking GPA an assault, which I do.

464
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,524
Well, she has to learn that education
is a lifelong process.

465
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,069
- That's what I told them.
- A college degree is a nice thing, sure...

466
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,155
...but not at the sake
of emotional well-being.

467
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,700
That's exactly what I said.

468
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:19,746
Perhaps they should examine their
own needs to have you stay in school.

469
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,083
Blow off their self-esteem issues.

470
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,878
So you book on Columbia,
you can come back when you're ready.

471
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,883
Or I could write you a letter
to the University of Barcelona.

472
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,261
It's a hot school.

473
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,723
I'm on a consultancy there.

474
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,074
- Busy out there?
- Bachelor party.

475
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,747
Some asshole just slipped
on a lime wedge.

476
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,794
So I was talking to Patsy.

477
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,923
Sounds like Chrissy's got
a little Napoleon thing going on.

478
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,676
Yeah?

479
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,261
Good.

480
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,930
Right. Of course.

481
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,184
Nobody's denying
his leadership abilities.

482
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,396
So, what's the problem?

483
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,440
It's just...

484
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,612
I don't know. Patsy feels bad,
maybe he was passed over.

485
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,781
So, what the fuck do you care?

486
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,325
Last year, you were pushing me
to take him out.

487
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:43,413
I'm just saying, with the change
of rank and all, maybe he feels...

488
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,583
...marginalized.

489
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,127
Marginalized?

490
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,964
What the fuck does that even mean?

491
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,733
I like your pants. Leather?

492
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,486
Yeah, I got them at Bebe.

493
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,613
Fucking packed tonight.

494
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,865
Let's celebrate.

495
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,251
No, I'm gonna stick
with the champagne.

496
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,088
Oh, it's primo shit, Dannie.
We got an awesome connection.

497
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,923
It's okay.

498
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,890
So I was thinking, right?

499
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,767
What we do is start our own group.

500
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,478
I'll be the singer,
and you two can back me up.

501
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,729
- Please.
- Right.

502
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,190
What? It's so hard to rap?

503
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,652
My bitch, my ho
My ho, my bitch, my bitch-bitch

504
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,571
- What? It's a joke?
- Stop.

505
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,615
- You don't wanna back me up?
- Stop.

506
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,536
God.

507
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,206
- That's gorgeous.
- Isn't it?

508
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,667
Christopher gave it to me.

509
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,628
Yeah, you like it, huh, baby?

510
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,105
- What are you doing?!
- What?

511
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,318
- I'm gonna go.
- What? Hang out. What's the matter?

512
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,321
I'll call you tomorrow, Ade.

513
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,161
- You piece of fucking shit.
- Oh, what the fuck?!

514
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,414
I saw you. What'd you think,
you were gonna fuck the two of us?!

515
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,125
- You and those fucking videos.
- She came on to me!

516
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,586
She took my hand,
she was rubbing it on herself.

517
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,129
- Bullshit.
- Yeah?

518
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,883
Right before you came over, she was
telling me where she buys her pants.

519
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,594
Her underwear.
Fucking Bebe's. Like I give a fuck.

520
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,972
- You said she was gay.
- Who knows what her problem is?

521
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,268
A broad like her will fuck a snake.
Use your head, huh?

522
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,646
What do I want with that skank
when I got you?

523
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,606
You were saying she had a nice ass.

524
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:19,027
I was trying to say something positive
because she's your friend.

525
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,698
Come here.

526
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,540
What have I been telling you
about this pucchiacca, huh?

527
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,253
She's trying to fuck us up, Adriana.

528
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,548
And what we have is stronger
than any of that shit.

529
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,976
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,190
Son of a fucking bitch.

531
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,904
What happened to the Krazy Glue?

532
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,409
Somebody left the top off.
It dried out.

533
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,330
- What'd you want?
- Nothing, really.

534
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,958
But you should see
the floor tiles, though.

535
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,629
That got delivered to the job site?
Mexican travertine.

536
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,881
Johnny Sposato will take that shit.

537
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:26,386
No more dipping at the job
according to fucking Alfalfa.

538
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,140
But the order comes down
from Tony.

539
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,355
- Go ahead.
- What?

540
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,733
Knock off the tile?

541
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,903
- If Tony says no?
- I got your back.

542
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,613
Tony will be fine with it.

543
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,393
Hey.

544
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,314
The rotor on the washing machine broke.
Carm said I could use yours.

545
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,402
Clean out the filter this time.
Disgusting.

546
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,999
So how's your love life?

547
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,377
Why don't you mind your business.

548
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,421
Feels like it is my business,
considering I had to haul...

549
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,383
...your last boyfriend out of
your kitchen in a Hefty bag.

550
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,552
You're a miserable fuck,
you know that?

551
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,888
- You're just like Ma.
- Oh, yeah?

552
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,600
Yeah, really. With your condescension
and your sabotage.

553
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,603
For your information,
Ralph is a great guy.

554
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,606
Trust me, I got more information
than I need about Ralphie.

555
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,233
It's always something, Tony.

556
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,735
You threatened because
he has a sense of style?

557
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,613
- Sense of style?
- Ralph Lauren? Collegiate?

558
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,158
Let me ask you a question, Janice.
Do I know this guy better than you?

559
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,369
Because I'm telling you,
he's no good.

560
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,540
My happiness really drives you
crazy, doesn't it, Tony?

561
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,509
This reorganization of the bureau
could be good for both of us.

562
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,312
- Lilac Personal Shopping.
- Five fucking messages, Danielle?

563
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,524
Can't you take a hint?
Stop fucking calling here.

564
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,777
- Sweetie, don't be like that.
- Sweetie, bullshit.

565
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,573
- You're lucky I don't rip your ass.
- I thought we were friends.

566
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,617
Did you take his hand
off your leg? Did you?

567
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,162
- I tried.
- Bullshit.

568
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,248
And don't ever fucking
call me anymore.

569
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,087
Four fucking months of work.

570
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,508
Maybe if we let her cool off.

571
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,136
She thinks I tried to seduce
her fiancé, Dwight.

572
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,931
- Little shit bag that he is.
- What now?

573
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,058
Do we set someone else up?

574
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,730
And waste another five months getting
in close? Her guard will be up anyway.

575
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,359
I think we should consider
the undercover op a dead issue.

576
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,695
Let's just bring her in straight up.

577
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,451
Still in all, good work, Ciccerone.

578
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,621
Yeah, right. Thanks.

579
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,586
You know what the problem is, right?

580
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,881
She gave Moltisanti a hard-on.

581
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,676
So, what do we do?
Hire only schifosas?

582
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,389
You know, I had a dream
about her the other night.

583
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,540
Tony!

584
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,583
Tony!

585
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,211
Oh, this boring cocksucker.

586
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,380
Jehovah's Witnesses
are more interesting.

587
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,925
Jack, how's your balls?
What are you doing here?

588
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,636
Yeah, I got a foursome
with some city engineers.

589
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,805
- You got a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

590
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:43,017
- Artie Bucco, Jack Massarone.
- Sure, you been in my restaurant.

591
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,771
- Problem with the stracciatelli, right?
- Yeah.

592
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,648
Come.

593
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,656
- It's all right.
- Listen, I don't mean to be a pest...

594
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,908
...but your guys...
I'll take care of that.

595
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,371
This is not the fiber optics.
I'm talking about the floor tiles.

596
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,667
- What floor tiles?
- Last night, somebody hijacked a trailer.

597
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,212
The truck crushed a shed
on its way out too.

598
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,976
Christopher, my mother's expecting us.

599
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,812
Hoho!

600
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,523
Look what the cat dragged in.

601
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,444
Fucking greedy cocksucker.
You had to come back for more, huh?

602
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,238
- Fucking floor tiles now.
- You little fucking prick.

603
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,408
- Come on. Come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax, fellas.

604
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,620
- Mind your own fucking business.
- What did I say?

605
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,789
I distinctly told you to lay off
this fucking job.

606
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,667
Talk to Silvio! He gave the order,
you stupid fuck.

607
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,129
Yeah? What did you call me, huh?

608
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,507
That's right. That's right.
Little fucking tough guy, huh?

609
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,509
- You bastard.
- Chris, come on.

610
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:02,930
You work for me, not fucking Silvio.
I told you to knock it off.

611
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,932
I'm calling the police.

612
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,353
Don't think I forgot about you going
through my fiancée's underwear.

613
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,981
- That wasn't me, you fucking jerk.
- We'll see, huh?

614
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,736
So...

615
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,240
...who the fuck are you?
Ralph Bunche over here?

616
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,117
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You motherfucker.

617
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,453
- Oh, my God.
- Pat! Pat!

618
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,164
- Let me go.
- Get out of here. Let's get out of here.

619
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,584
Get him to a fucking hospital.
Make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

620
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,587
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

621
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,174
For right, he's the one.

622
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,011
I never said they shouldn't get engaged.

623
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,846
Mom.

624
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,975
Hi, can I have a tuna san?

625
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,401
- Will you hang up that phone, please?
- Excuse me?

626
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,823
Can I call you back?

627
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,581
- Did you go to see Dr. Kobler?
- Yeah.

628
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,960
- Well, what did you talk about?
- I don't have to tell you or Dad.

629
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,545
It's confidential.

630
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,339
This is what we pay $200 for?

631
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:22,135
It was your idea. I only saw her
out of a gesture of goodwill.

632
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,845
Tony!

633
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,888
I don't know what you're
so upset about.

634
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,683
It's my right to go to Europe.
That's what she said.

635
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,311
I don't care what she said.
She's totally irresponsible.

636
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,859
What?

637
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:41,279
The therapist told her it is her right
to go to Europe.

638
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

639
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,410
She actually thinks
this is a good idea...?

640
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,005
She actually thinks
this is a good idea?

641
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,717
She said it's no big deal. I can pick up
my education wherever, whenever.

642
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,219
- Oh, really?
- Wendi can get me into school...

643
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,180
...in Barcelona if I decided to stay.

644
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,807
- Who's Wendi?
- Dr. Wendi Kobler.

645
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,017
Barcelona.

646
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,103
I could take Melfi's head
and crush it like a walnut.

647
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:18,524
- I feel battered.
- I've gotta get to the salon.

648
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:22,153
Did you tell Wendi that you
didn't work all summer?

649
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,906
Wait, you're right.

650
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,409
I forgot to mention the pivotal role
of the work ethic in this family.

651
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,828
You can lose that smart mouth
right now.

652
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,998
Or what? What is this, Afghanistan?

653
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,502
I'm over 18 now. I'm a grown woman.
I can do what I want.

654
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,798
All right! Jesus, God, we know that.
Is that your only point here?!

655
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,260
Because just getting what you want
is for babies, not adults.

656
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,768
It may interest you to know she also
thinks I should be on Prozac.

657
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,728
- She does?
- She said that?

658
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,356
Jackie was murdered.
I know you think...

659
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,317
...it's nothing that the Columbia/Army
game wouldn't cure.

660
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,362
- That is so unfair.
- All right, look.

661
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,697
I've been thinking about this.

662
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,785
Now, you're a smart girl.
The right move for you is to wait.

663
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,287
Just till next year, maybe.

664
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,998
You know what I don't
understand, Dad?

665
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,711
- You were all in favor of me going.
- Your mother doesn't want it.

666
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,257
Wow, listen to Mr. Mob Boss.

667
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,135
- What did you call me?
- All this fucking pussyfooting around.

668
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,097
Years now. Why don't we just
get it all out there.

669
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,890
- Tony...
- Shut up.

670
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,353
You got something you
wanna say to me?

671
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,107
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean? What do you mean?

672
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,485
All these innuendoes.
You inferring to me that I didn't do...

673
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,364
...everything I could to keep that kid
from fucking himself up?

674
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,577
That, yeah, knowing him
and his family...

675
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,831
...that I didn't try to be a better dad to
him than his own dad, God rest his soul?

676
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,543
That I didn't try to protect Jackie Jr?
That I didn't smack him around...

677
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,380
...because I was so frustrated?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

678
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:09,343
I'm through telling people you help
with environmental cleanup.

679
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,803
That's not what I asked.

680
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,306
Like you could talk honestly
for three seconds...

681
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,766
You try me!

682
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,569
I made my plans. I'm going to Europe,
and I'm getting the fuck out of here!

683
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,654
- You've been told no.
- Watch me.

684
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,742
Don't do it! I'm warning you,
do not do it.

685
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:46,297
Do it for Mommy. That's a good girl.

686
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,436
Adriana La Cerva?
I'm Special Agent Dwight Harris, FBI.

687
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,480
I believe you two have already met.

688
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,566
- Holy fucking shit.
- Don't make a scene.

689
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,819
- You don't wanna attract attention.
- You're in the fucking FBI?

690
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,197
We need to talk.
It'll only take a half-hour.

691
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,534
- I assure you it's in your best interest.
- Could you come with us, please?

692
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:19,497
- My dog.
- It's okay. Just take her with you.

693
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,717
Am I under arrest?

694
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:36,055
Not at this time, but that can
all change momentarily.

695
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:41,060
That's a search warrant:
your office, your club, your cocaine.

696
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,771
- It's not my cocaine.
- Really?

697
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,024
- That's not what I have on tape.
- You were fucking taping me?

698
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:51,237
If I were you, I'd put aside
my hurt feelings for a while.

699
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,287
I told you shit in confidence that
had nothing to do with any of this shit.

700
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,665
Things I never told no one.

701
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,251
We're offering you a way out, Ade.

702
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,795
A chance to save your life
and Christopher's life.

703
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:12,842
You don't give a fuck about us.
You and your fucking ob-gyn doctor.

704
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,386
You wanted me
and Christopher together...

705
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,097
...long enough
so you could find shit out.

706
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,900
We understand your fiancé
is moving up in the world.

707
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,654
- Or down, as the case may be.
- Problems at the Esplanade site.

708
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,365
Oh, my God.

709
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,200
We're not asking you
to wear a wire.

710
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:43,539
We're not asking you to testify.
We just want information.

711
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,293
Is your name even Danielle?

712
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,056
What if I say no?

713
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,725
If you say no, you'll be placed
under arrest...

714
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,103
...and charged with possession
and intent to distribute cocaine.

715
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,941
A charge that carries with it a penalty
of up to 25 years in prison.

716
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,193
Oh, my God.

717
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,029
After you make bail
you can explain to Tony Soprano...

718
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,407
...why you brought an undercover
federal agent into his home.

719
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,327
- My God.
- We'll never hear about it, though.

720
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,039
Chances are you and Christopher
will just disappear.

721
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,254
Get the wastebasket.

722
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,065
Come on.

723
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,238
Ton, I left three messages,
are you okay?

724
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,158
You look like shit.

725
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,871
I didn't sleep too good.

726
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,748
It's Meadow.

727
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,293
I don't know, we think
maybe she ran off to Europe.

728
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,463
- Europe?
- Yeah.

729
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,844
- So you got a minute?
- Who's that?

730
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,179
Nobody, go back to sleep.

731
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,558
- Oh, hey, Sil.
- How you doing, hon?

732
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,866
This floor-tile shit. Misunderstanding.

733
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,785
Patsy. Christopher.

734
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,248
It's a huge job, Sil.

735
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,625
Lot of money at stake.

736
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,919
You of all people should know that.

737
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,422
What, are you mad at me now?

738
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,135
You know, you're getting to be a
very strange man in your old age.

739
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,887
What?

740
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,972
I'm just asking.

741
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,726
Is it a hanging offense or not?

742
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:14,064
- Did you deliberately disobey me?
- Of course not.

743
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,110
Because Patsy says you gave the okay.

744
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:23,240
- This is after Chrissy talked to him.
- The time line got fucked up.

745
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,870
- We go back a long way, Sil.
- Indeed we do.

746
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,707
If, in any way, you feel like
Chrissy usurped you...

747
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,878
...or anything like that,
and you're trying to ream me...

748
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,506
That's not how it is.

749
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,091
Fine.

750
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,386
The whole thing...

751
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,555
...a misunderstanding.

752
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,731
A truckload of floor tiles.

753
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,526
You should be looking
at what, 30 grand?

754
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:06,867
Should be about 2 grand there.
I'll have the rest for you later.

755
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,204
I know you will.

756
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,970
What? You catch some shrapnel?

757
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:34,561
Intro to Social Theory is...
Sorry, it's closed out.

758
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:40,359
You're cutting it a little close
for most of the popular classes.

759
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:54,164
- What about this one?
- 09531?

760
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,753
It's your lucky day.

761
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,855
Hey.

762
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,650
I've been thinking, and if you want...

763
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,446
...we can talk to your cousin Brian
about the estate planning.

764
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,450
Listen to him now.
What, do you feel guilty?

765
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,952
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

766
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,372
It's me she blames.

767
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,959
What for?
