1
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,026
And now the news.

2
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,538
You wanna take it for a test drive?

3
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:59,178
Last week we talked about you
feeling like the sad clown.

4
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,107
What's going on now?

5
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,613
Well, I had a dream the other night.

6
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,329
I was riding in a Cadillac
like my father used to have.

7
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,206
Carmela was driving.

8
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,209
I was in the back passenger seat.

9
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,003
Sitting next to me was Gloria.

10
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:37,382
In front of me, sitting next to Carmela
was a business associate of mine.

11
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,093
He's the one whose son
had the accident.

12
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,264
I don't know where we were going.
No place.

13
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,227
At least, we never seemed
to get anywhere.

14
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,023
Kind of like this therapy.

15
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,026
And it was hot in the car,
it was stuffy.

16
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,737
There was no air conditioning.

17
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,201
That's all of it.

18
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,082
Oh, and...

19
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,210
...my friend had a caterpillar
on his head.

20
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,130
It turned into a butterfly.

21
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,217
Has your friend recently changed?

22
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,553
Not friend. Associate.

23
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,182
- And, no.
- What do you think the dream means?

24
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,228
Can't you just tell me what the fucking
thing means? You obviously know.

25
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,731
Why do we have to go through
this exercise every time?

26
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,694
I don't obviously know.
I didn't have the dream.

27
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,613
The meaning is elicited
through verbalization.

28
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,451
And the "gehoxagogen" is framed up
by the "ramistam."

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,208
Okay.

30
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,630
Your wife, your mistress,
a business associate, you...

31
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,966
...all in the same car.

32
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,343
- Your father's car.
- With my wife driving.

33
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,137
Which, if my father were alive...

34
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,806
...he wouldn't have stood for
for two seconds.

35
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,184
- I hear anger.
- No, I'm just saying...

36
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,603
...the old guys were different.

37
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,647
Men in the front, wives in the back.

38
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,190
You like that arrangement.

39
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,153
Actually, I think the wives should
ride in a little cart, behind the car.

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,196
Like in the cartoons.

41
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,158
Like behind Noah's Ark,
there's a boat with the skunks.

42
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,743
So wives are skunks.

43
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,454
Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ.
It's a fucking joke.

44
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,998
Does it have to be like
a cancer hospital in here?

45
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,292
But Carmela is in control
in the dream.

46
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,129
- Why, because she's driving?
- Whatever's gone on with the other two...

47
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,839
...you wanna square it with her.

48
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,633
- Why?
- That's what we need to find out.

49
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,345
Freud says dreams are wishes.

50
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,556
Dreams are wishes?

51
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,019
I thought you said that dreams represent
repressed urges and...

52
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,064
- It depends.
- I ought to quit this fucking therapy.

53
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,692
Maybe it's this, maybe it's that.
Maybe it's va fangool!

54
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,819
What about impulse control?

55
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,281
I've been sitting here for 4 years
and nothing's been done about that!

56
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,492
And it leads me to make mistakes
at work!

57
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,369
What good did you do me
with that?!

58
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,167
- Let's get back to the dream.
- Fuck the dream. It's just a dream.

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,796
The money I been dropping here,
I could've bought a Ferrari.

60
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,881
At least I would've got a blow job.

61
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,927
- What do you mean?
- Please, huh? Don't get me started.

62
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:31,181
You're glossing over the significant
accomplishments we've made in here.

63
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,059
"Oh, my mother would come
when she looked at a pot roast.

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,770
Oh, you're second
in the birthing order.

65
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,566
Oh, Carmela's driving the car,
how fucking interesting."

66
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,573
When you first came here,
you were clinically depressed.

67
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,620
You suffered from panic attacks
that put your life in danger.

68
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,915
There's been significant relief
in both those areas.

69
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,251
You're right, but...

70
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,964
I mean, come on.
I've been coming here four years now.

71
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,466
I've been a good sport.

72
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,266
Sophia, your jacket.

73
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,561
You're just getting over a cold.
Come on.

74
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,172
I miss you so much.

75
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,469
I'd be with you right now
if it wasn't for the kids.

76
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,937
We want a 40-percent position
in your HUD business.

77
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,649
Because I bet on the other thing,
you reach into my pocket on this?

78
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,443
That was a gesture of goodwill.

79
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,446
Tony, we've been down
this road before.

80
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,697
We share Zellman.

81
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,494
Therefore, any of the fruits of Zellman,
we're entitled to.

82
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,163
- We done here?
- Fucking Ralph.

83
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,290
Where's your point man on this thing?

84
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,502
- He missed his drops this week.
- I don't know.

85
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,004
Maybe you can tell me.

86
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,639
About what we expected.

87
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,685
Bloomin' Onion. Cool.

88
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,690
The steak with the toothpick is Daddy's.
He likes it still mooing.

89
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,030
I saw on CNBC that Outback's
profitability is...

90
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,032
- Excuse me.
- Dad?

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,493
Sit. Sit and eat.

92
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,954
It's a sin to waste good food.

93
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,458
Try the mushrooms. I don't know what
they do to them, but they're delicious.

94
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,966
Bobby?

95
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,594
I'm all right.

96
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,722
The kids are fed.

97
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,224
Thank you.

98
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,227
Bobby, what did you do
with the cake today?

99
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,603
Cake?

100
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,022
Your daughter said she saw it
in your car.

101
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,568
She told me about it
when I picked her up from practice.

102
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,075
I took it to Karen's grave.

103
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,079
I buried it.

104
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,750
Today was our anniversary.

105
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,214
Fourteen years.

106
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,927
I wish you would've told me before
I picked up the steaks from Outback.

107
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,098
The sides alone were over $30.

108
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,230
- How often do you go to the grave?
- Every day.

109
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,275
That's what I miss the most,
talking to her.

110
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,409
Believe me, Bobby, I know.
I lost both my parents.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,120
It's very easy for people
to give facile advice.

112
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,956
"Suck it up, move on," et cetera.

113
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,668
I'm not gonna tell you that.
Grieving is a process.

114
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,963
Sometimes courage isn't a value.

115
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,804
Tony.

116
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,641
- Hello?
- Look.

117
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,977
Let's not let it get out of hand.
We've been doing good business.

118
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,313
Carmine agrees. I agree.

119
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,609
Well, 40 percent's not gonna happen.
Now, we all know it.

120
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm willing to go five and a half.

121
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,864
Five and a half.

122
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,115
Hello?

123
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,659
Not acceptable.

124
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,000
This guy who does
the housing appraisals for Tony.

125
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,670
Vic the Appraiser they call him.

126
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,797
Joey.

127
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,178
I want you to pay a visit
to this Polack...

128
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,181
...Tony Soprano's got doing
phony house appraisals.

129
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,683
Vic the Appraiser.

130
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,519
Make this guy understand
that he'll be working for us.

131
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,896
On these shit-hole houses
we bought in Jersey.

132
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,314
You got it.

133
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,534
Why did he get her a cake? She died.

134
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,703
Go back to bed.

135
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,248
Nicky Ghilardi said Mommy's ghost
is gonna come back and haunt us.

136
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,251
There's no such things as ghosts.

137
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,048
The cake...

138
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,219
...maybe it was for the nuns.

139
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,224
Sometimes when I'm walking down
the hallway I can smell her hair.

140
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,440
Well, maybe if we did something bad,
she'd haunt us for our own good.

141
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,864
There's nothing to be scared of.
Go back to bed.

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,461
Tony's pretty hot
that you didn't counteroffer.

143
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,756
God forbid if this gets really bad...

144
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,800
...there could be a change.

145
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,595
Tony?

146
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,265
Suffice to say, no matter what
happens now or in the future...

147
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,769
...Carmine won't forget you.

148
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,106
And as far as us talking like this...

149
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,108
It's just because we're old friends.

150
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,278
And I know I can blow off
a little steam with you.

151
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,447
Cheaper than the bartender.

152
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,950
I'm only trying to bring good relations
between the families.

153
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,495
As I always do and always will.

154
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,498
No matter what happens,
or who's in charge.

155
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,417
If it's me, God forbid...

156
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,627
...or whoever.

157
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,342
- Hey, Branca. How you doing?
- Hello.

158
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,639
- Is he around?
- Shaving.

159
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,352
- How's your boss?
- Shaving, his face.

160
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,147
No, your employer there,
Miss Kirilenko?

161
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,525
Fine.

162
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:43,112
Reason I'm asking is because
we didn't get the bill.

163
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,619
- Here he is.
- I've fucking had it.

164
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,664
- With what?
- Everything.

165
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,295
- Did you offer my nephew something?
- I'm a registered nurse.

166
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,505
Not maid.

167
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,258
Did you offer him an aspirin?

168
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,805
Cunt.

169
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,810
What's with you?

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,564
This fucking competency hearing.

171
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,358
Delayed twice
and now it's coming up on Friday.

172
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,194
I don't know whether
to chill champagne or shit in my pants.

173
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,404
No, it's gonna be...

174
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,032
You got shaving cream all over you.

175
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,785
Don't you wash yourself off?

176
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,372
It's over here too.

177
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,332
It's that fucking lighting upstairs.

178
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,335
If Bobby put in the right wattage...

179
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,175
Listen. We find out where
the jurors meet every day...

180
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,720
...before they get bused
to the courthouse.

181
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,930
This mental competency
thing don't work...

182
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,391
I don't wanna talk about it.

183
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,398
So, what is the story there
with you two?

184
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,819
He's a great guy.
He's just still very much in mourning.

185
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,779
We're stuck at platonic.

186
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,574
Well, Karen was a wonderful person.

187
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,912
I'm sure God must have his reasons,
but sometimes you have to wonder.

188
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,374
Well, I'm sure she was as good as gold,
but he's developing a psychosis.

189
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,627
Her clothes are still in the closet.

190
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,089
Yesterday he bought her a cake for their
anniversary and he buried it at her grave.

191
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,091
What? At her grave?

192
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,218
God forbid
that I should say something.

193
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,262
Then I would be perceived
as a harpy...

194
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,265
...coming between him
and his dead, idealized wife.

195
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,395
Listen, you, don't make
any plans for Sunday.

196
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,856
Baccalieris are coming,
make them feel welcome.

197
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,361
- Bobby Jr? That kid's, like, 11.
- I don't ask you to do chore one.

198
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,614
You can go without seeing Devin
and your friends for one night.

199
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,868
Yeah, we were supposed to study.
But I guess you don't care about that.

200
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,586
Vic?

201
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,880
Yo, Vic.

202
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,385
- You don't return Johnny's phone calls?
- What did you say?

203
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,805
I'm only the appraiser!

204
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,487
Let me appraise you of this.
Be at the Red Chimney on Route 3...

205
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,491
...9:00 tomorrow morning ready
to go to work for Johnny and Carmine.

206
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,125
Victor's scared now.

207
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,169
- Nobody knows where he is.
- Look, it's a bluff.

208
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,505
They don't wanna start
a separate operation.

209
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:52,176
You know the costs that are involved?
You got the appraiser, the poverty pimp.

210
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,345
They want in on a going thing.

211
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,639
Want me to pay a visit
to Johnny Sack's guys?

212
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,933
Just say the word.

213
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,686
No. You know what?

214
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,856
- I'm not gonna go fucking ballistic.
- All due respect, T...

215
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,694
...throwing your appraiser a beating
was a provocation to you directly.

216
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,489
There he is.

217
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,452
Stop beeping that fucking horn
or I'm gonna shove it up his fucking ass!

218
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,662
T, Sil.

219
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,873
- All right, Sil.
- Enjoy the game.

220
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,168
- I'll see you, Ton.
- All right, Vit.

221
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,923
You ever talk to Beansie
down there in Florida?

222
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,508
Now and then.

223
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,595
Does he ever run into Carmine's son
down there in Miami?

224
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,556
I'll be on my cell, you need me.

225
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,774
Beans tells me he sees Little Carmine
all the time.

226
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,568
Well, maybe Beans can feel him out.

227
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,863
See if he's receptive to a meeting
with me.

228
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,742
Maybe we can work this shit out,
he talks to his old man.

229
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,703
Beansie's gotta happen
to run into him.

230
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,373
Not like we're asking.

231
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,089
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

232
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,758
- Look at that.
- Just stuffed artichokes.

233
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,554
- No cactus for me.
- Cactus.

234
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,599
You're not Italian
if you don't like artichokes.

235
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,977
So, what, Mike Piazza
eats nothing but artichokes?

236
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,105
I mean, that's dicked up.

237
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,774
All right.

238
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,819
I like rice. Maybe I'm Chinese.

239
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,118
- A.J.
- You too, Bobby.

240
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,578
How'd you like if Oriental kids
made fun of you?

241
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:43,830
I'll get it.

242
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,832
- You want an artichoke, Bobby Jr?
- No.

243
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,667
It's dinnertime.

244
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,628
You sure, B.J?
You're really missing out.

245
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,421
I said already.

246
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,138
Hi. Hello. Hi, Mrs. Soprano.

247
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,474
Everybody, this is Devin.

248
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,271
- Devin, would you like something to eat?
- No, thank you, I'll just wait inside.

249
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,319
She tell you who I saw
at Schantz's Hardware?

250
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,656
Oh, God. Do you have to tell
every person you run into?

251
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,702
I'll put an end to the mystery right now.
Connie Francis.

252
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,662
Excuse me.

253
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,290
She was looking at recessed lighting.

254
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,001
I put in recessed lighting.
But I'm sorry now.

255
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,003
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.

256
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,505
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine fettle.

257
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,093
Listen, I spoke to our friend.
The son. He seemed very receptive.

258
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,012
Tuesday night.

259
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,681
We'll meet down here in FLA.

260
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,016
We'll pick a place later.

261
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,852
I got my stepdaughter
and her friends this weekend.

262
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,355
- I'm gonna have to bring them along.
- Okay, good. Good.

263
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,399
Thanks.

264
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,109
Somebody will call you.

265
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,739
- Where is Anthony?
- He went upstairs with that girl.

266
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,367
You two, come with me.

267
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,623
Anthony!

268
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,879
- That door is not supposed to be closed.
- We were studying.

269
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,341
- Is this how you treat your guests?
- My guests? You invited them.

270
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,429
These kids just lost their mom.
Could you give them a little time?

271
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,641
- You know how much Bobby likes you.
- What am I, daycare?

272
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,354
You must have a million games in here.
Clue, Monopoly.

273
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,564
Help them pick something out.

274
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,193
Come on in, kids.
A.J.'s gonna help you find a game.

275
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,411
Spirit...

276
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,248
...speak to me.

277
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,376
Is Bobby Jr. gay?

278
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,381
No, do it again for real,
like last time with the dead little baby.

279
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,091
Yeah, quit messing around.

280
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,760
Okay. Serious.

281
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,721
Spirits, identify yourself.

282
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,100
- You're forcing it again.
- Shut up.

283
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,772
- Do you think it's my mom?
- Probably not. It's not people you know.

284
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,899
- Will you do it with me, Devin?
- Okay.

285
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,489
Spirit...

286
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,575
...do you know Karen Baccalieri?
Sophia.

287
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,086
Is she making new friends in heaven?

288
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,963
Maybe we should play something else.

289
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,633
- Yeah, this is stupid. Let's play Clue.
- You're just a scared little baby.

290
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,469
I'm not scared.
I have this game at home.

291
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,097
I used to play it all the time.

292
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,807
Until it got boring.

293
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,645
How about we try
and contact the dead for real?

294
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,649
Just heard from our friend. The other
guy will sit down. I'm going on Tuesday.

295
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,360
- Want me there?
- I was thinking of bringing Paulie.

296
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,946
Face time with you could be
what he needs.

297
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,782
- He's on the rag lately.
- Then I decided against it.

298
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,286
The other day,
we were talking about Florida.

299
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,122
I noticed you clammed up
around Paulie.

300
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,041
You did too.

301
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,501
It occurred to me that
maybe Paulie's the one...

302
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,879
...telling our friend
in New York our business.

303
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,006
Somebody had to pass along
that fat joke.

304
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,342
He was in Youngstown at the time.
In the can.

305
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,260
What, people can't visit him?

306
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,680
Jesus, you believe this shit?

307
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,557
Talking about fucking Paulie here.

308
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,686
He's got no reason to know about
the trip. Nobody's got a reason to know.

309
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,690
Absolutely.
It's on a need-to-know basis.

310
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,903
Get this fucking appraiser working again.
I got houses just sitting there.

311
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,906
You gotta hold hands.

312
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,492
And nobody let go.

313
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,872
The most important thing...

314
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,708
...is that you keep your eyes closed
during the ceremony.

315
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,878
Because if you open them,
whatever spirits we're speaking to...

316
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,924
...will permanently remain trapped
between worlds forever.

317
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,304
Everybody's eyes shut?

318
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,311
Oh, great spirit from beyond.

319
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,940
Reveal yourself.

320
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,693
Give us a sign of your presence.

321
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,406
- A.J!
- Keep laughing if you think it's funny.

322
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,324
It was you.

323
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,535
- You hear that?
- What?

324
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,412
- I heard it.
- Me too.

325
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,415
Wait. I see a...

326
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,750
A gray mist...

327
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,253
...with little specks of light.

328
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,755
- That's what I'm seeing too.
- Wait!

329
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,926
I see somebody. An old man.

330
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,055
Spirit from another dimension,
can you reveal yourself?

331
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,725
What?

332
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,271
- What's that?
- How come he's only talking to you?

333
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,567
Because I'm the oldest
and closest to the afterlife.

334
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,613
You're a sea captain?

335
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,782
Capt. Jacobus?

336
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,117
What?

337
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,286
He says it's a terrible storm.

338
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,289
It's raining where you are?

339
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,459
Waves are smashing against the boat?

340
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,711
AAH!
AAH!

341
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,463
She's here! She's here!

342
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,132
Oh, Jesus Christ.

343
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,303
What's going on?

344
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,804
Oh, my God. What happened?

345
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,265
Nothing. We were just playing.

346
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,685
We were playing Ouija board,
and then A.J. did this séance.

347
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,980
Dad, I wanna go home.

348
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,650
Soph, it's just a Ouija board.

349
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,696
She's just scared.

350
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,364
It's okay, honey. Daddy's here.

351
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,493
This is your idea of fun?
You scared these kids half to death!

352
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,495
I didn't do anything, he freaked out.

353
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,205
Why's your shirt all wet?

354
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,457
Bobby, look! He had a sponge!

355
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,168
After what we just talked about,
this is what you do.

356
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,504
- You asshole! You asshole!
- Robert!

357
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,549
You, say good night.

358
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,052
You, get out of my sight.

359
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,138
I can't remember a time when
I was more disappointed in you.

360
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,348
Wanna know something?

361
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,684
He locked me in the garage at the guy
with the ponytail's house.

362
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,021
Bobby, I don't even know what to say.
I am so embarrassed.

363
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,025
Part of growing up.
Don't worry about it.

364
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,327
I'm only the appraiser!

365
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,543
Do you think you could hide from us?

366
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,546
Tony bought three more houses
that need appraisals, Victor.

367
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,089
I can't. I told you. Please!

368
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,008
Johnny and Carmine's guys,
they hurt me.

369
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,595
That's nothing compared
to what we're gonna do.

370
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:01,600
So go back inside, get your appraising
shit and start appraising!

371
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,233
Did you like the movie?

372
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,571
What's the matter?

373
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,116
You went to the cemetery today,
didn't you?

374
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,201
How do you know?

375
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,579
Because you got cemetery mud
on your shoes.

376
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,582
Mud? What are you,
Marg Helgenberger now?

377
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,501
What do you know about the mud?
You been spying on me?

378
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,379
What, I can't go to the cemetery?

379
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,800
- I gotta get permission from you?
- We're talking about you. Not me.

380
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,596
The grave and the funeral...
It's never-ending.

381
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,014
You don't wanna let it go.

382
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,559
- Did you even pay the funeral bill yet?
- I'm never gonna pay him.

383
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,937
Son of a bitch put an extra 15 pounds
on Karen when they did her up.

384
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,109
This dispute with the bill
is morbid clinging.

385
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,611
This is exactly what I mean.

386
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,614
We have a nice evening
and end up talking about your wife.

387
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,033
- You invited me.
- The other night at Tony's...

388
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,328
...your kids were trying
to contact Karen on a Ouija board.

389
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,622
What do you expect
talking to a headstone?

390
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,417
- She's my wife.
- Well, she's dead. And I'm here.

391
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,628
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

392
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,492
- Yeah.
- Tony, it's Svetlana.

393
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,870
- Well, hey.
- I've just receiving the brooch.

394
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,872
I want to thank you.

395
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,876
- I don't know why I deserve it, but...
- No, I don't wanna hear that.

396
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,128
I want you to keep it.

397
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,048
I'm gonna keep it, don't worry.

398
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,841
Diamonds like this?

399
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,551
OH.

400
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,596
It's a very nice gift. Very sweet.

401
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,308
And what's happened between us...

402
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,851
...it was nice too.

403
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,604
Okay. Well...

404
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,606
...that's it then?

405
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,025
These things happen
and then life goes on.

406
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,319
Are you sure? Because if...

407
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,988
...you ever wanna talk
or if you ever need anything...

408
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,617
No, it's all right.
Thank you for the brooch.

409
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,251
Broke a woman's heart.

410
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,046
Told her I couldn't see her no more.
Sad, but there's no getting around it.

411
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,007
- Who is she?
- She takes care of my uncle.

412
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,052
Runs an eldercare agency.

413
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,721
Took care of my mother too.

414
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,517
- Your former girlfriend's cousin?
- That one, yeah.

415
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,563
- Is she your current goomar?
- No, it was a brief fling kind of thing.

416
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,401
You know, but after a while,
I felt like I had to cut off the leg...

417
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,904
Not leg, affair. Did I say, leg?

418
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,283
- Why did you cut it off?
- Jesus, I am married.

419
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,411
- What happened?
- I bought her the...

420
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:13,083
It's this diamond pin that I send
to every woman when I'm...

421
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,754
...easing out the door.
I'm such a fucking prick.

422
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,090
You know what?

423
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,593
This is all bullshit.

424
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,096
It was she who gave me
my walking papers.

425
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,098
- You believe that?
- What I meant was...

426
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,100
You know why she didn't want
to see me?

427
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,102
She said I was high-maintenance.

428
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,939
This is after all the time and all
the money and all the fucking Prozac...

429
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,610
...and all the fucking cocksucking,
motherfucking dream interpretations.

430
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,695
She says she didn't want
to prop me up.

431
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,908
And this from a broad that walks
around on crutches half the time.

432
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,618
Nice, huh?

433
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,120
Do you agree
with her characterization of you?

434
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,457
I'm a miserable prick.
I've said it since day one.

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,126
And you're no longer interested
in changing.

436
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,961
In finding a way out.

437
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,095
No, I guess not.

438
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,978
I said this last time,
you didn't want to hear it.

439
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,606
You're paying me for my honest opinion.

440
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,817
You should be in therapy.

441
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,654
All this fucking self-knowledge,
what the fuck has it gotten me?

442
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,492
Okay, maybe it got me some shit in the
beginning. Some leadership strategies.

443
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,203
All we do now is we sit around
shooting the breeze...

444
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,373
...about philosophy, the Italians,
my Uncle Eckley.

445
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,500
I try to keep the focus on the work.

446
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,504
So when it goes off, it's my fault?
Okay, fine. I accept that.

447
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,050
You know what she says?

448
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,386
This broad?

449
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,973
She's from Russia. Dirt poor.

450
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,144
She had some kind of "osocarma" disease
in her leg when she was 9.

451
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:00,399
She says that nowhere else in the world
do people expect to be happy...

452
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,695
...except for here in this country. And
still, we're not. And we got everything.

453
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,698
And when we're not, what do we do?
We go to shrinks.

454
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,658
For what, 6, 7 bucks a minute?

455
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,202
There's some truth to what she says.

456
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,496
But should that be a source of shame?

457
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,293
That when the desperate struggle for
food and shelter is finally behind us...

458
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:24,548
...we can turn our attention
to other sources of pain and truth?

459
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:29,011
Pain and truth. Come on.
I'm a fat fucking crook from New Jersey.

460
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,345
Anthony.

461
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,724
Now that the panic attacks
and the baseline depression...

462
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,894
...have been dealt with,
the real work can begin.

463
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,063
- I knew you'd say something like that.
- Because it's true.

464
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,067
When we're not constantly having
to put out fires...

465
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,236
...we can really delve
into who you are...

466
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:52,200
...and what you're really after
in your very brief time on this earth.

467
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,415
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,293
I don't wanna do this anymore.

469
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,462
And you can say
that I'm running away.

470
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,756
I've been here longer
than I'd ever thought.

471
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,926
Longer than anybody
ever thought I'd stay.

472
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,429
And you know what?
I get no appreciation for it.

473
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,057
You've shown a lot of courage.

474
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,600
I commend you on that.

475
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,645
Well, thank you
for the commendation and...

476
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,396
...adiós.

477
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,654
Look, no fault, no foul.

478
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,239
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

479
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,451
Come to your next appointment.
One more time.

480
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,914
You'll cover my $300 a week
in no time with some other mortadella.

481
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,583
All right, I shouldn't have said that.

482
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,337
Look, you saved my life
in the beginning.

483
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,299
And for all the times I came on
like an asshole, I'm very sorry.

484
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,473
You've got my number
if you change your mind.

485
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,602
And if you begin to feel any of
the old feelings, you need to call me.

486
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,979
No.

487
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,443
So, what's customary?
I mean, we shake hands? What?

488
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,197
How about a diamond pin?

489
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,004
Okay, well...

490
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,964
Goodbye.

491
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,313
You've reached Dr. Elliot Kupferberg.

492
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,524
Please leave a message at the beep.

493
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,192
If this is an emergency...

494
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,532
...you can reach me at 973-555-7089.

495
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,996
Well, guess who's no longer
a patient of mine.

496
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,541
Calling all cars.

497
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:19,157
His user name had 666.
That means Satan.

498
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:43,890
HO!

499
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,645
- I was gonna park in that spot.
- Hey, ball breaker. Welcome to Miami.

500
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,151
Mr. Melvoin,
I've read your application...

501
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,154
...for dismissal on the grounds
of mental incompetence.

502
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,073
I've reviewed the findings
of the doctors in this matter.

503
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:04,953
Frankly, they were unmoved
by Mr. Soprano's performance.

504
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,623
Your Honor, to couch it
as a performance...

505
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,459
It's their opinion that he understands
the charges...

506
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,337
...and that he's competent
to participate in his defense.

507
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,840
- I'd like another round of testing.
- Your Honor...

508
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:22,012
Mr. Castleman. I didn't come all this
way to stop this trial now.

509
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,557
Court will convene on Monday
at 9:30 to continue proceedings.

510
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,892
Your Honor, please.

511
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,188
Since his injury, I have not had
a single conversation with Mr. Soprano...

512
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,857
...in which we've related
on any meaningful level.

513
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,026
Feel free to take that up on appeal.

514
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,036
Fuck!

515
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,706
We'll get to a juror.
We're working very hard.

516
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,768
Hello?

517
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,397
Bobby, hi. What's up?

518
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,275
I was just doing housework. Why?

519
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,570
Is everything all right?

520
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,948
Oh, my God.

521
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,540
Tell me about it.

522
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,752
Got home tonight.

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,255
Kids were kind of quiet.

524
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,882
Then bedtime, all hell broke loose.

525
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,426
Crying, wouldn't be left alone.

526
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,097
Sophia especially.

527
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,101
They've been playing with that
goddamn Ouija board again.

528
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,394
Oh, no.

529
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,438
They were trying to contact Karen.

530
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,567
What?

531
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,490
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

532
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,159
I came over this afternoon
with some pound cake.

533
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,619
I saw it.

534
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,789
I heard them in his room with
that Ouija board. I thought:

535
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,833
"This is not good."

536
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,795
But then, after the other night,
I didn't want to overstep my bounds.

537
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,132
It's my fault.

538
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,011
Hey. You're under a lot of stress.
You're a single dad.

539
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,097
No, you were right.

540
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,641
It's bad for them. It's unwholesome.

541
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,019
You want me to go up?

542
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,980
I think they're asleep. Finally.

543
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,108
I had to read to Sophia
for, like, an hour.

544
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,654
She couldn't even handle a Nancy Drew,
it was too mysterious.

545
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,616
- Go ahead.
- It's just...

546
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,037
...the dead have nothing
to say to us, Bobby.

547
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,833
It's our own narcissism
that makes us think they even care.

548
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,336
It does get better with time.

549
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,885
Did you get anything to eat at least?
Can I fix you something?

550
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,305
- No, it's too much trouble.
- No, it's not.

551
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,183
I'm starving too.

552
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,686
There's probably something in here.

553
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,909
Karen's ziti.

554
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,537
It's the last one she made.

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,051
And it was, like, 300 degrees
in that Minnie Mouse head.

556
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,887
So I took it off, you know?
I was gonna have a cigarette.

557
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,224
- And some kid took a picture of me...
- Come on, girls, girls.

558
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,686
These gentlemen have things
to discuss. Let's go.

559
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,438
Okay.

560
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,566
- Nice to meet you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.

561
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,944
See you guys after.

562
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,948
Look, Carmine.

563
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:15,328
You know what's going on with your dad
and Johnny and us over in Jersey.

564
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,623
First, let me say, I understand.

565
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,626
I appreciate the respect you're
showing me by coming here...

566
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,462
...and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.

567
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,466
And I will also say, I know my old man
can be a tough nut to crack.

568
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,428
I don't wanna crack nuts.
But I will.

569
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,598
- I feel the anger.
- When I try for the second time...

570
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:40,770
...on a separate issue entirely
to reach an accommodation...

571
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,940
...and he don't even make
a counteroffer, where's his respect?

572
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,484
I don't know what advice
he's getting from Johnny.

573
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,903
Johnny's always usually
a voice of moderation.

574
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,239
Me and him, we get along good.

575
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:55,160
So all due respect,
let's not jump in and blame Johnny.

576
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,121
True. John's a pragmatist.

577
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,748
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.

578
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,584
He lives above his head a little.

579
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:09,090
I am reminded of Louis the whatever's
finance minister, De-something.

580
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,844
He built a chateau. Nicole
and I saw it when we went to Paris.

581
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,973
It even outshone Versailles,
where the king lived.

582
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,311
In the end,
Louis clapped him in irons.

583
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,947
Look, Tony...

584
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,201
...all I can promise you
is I will look into it.

585
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,953
I understand you gotta try
to feel out your old man...

586
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,332
...so he don't give you a mazz.
You know, for sticking your nose in.

587
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,627
Tony, I haven't been afraid
of my father for quite some time.

588
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,005
Fair enough.

589
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,676
But, Carmine, bear in mind,
he came onto my turf.

590
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,179
He tried to recruit my melanzane.

591
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,974
And worse, he roughed up my appraiser.

592
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:05,146
If the proper response is not forthcoming
in a businesslike time frame...

593
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,360
...my next move will not be
further conversation.

594
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,653
I get it.

595
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,322
You should know my next call
will be to Johnny Sack.

596
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,201
To let him know that we talked.
He shouldn't feel blindsided.

597
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,627
Hello? Hello?

598
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,590
I'm here for the masoner job.

599
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,984
Me no...

600
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,362
...speak English.
