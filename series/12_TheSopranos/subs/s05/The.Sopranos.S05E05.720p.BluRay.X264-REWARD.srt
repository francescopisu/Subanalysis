1
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,541
- Dad.
- Hey.

2
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,044
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I got an office here.

3
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,714
- You come down with Finn?
- And some people.

4
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,176
Promise me, no drinking and driving.

5
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,887
Who's your designated driver?

6
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,557
I'm not the one with all
the dents in their car.

7
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,393
All right. Have fun, huh?

8
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,353
You need some money?

9
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,732
Have a good time, sweetheart.
Be careful.

10
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,119
- You see Meadow?
- Yeah. I wish I knew she was here.

11
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,746
- I wonder what the fuck she's thinking.
- I'm sorry, Ton.

12
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,666
Some kid had a seizure upstairs.
It's been a horrible night.

13
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,587
Hey, Ton, Vito and Gene just called.
They're five minutes away.

14
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,923
All right. We're leaving. Here.

15
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,343
All right, call them and tell them
to meet us at Bud's Butter Bun...

16
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,846
...on Broadway and 18th.
All right.

17
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,273
Did I just see your father?

18
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,567
He's got an office here.

19
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,611
Saturday night?

20
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,821
That's dedication.

21
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,866
The guy sure can put in the hours.

22
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,952
- Why not?
- Let's go someplace else.

23
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,623
Tony's spending so much time
at the club.

24
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,251
You think that might have
something to do with you?

25
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,924
If you think I'm gonna blow this guy for
your sick purposes, you are mistaken.

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,927
So go on about this phone call
the other night.

27
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,889
It was just some guy
with a Southern accent.

28
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,433
Christopher yelled at him
for calling the house.

29
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,478
- Said he'd see him down there.
- Down where?

30
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,188
Did you check the log on his cell?

31
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,067
Not since I almost got caught doing that,
and I am not doing it again.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:04:00,447
Wait till he goes into the shower.
See if there's a 404 or 336.

33
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,908
And memorize any other numbers
you don't recognize.

34
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,913
- What's the matter?
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

35
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,625
- I know, you said.
- No, I gotta go.

36
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,087
- Number two.
- I'll take you to your car.

37
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,340
No, I gotta go now. Oh, my God.

38
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,764
You okay? We're almost there.

39
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,015
Try to relax.

40
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,728
Don't you got a general anesthetic?
This lidocaine didn't do much.

41
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,564
And we are...

42
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,108
...done.

43
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,777
Jan, you wanna do your thing?

44
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,826
- Just keep a little pressure.
- All right.

45
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,954
I'm gonna get this down to the lab,
see what's what.

46
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,543
Okay. There we go.

47
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,879
- You okay?
- You think he got it all?

48
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,882
We hope so. Meantime,
there's a canteen on level L.

49
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,635
I'll let you know when
the results come back.

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,892
Does having a bowel movement
relieve the pain?

51
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,269
Yeah.

52
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,064
Would you describe the diarrhea
as loose or liquid?

53
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,735
Liquid. But this is getting so I'm afraid
to be away from the toilet.

54
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,404
I'm so scared
I'm gonna have an accident.

55
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,157
- Is this tender?
- No.

56
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,827
Sit up.

57
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,753
- How's your personal life?
- What do you mean?

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,256
Well, sometimes GI disturbances
are stress-related.

59
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,177
Is there anything unusual that
might be giving you the jim-jams?

60
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,767
I just want something for my stomach
so I can quit going to the bathroom.

61
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,769
That's what's giving me stress.

62
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,772
Why don't you get dressed.
We'll talk in my office.

63
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,529
I hear you're spending time
with today's youth.

64
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,740
You lost me.

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,868
Meadow said she saw you
at Adriana's club.

66
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,788
I gotta explain my business to you now?
After so many years?

67
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,042
- No, it's your life, Tony.
- Got that right.

68
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,628
What'd you do to your head?
Did you fall again?

69
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,632
Banged it on the medicine chest.
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,634
There's your allowance.

71
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,766
Well, that actually looks like fruit.

72
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,852
Yeah. It's so hard.

73
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,232
What do you do it for?

74
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,121
Irritable bowel syndrome?

75
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,331
He'll know more when
the tests come back.

76
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,168
- I still gotta bring him a stool sample.
- Jesus, please.

77
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,421
You yelled at me
to go to the doctor.

78
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,923
I gotta know every detail?

79
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,758
I could be really sick, Christopher.

80
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,594
Yeah, my Aunt Josephine
had colon cancer.

81
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,472
Her whole asshole rotted out.

82
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,308
I may have to go into therapy.

83
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,979
- Plus, they're gonna put me on Prozac.
- For diarrhea?

84
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,276
It's to help me cope and handle stress,
which is a lot of what causes it.

85
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,321
What do you got to be stressed about?
That bar?

86
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,493
War, Christopher. The Middle East.

87
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,537
You don't listen to the president?

88
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,165
We're gonna mop the floor
with the whole fucking world.

89
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,043
The world's gonna be under our control.
So, what are you worked up about?

90
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:01,480
Give me the Orioles over the Tigers for 2,
and the Jays over the Rangers, 3 G's.

91
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,406
- Just getting my day planner.
- No, I'm done.

92
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,751
My stupid car. Five thousand miles
and the alternator's going.

93
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,965
What about you?
Mimi said you went to the doctor.

94
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,426
I've been having trouble
with my stomach.

95
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,597
- That's why I'm drinking White Russians.
- What, you got ulcers already?

96
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,392
- It's called IBS.
- What's that?

97
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,940
Irritable bowel syndrome.

98
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,361
My mother had that all her life.

99
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,366
- You see this?
- Yeah, I noticed that. What happened?

100
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,201
- It's cancer.
- What?

101
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,913
- Yeah, squamous.
- Oh, my God, that's terrible.

102
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,374
Well, they think they got it all.
Knock wood.

103
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,753
Just, cancer, the things
that run through your head, you know?

104
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,588
Sure.

105
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,467
I got a top guy, though. Katz.

106
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,637
Hesh recommended him, naturally.

107
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,728
So this disease you got,
what causes it?

108
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,523
I did a Google on it,
and, like, the doctor too...

109
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,733
...they all say a lot
of it's psychological.

110
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,279
So on top of everything,
now I'm a headcase.

111
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:36,283
No. Come on. Stop blaming yourself.

112
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,162
Christopher don't wanna know.
Not that I blame him.

113
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,504
I gotta take off.

114
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,967
A.J. should be coming home
from his volleyball thing.

115
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,762
Listen, don't say anything
to anybody, okay?

116
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,932
People hear cancer,
they start to bury you already.

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,977
And you don't tell anybody
what I told you.

118
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,689
All right, take care of yourself.

119
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,526
- Say hi to Anthony.
- Yeah.

120
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,031
You're such a good father.
I wish my dad had been like that.

121
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,909
Night, dear.

122
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,663
It's a straight shot on I-95 to Raleigh.

123
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,750
You give this shit to the fence,
I'll meet you in Winston-Salem...

124
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,670
...we'll load up the cigs and come home.
If we're picking up so many cigarettes...

125
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,590
...why don't we, instead of two vans,
rent a deuce and a half?

126
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,216
And then share the driving?

127
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,136
Because the cops.
The van's under the radar.

128
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,307
- Erik Estrada over here.
- You forgot your folic acid.

129
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,851
What is all this stuff?

130
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,645
Beauty parlor chair?

131
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,230
If they even heard of electrolysis
down there.

132
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,400
- Where you going?
- Jesus Christ, go back to bed.

133
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,780
- What the fuck's your problem?
- My fucking tooth is killing me.

134
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,324
Well, you should go back
to the dentist.

135
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,910
Why do you have to go?
Can't they drop the stuff off?

136
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,746
Tony wants me to talk
to the guy down there.

137
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,165
The jerk you were yelling at
on the phone?

138
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,085
Is that the cigarette thing
you were talking about?

139
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,712
Six different kinds of dope
you get for a stomachache.

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,716
I got a fucking impaction, I can't take shit
besides oil of clove because I'm sober.

141
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,718
I know. It's hard. I'm sorry.

142
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,721
Have a nice trip. I love you.
Call me, okay?

143
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,265
She's got diarrhea.

144
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,822
- You want?
- Yeah, twist my arm.

145
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,453
I'm expecting some guys
from New York, so...

146
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,623
No problem. I got plenty to do out there.

147
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,255
- Who's this on?
- Oh, please. It's called the Lost Boys.

148
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,258
Sil's been ragging on me all week
for me to play them here.

149
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,760
Their manager or somebody
owes him money.

150
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,977
- So I thought this was your day off.
- Chrissy's away.

151
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,771
I don't like staying home alone.

152
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:17,318
Though at least I can pour a glass of wine
without him giving me the expression.

153
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,991
Yeah. Yeah, I know that look.
The constipated-owl look.

154
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,043
You know, when I first met you,
I was scared of you.

155
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,134
- Really?
- Yeah, but I'm scared of everybody.

156
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,845
It's always my first reaction.

157
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,099
Well, you're not scared of me now,
are you?

158
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,143
No.

159
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,357
Do we wanna shoot?

160
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,695
Make it interesting. Sawbuck a game.

161
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,507
No, it's the round thing
in the middle there.

162
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,928
How you feeling?
Everything all right in here now?

163
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,264
Don't... I know what you're doing.
Don't distract me.

164
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,392
Ohh

165
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,479
Ooohhh

166
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,565
I've been hustled.

167
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,907
- Did I get your toe?
- No. No, no, no.

168
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,159
I'm so sorry.

169
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,917
Come on, get up. Come on.

170
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,518
Shit. All right.

171
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,189
Wait.

172
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,901
Yeah.

173
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,699
- Tony here?
- Yeah, come on in.

174
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,285
Hey.

175
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,872
Let me know if you guys need anything.

176
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,292
You gonna tell me
about the traffic again?

177
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,295
Here, our friend sent this for you.

178
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,358
Thank you for taking the appointment.

179
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:51,032
And I know I'm on probation,
and I deeply regret...

180
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,201
...what I did.

181
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,967
My nephew's fiancée.

182
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,639
I know what you're thinking.

183
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,559
- So?
- Well, nothing happened.

184
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,729
But it could have, very easily.

185
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,067
I mean, she really got to me,
this young lady. She...

186
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,656
- What?
- This is a very big step.

187
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,533
Yeah, tell me about it.

188
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,244
I mean that you've come here
to talk about this impulse...

189
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,579
...instead of just acting on it
without thinking.

190
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,958
- No, I always think.
- Really?

191
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,004
- Yeah.
- Having sex with your mistress' cousin.

192
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,882
Like the mistress wasn't enough
to piss off your wife.

193
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,264
Tell me about the niece.

194
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,850
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

195
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,813
I mean, someone like her, I could...

196
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,402
Well, I could do it right this time.
I could start a whole new family.

197
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,031
I'm young enough.

198
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,492
Fuck them all.

199
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,204
And this is something
you're contemplating?

200
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:25,168
What? It'd be a disaster.
Of major proportions.

201
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,045
Carmela, I'd get hosed financially.

202
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,881
There'd be no reasoning with her
after that.

203
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,800
And my nephew, it would kill him.

204
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,387
After years of grooming him
to be my number two.

205
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,894
And it'd be very bad for the girl.
She doesn't deserve that.

206
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,523
I mean, I'm not stupid. I know part
of it's this father-figure thing, and...

207
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,068
You know, on account of hers ran off.

208
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,655
It would be like committing
an act of symbolic incest.

209
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,200
Whatever.

210
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,660
But what am I gonna do?

211
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,456
I got lucky the first time
because I was able to control myself.

212
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:08,836
- But you only get one of those.
- Rationalizing. "I can't control myself."

213
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,798
- You can.
- I don't know.

214
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,510
It's different for women.
It's all about up here with them.

215
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,428
She could make a play for you.

216
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:23,643
You might wanna think about how you're
going to establish limits and boundaries.

217
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,647
For example, you could tell her
she means a great deal to you...

218
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,857
...but you think of her as a daughter.

219
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,943
Even if I wanna fuck her brains out.

220
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,655
This is a milestone for you.

221
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,783
You're at a very important crossroads.

222
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,538
For once, you want to avoid
doing something you know is wrong...

223
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,373
...and would be destructive...

224
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,001
...both to yourself
and to the people you care about.

225
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,047
That's growth. That's progress.

226
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,385
- Just tell me what I'm supposed to do.
- You have to be honest with yourself.

227
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,887
I know this is a powerful urge.

228
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,975
But if you can't keep it in your pants,
you have to stay away from her.

229
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,151
You know...

230
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:21,742
...not long ago,
you stood in my outer office.

231
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,080
I recall you used the words
"drop-dead gorgeous" about me...

232
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,708
...and how you had to have me.

233
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,838
I said I wouldn't date you,
and look, you survived.

234
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,592
What a horrible fucking job you have.
How do you do it?

235
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,888
But what happens now is your choice.

236
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,724
Act, and create a bed of misery.

237
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,728
Or you can look at this as a chance
to do something good.

238
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,444
You say she respects you.
Be worthy of respect.

239
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,698
See if you can remain a friend
to this woman...

240
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,451
...a help to her.

241
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,212
You know, Tony had ducks one time.
In his pool.

242
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:20,885
- You need to find out where Chris went.
- I'm getting this vibe from him.

243
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,054
Who? Tony?

244
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,724
He's really nice. And he listens.

245
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,643
He's kind of attractive.

246
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,562
Definitely an alpha male.

247
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,982
- But what if Christopher found out?
- What?

248
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,320
- I'm not gonna fuck him.
- Then what are you talking about?

249
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,489
I love Christopher,
and sooner or later...

250
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,992
...we'll get out from under all this shit
and leave this fucking state.

251
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,328
Jesus Christ.

252
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,331
She's a good-looking woman
and she wants to fuck Barney Rubble?

253
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,001
Well, we really don't know him.
He listens.

254
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,174
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

255
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,686
- Tony, hi.
- Hey. How you doing?

256
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,021
Well, why I'm here,
Patsy's bringing somebody by.

257
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,357
I'm gonna need to use the office.

258
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,193
No problem. I made a resolution.

259
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,531
I gotta start spending a lot more time
on the floor. Crack the whip.

260
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,204
I'm beat, tell you the truth.

261
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,374
I think I'm gonna grab 40 winks
till Patsy gets here.

262
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,378
Wait, you don't have Chrissy's cell,
do you?

263
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,714
He called, but he didn't leave
a new number.

264
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,387
He'll probably try you again.
He's due back tomorrow.

265
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,495
- Excuse me. I'll come back.
- No, I'm all right.

266
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,250
Mole back there looked
irregular around the margins.

267
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,086
Every time I see anything now,
I think I got melanoma.

268
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,339
I can imagine.

269
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,720
Hi, it's Adriana at the Crazy Horse.

270
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,183
Yeah, I need a car, please.
Just tell him to wait outside.

271
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,230
- What, your car still?
- Yeah. They're replacing the alternator.

272
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,940
You want a belt?

273
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,902
What I could really use is some...

274
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,281
I wouldn't say no.

275
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,659
Get me motivated to clean the house
before Christopher gets back.

276
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,870
Except I'm all out.

277
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,626
It's 2:00. Cross-eyed Billy
probably left the Bing already.

278
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,545
I know a guy, Andre. He's always up.

279
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,548
Well, cancel the car. I'll give you a ride.

280
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,893
You know who thinks you're cute?

281
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,812
Is Marlene.

282
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,064
She's gotta be over 30, isn't she?

283
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,775
She's 31.

284
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,779
You know who you ought to
introduce me to is that friend of yours.

285
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,950
- Who?
- The one you brought over to the house.

286
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,995
Tall, kind of blondish-brownish hair.
Danielle from Whippany.

287
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,456
She's dead.

288
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,334
- What?
- Yeah.

289
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,754
She... She drowned on a picnic.

290
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,010
Well, I thought I picked up on
something between her and me.

291
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,679
I'm not trying to be conceited.

292
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,598
Tony!

293
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,802
I've reviewed your chart
and ruled out internal injuries...

294
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,596
...so you're free to go.

295
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,182
I'll have the nurse process
your discharge orders.

296
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,099
Whoa

297
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,685
This was a very bad accident.

298
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,021
I mean, are you sure you did
all the tests?

299
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,231
I can afford it.

300
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,400
I did the appropriate tests.

301
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,444
I hold a medical degree
from Johns Hopkins.

302
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,656
My grandma was the first black woman
licensed to practice medicine in Delaware.

303
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,575
All right, take it easy.

304
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,828
The young lady that I was with,
they said she was okay...

305
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,872
...but could I see her?

306
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,549
Ade.

307
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,762
- Hey.
- Hi.

308
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,308
They say you're gonna be fine, they just
wanna keep you here for observation.

309
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,936
You know, be on the safe side.

310
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,357
I don't even remember what happened.

311
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,779
There was a raccoon in the road.
I swerved.

312
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,035
- How's your car?
- Escalade?

313
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,788
It's totaled.

314
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,457
Probably saved our life.

315
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,419
Are you okay?

316
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,090
Yeah. They're gonna let me go.

317
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,634
I wanna go too.

318
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,221
Chrissy's coming home today.

319
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,809
We should probably talk about that.

320
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,151
Yeah. Right.

321
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,790
Dude, how you doing?

322
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,254
I hit the fucking mother lode.
Twenty G's of product a week.

323
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,506
Little Paulie's behind me
with the other half.

324
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,466
Fuck me.

325
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:38,429
20 percent of this load, they can stamp
the packs for the vending machines.

326
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,348
The rest, the cartons
can go straight to the bodegas...

327
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,601
...let them worry about the stamps.

328
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,187
I'm beat. I'm gonna hit
the fucking rack...

329
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,356
...have Ade cook me up
a nice carbonara...

330
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,861
What's the matter?

331
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,364
Adriana's in the hospital.
She was in an accident.

332
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,116
What? When?

333
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,285
Last night around 2:00.

334
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,038
Jesus Christ, what happened?
Is she all right?

335
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,332
She got banged up,
but she's gonna be okay.

336
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,835
The drinking and driving, I told her.
Where is she?

337
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,962
- Mount Mercy in Dover.
- Dover?

338
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,506
Apparently they swerved
to avoid a deer in the road.

339
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,718
- They?
- Her and Tony.

340
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,304
Tony? Soprano?

341
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,222
Uh-huh

342
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,142
- Is he all right?
- Not a scratch.

343
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,394
The fucking luck on this guy.

344
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,480
Yeah.

345
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,398
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dover.

346
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,777
Right, she's got an aunt
she's close to out there who's been sick.

347
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,488
She's friends with Tony's aunt.

348
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,452
All right, somebody take me
to get my car. I better get over there.

349
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,579
Fabio, put it up.

350
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,756
Thought I'd die in there
without a cigarette.

351
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,970
What, so you're just not gonna talk?

352
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,724
- I almost got killed, Christopher.
- I'm just curious.

353
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,602
What the fuck were you doing
in the middle of the night...

354
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,730
...in the middle of nowhere,
in a car with my uncle?

355
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,358
He was driving me home.

356
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,694
- Fucking Dover?
- We were talking.

357
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,780
We were going to get something to eat.

358
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,408
I get off of work,
I don't wanna go right home.

359
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,786
- You weren't even there.
- No, I was in a fucking ride-a-rent...

360
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,747
...busting my ass with a bunch
of rednecks, making a living...

361
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,916
...to buy you alcohol and coke...

362
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,752
...and all the other shit
you shovel into your mouth.

363
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,966
Two o'clock in the fucking morning?

364
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,387
- Don't fucking lie to me! I can't stand it.
- Nothing was going on, Christopher.

365
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,305
I should have made you walk home.

366
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,308
- I swear to God.
- You know how this looks?

367
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,979
Don't talk to me. Shut your mouth.

368
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,456
You wanted to see me?

369
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,000
- Adriana okay?
- She's fine.

370
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,170
People who don't clean up
after their pets.

371
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,924
Pop this in that basket for me, will you?

372
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,813
It was blind luck, that accident.

373
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,776
Cop told me he thought he was coming up
on a fatality when he saw the car.

374
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,572
I'd be thinking the same thing
if I were you.

375
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,282
But it's not true.

376
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,118
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,206
Her car was in the shop, I was driving
her home from work, that's all.

378
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,875
We were looking to get a burger.

379
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,711
- In Dover?
- What difference does it make?

380
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,214
You don't seem to give a shit
she almost died.

381
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,842
She could have been paralyzed
or scarred up.

382
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,344
And you got a puss on?

383
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,223
What were you doing out there
alone in a car with my fiancée?

384
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,434
We were talking about you,
you selfish prick.

385
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,062
How you were the best thing
that ever happened to her.

386
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,397
Oh, you don't think
this fucking devastates me?

387
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,527
Frankly, you scored so far over your head
when you got her, what do you expect?

388
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,988
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- She's a knockout.

389
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,532
A 10.

390
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,325
And look at you.

391
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,661
You're average, at best.

392
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,871
So you better reconcile yourself
with that...

393
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,249
...or you're gonna be paranoid
your whole life.

394
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,210
- Oh, so this is my fucking fault now?
- Nothing happened.

395
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,796
And I'm not gonna say it again.

396
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,257
You should've married that girl
two years ago.

397
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,552
Everybody knows you've been
the biggest fucking cooze hound around...

398
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,595
...the past four or five years.

399
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,099
Your midlife crisis.
You'd fuck a catcher's mitt.

400
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,939
On everything I hold sacred...

401
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,608
...on my children...

402
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,111
...there's nothing going on
between me and Adriana.

403
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,458
Tony walked away without a scratch.

404
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,421
But Adriana suffered a severe blow
to the head.

405
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,924
Adriana got caught
giving the big guy a blow job.

406
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:30,429
And when the paramedics found them,
she had his cock still in her mouth.

407
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:35,058
Statistics show that most single-car
fatalities are the result of guys...

408
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,394
...popping their load behind the wheel.

409
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,439
Apparently he came all over the sun visor.

410
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,443
Sanseverino.

411
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,738
Guess who went down
on Tony Soprano?

412
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,158
That's the truth. It's fact.

413
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,202
If it was my old lady,
the next thing she'd suck is a tailpipe.

414
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,331
That pretty little trim can suck this pipe
anytime she wants.

415
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,792
- Like you'd ever have a shot.
- Hey, let me tell you something.

416
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,671
When Christopher was in rehab,
she was calling me all the time.

417
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,965
- I was this close.
- Then you got a problem...

418
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,010
...because your braciole
isn't even that long.

419
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,643
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

420
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,687
Didn't sound like nothing.
I wanna hear the big joke.

421
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,981
Take it easy.
We're just shooting the shit.

422
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,777
- We were just talking about my braciole.
- Oh, yeah, what about it?

423
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,031
- So deal you in, huh?
- I asked him a fucking question.

424
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,035
- What are you breaking my balls for?
- I want a fucking answer.

425
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,704
What's so fucking hilarious,
you fucking parade float?

426
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,542
I'm a fucking captain now.
You don't talk to me like that.

427
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,379
- Oh, come on, guys.
- Don't put your hands on me!

428
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,173
- Chrissy, for chrissakes...
- Fuck all of you.

429
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,633
- Hey, hey!
- Motherfucker!

430
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,885
- Hey, hold it.
- Vito, easy.

431
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,809
Vina, Jimmy, please join me.

432
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,396
So talk to me, guys.
How are we feeling in these?

433
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,439
Hey, hon. I already ate.

434
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,694
- There's a casserole in the...
- You fucking lying bitch!

435
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,947
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- You were sucking his cock!

436
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,323
Georgie told me everything.

437
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,576
The surgeon on the operating table
said you were moaning Tony's name.

438
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,830
- What are you talking about?
- Fucking lie to me!

439
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,708
What were you doing in Dover then?
See? See?

440
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,252
You can't tell me
because I know what you were doing.

441
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,421
Your other dope dealer's there.
I remembered.

442
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,339
- Go ahead. Deny it.
- Okay.

443
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,093
I was going out to see Andre,
but I wasn't sucking anybody's cock.

444
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,678
How could you say that?

445
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,389
So you two were just gonna go
toot up a bunch of lines...

446
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,933
...go fucking birdwatching?
Oh, you son of a bitch.

447
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,603
I was gonna stay up all night
and clean this fucking shithole.

448
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,690
Everybody knows about it.
Everybody's talking about it.

449
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,694
- No, please.
- You want me to use, you bitch.

450
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,614
- You're fucking killing me.
- No, I don't. I love you.

451
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,243
Stop it.

452
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,581
- You motherfucker!
- Fucking whore.

453
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,960
My neck!

454
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,504
Get the fuck out of here.

455
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,631
I never wanna see you again.

456
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,627
- Thought you had an algebra test.
- Oh, chill out.

457
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,670
What did you say?

458
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,133
Look, I studied for 45 minutes straight.
Don't I get a break?

459
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,431
Hey, what's up?

460
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,767
A.J., how's it going?

461
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,685
Hey, Uncle Tony.

462
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,981
Did I come at a bad time?
I need to talk to you.

463
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,528
A.J., go upstairs, study.

464
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,447
- Well, what about the pizza?
- Now.

465
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,037
Study.

466
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,423
All right, what's up?

467
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,592
I went to the Belleville Tavern
after work...

468
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,179
...and Larry down there said our little
cousin was in there all fucked up.

469
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,473
Somebody told him
what was going on in the car.

470
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,686
- There was nothing going on in the car.
- Of course not, but he thinks there was.

471
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,980
He started drinking again,
he beat up Adriana...

472
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,149
...and he threw her
out of the fucking house.

473
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,651
Where's his fucking self-control,
this guy?

474
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,487
Little Paulie's out there looking for him
to reign him in.

475
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,656
He was saying some crazy things
about you.

476
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,827
Oh, this goddamn kid.

477
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,079
Christopher's not right
in the head, Ton.

478
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,915
I mean, who the fuck knows
what he's capable of.

479
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,084
Well, he knows where to find me.

480
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,670
You see him, you tell him that.

481
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,798
Gotta use your john.

482
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,435
Get you a day early, huh?
I'll go to the store in the morning.

483
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,354
Look, relax. Go whenever you want.

484
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,948
What the hell is wrong with him?

485
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,993
What do you want, Tony?
He couldn't bring this in himself?

486
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,953
What, I can't even come in
and say hello?

487
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,373
What you want is to know if I heard
the disgusting shit they're saying.

488
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,542
At least have the guts
to come out and ask me.

489
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,212
- It isn't true.
- You know what, fuck you.

490
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,963
Fuck me? Fuck you.

491
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,217
You gotta put your son in hiding
because of your fucking philandering?

492
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,053
Afraid he'll get caught in the crossfire?
Your own son?

493
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,180
Christopher's upset.
He could come over.

494
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,141
He could say some things
that a kid shouldn't hear.

495
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,477
Just please leave.

496
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,979
I don't even wanna look at you.

497
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,942
Motherfucker!

498
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,208
Motherfucking gun!

499
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,715
Give me two.

500
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,051
This kid ain't gonna show up, T.
He's probably in some gutter.

501
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,345
Yeah, hopefully he's wore himself down.

502
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,307
- Where are you, you fuck?
- He's got a gun.

503
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,852
I know you're up there, you motherfucker!
Why don't you come out...?

504
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,022
- You know what to do.
- You're fucking lucky!

505
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,150
You're fucking lucky I ran out of load.

506
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,069
Shut up, you little cock,
or I'll split your fucking wishbone.

507
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,198
It's all over, everybody.
Enjoy the evening.

508
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,617
Unhappy customer.

509
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,106
Let me the fuck go!
I'll kill all of youse!

510
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,525
Fucking kill all of youse!

511
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,492
You draw down on the boss
of a fucking family?

512
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,954
You lied to me!
You were scoring coke with her.

513
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,832
- She admitted it.
- So what?

514
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,378
I can't relieve stress once in a while?
I don't got enough fucking problems?

515
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,423
You sent me to North Carolina
so you could fuck my girlfriend.

516
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,386
What kind of fucking animal
you think I am, huh?

517
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,765
- The thought never even entered my head!
- You're a man alone in a car with her.

518
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,268
You fucking pushed me to this.
You pushed me to this!

519
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,570
Way I see it, Tony, he must have
known the gun was empty.

520
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,322
Look what he pumped into your car.

521
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,868
What are you trying to say, Paulie?
The fuck you trying to say, Paulie?

522
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,920
Either you tell me right now...

523
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:28,049
...that you can take it into your heart
that I did not do this shit...

524
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,012
...or this is as far as we go.

525
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,606
- Motherfucker.
- Tony, come on.

526
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,484
- Listen to somebody else for a change.
- Fuck him.

527
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,779
Tony, try it my way.

528
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,865
Listen to me.

529
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,018
Mr. Soriano,
what seems to be the matter?

530
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,896
Soprano. I'm fine. It's my friend here
needs to talk to you.

531
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,814
Well, you know where ER admitting is.

532
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,817
Look, you got someplace
maybe we could talk?

533
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,071
It's 3 a.m., and I just finished
a 17-hour rotation.

534
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,158
Any gunshot wounds
or broken kneecaps?

535
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,748
Two minutes.
You're an excellent doctor.

536
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,959
That's why I brought him here.
Come on.

537
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,973
This gentleman here is the fiancé
of the young lady that I was with.

538
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,100
Now he's got it into his head...

539
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,978
...that there was oral sex going on
at the time of the wreck.

540
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,731
- Listen, I...
- Hey, hey, hey.

541
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,360
Just a second.

542
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,613
And naturally he's very upset.

543
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,115
So I need you to tell him there wasn't.

544
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,036
He's obviously feeling the pressure.
He's just gonna fucking lie.

545
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,832
I'm not in the custom of lying
about anything.

546
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,129
But whether somebody was getting
something in the car...

547
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,923
...how could I attest to that?

548
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,468
Well, as the attending, you could explain
how medically it's not possible.

549
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,470
- Excuse me?
- Well, for instance...

550
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,640
...if she was wearing a seat belt,
there would've been abrasions...

551
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,309
...to the lateral anterior aspect
of the clavicle.

552
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,270
Or the right mid-sternum?

553
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,646
Are you a physician?

554
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,733
No, I'm a pre-board-certified
massage therapist.

555
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,821
So did she have
any of those kind of things?

556
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,281
Actually, yes.

557
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,702
On the right clavicle and the sternum,
just above the xiphoid process...

558
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,247
...which would indicate an upright
position at the moment of impact.

559
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,916
Okay, so, what he's saying
is that she was sitting up.

560
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,715
All right. Thank you, doctor. Come on.

561
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,679
For the kids, Make-A-Wish Foundation,
whatever. Here.

562
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,182
Thank you.

563
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,188
What do you want from me?

564
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,149
I guess I believe you.

565
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,360
All right.

566
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,491
You threw food at Vito.
That's gotta be resolved.

567
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,536
He was fucking laughing,
which was wrong.

568
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,502
But at this point now,
it don't make no difference.

569
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:58,009
Even if it wasn't true,
it's what people think.

570
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,720
They know you were out there
scoring coke with her.

571
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,182
What do you care what people think?
You know the truth.

572
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,060
I gotta live in the world.

573
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,229
And now I look like Joe Jerkoff.

574
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,987
No, no, no, no.

575
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,083
You know what?
I might as well have fucked her.

576
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,876
Thanks.

577
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,176
Hello?

578
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,517
I rang the doorbell six times.
Nobody answered.

579
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,770
- What are you doing here?
- I wanna talk to you.

580
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:55,608
- If you came to get him, he's not going.
- You believe all that shit they're saying?

581
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,319
Am I that horrible? Really?

582
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,115
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
I don't know what you did.

583
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,702
What'll happen when your children
hear this? Meadow already suspects you.

584
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,787
- Suspects what?
- She saw you at the club.

585
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,789
She said she thought you were coked out.

586
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,958
What are you talking about?
I don't do drugs.

587
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,086
She knows about the accident.
What do you think she's gonna think?

588
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,172
- And with Anthony at that age?
- Oh, come on, the kids.

589
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,800
- The kids. It's about you.
- Fine. So it's all about me.

590
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,760
What, do I mean nothing to you?

591
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,139
That I gotta live with this
swirling around me?

592
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,059
All right, look, forget about
what they're saying. I'm asking you.

593
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,228
You think I'd have sexual relations
with her?

594
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,148
Adriana, who's gonna be
a member of this family?

595
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,778
Now, I want you to answer me truthfully.

596
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,199
Look, I know I haven't been
a fucking saint, all right...

597
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,703
...and you got plenty of issues
of your own on that subject...

598
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,415
...but you haven't exactly been
a fucking saint yourself.

599
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,671
No. No, no, no. Come here.

600
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,303
You think I would go near
that girl like that?

601
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,608
Thank you.

602
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,575
Look, I'm asking you to pull with me
to put a good face on this thing.

603
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,286
For the sake of the kids and this family.

604
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,789
I gotta bail you out?

605
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,876
It's never-ending, your bullshit.

606
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,189
Use a fucking crosswalk!

607
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,285
Jesus Christ.

608
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,371
Don't get all excited.

609
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,249
Most of it's from the accident.

610
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,251
You okay?

611
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,586
What do you fucking think?

612
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:25,424
I'm kicked out of my house, I may have
ulcerative colitis, and you call me up.

613
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,720
We'd like your permission to put
a listening device in your business.

614
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,807
This relationship with Tony
could net us a lot of chatter.

615
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,978
- Don't forget, it's him we're after.
- There is no relationship.

616
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:41,440
The faster we put Tony away,
the sooner you can get on with your life.

617
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,611
We can get a court order to install
a device, but this will make life simpler.

618
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,824
Fuck you. I do enough for you people.

619
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:53,077
- You're not bugging my club.
- Adriana...

620
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,415
...it's a syndrome, protecting abusers.

621
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,587
If it would've been Christopher
alone in a car with a woman...

622
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,714
...I would've killed him.

623
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,642
Thank you.

624
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,999
Arthur's sending something over,
with his compliments.

625
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,667
Thank you.

626
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,679
Enjoy.

627
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,687
I'm gonna go over there.

628
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,448
- Nice to see you, Ton.
- Oh, thank you.

629
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,243
Gravy's good tonight.

630
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,422
Nice to see you.

631
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,841
Hope you have a pleasant evening.

632
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,977
Ladies.
