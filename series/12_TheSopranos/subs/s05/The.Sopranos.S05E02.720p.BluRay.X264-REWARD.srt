1
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,466
There he is.

2
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,968
Black Jack Massarone.

3
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,556
I saw this, and I thought of you.

4
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,686
- Look at that.
- The guy's local.

5
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,356
He makes them as part of a program
for disabled vets.

6
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,823
A little gift to show my gratitude
for all our work together.

7
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,741
Thanks.

8
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,079
Look at those guys, huh?

9
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,166
They had some times, huh?

10
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,129
We're finally gonna cut the ribbon
for the museum on the 22nd.

11
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,215
They even asked me to make
a little speech on the challenges...

12
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,342
...of contemporary urban development.

13
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,053
Thank you.

14
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,805
Something for you?

15
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,641
I'll have what he's having.

16
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,982
Listen, my buddy in City Plan Check
says they just pulled a permit...

17
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,068
...to turn the old bus station
into a mixed-use.

18
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,070
Zellman still hasn't given me a number.

19
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,823
Has he said anything to you
about another bid?

20
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,659
Oh, we don't talk much.

21
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,494
Take your hat off. Relax.

22
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,415
Yeah. I just started on the Rogaine.

23
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,172
Listen, you think you could ask Ron
if this falls under the same arrangement?

24
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,258
It's kind of soggy,
you wanna know the truth.

25
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,177
Tony, this is federal redevelopment.

26
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,013
I'll look into it.

27
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,144
- So a speech, huh?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,064
At the Museum of Science and Trucking.

29
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,442
I just wish my mother could have seen it.

30
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,279
Well, wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

31
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:04,201
Actually, I think I know exactly
where she is, and it's pretty fucking hot.

32
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,286
You had one of those too, huh?

33
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,583
Gentlemen.

34
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,669
Is everything okay here?

35
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,088
Yeah, sure. Just talking.

36
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,051
Okay, then. Have a good night.

37
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,148
So they go through labor, big deal.
Try a prostate exam.

38
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,654
This is great.

39
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,782
And I usually don't like modern art.

40
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,537
The Rat Pack.

41
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,749
Do you know a Joseph "Joey" Cogo?

42
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,170
Not much. I mean, I met him.

43
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,507
Last week.

44
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,011
Me and Chrissy were having dinner
with Tony and his friend, Valentina.

45
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,471
Joey Cogo sent over a bottle of Veuve.

46
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,224
You wanna show her those?

47
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,731
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,359
Was this man with him?

49
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,366
Yeah, I saw him.

50
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,035
You're sure?

51
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,203
Tuesday night.

52
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,386
Jesus, because of what I said?

53
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,393
You're supposed to be earners. That's...
The top-tier positions.

54
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,688
So each of you, go to your people
on the street. Crack some fucking...

55
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,732
Create some fucking earners out there!

56
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,650
So, what's he saying?

57
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,694
The way I remember, he said:

58
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,698
"That's why you got
the top-tier positions."

59
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:12,120
This other inaudible
is "crack fucking heads," not "legs."

60
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,748
I need a signature.

61
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,423
Now, that's it. That's all I gotta say.

62
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,592
Frankly, I'm depressed and...

63
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,554
- Depressed and what?
- Depressed and ashamed.

64
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,392
So, what about my Alan Stuart shirt
from that meeting?

65
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,853
Ralph Cifaretto spilt my coffee
and ruined it.

66
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,482
I can petty cash it. Resubmit, okay?

67
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,408
This Crazy Horse pole camera's
working out really good.

68
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,452
Paulie Gualtieri's car again.
She's still lying.

69
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,918
Listen, any chance
you could

70
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,421
ask Ron if this falls
under the same arrangement?

71
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,631
It's kind of soggy,
you wanna know the truth.

72
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,009
- Pie. He was eating.
- Tony, this is federal redevelopment.

73
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,011
I'll look into it.

74
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,143
- So a speech, huh?
- Sound quality is amazing.

75
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,145
New hats. Mike's right in the button.

76
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,648
- Museum of Science and Trucking.
- Just wish my mother could have seen it.

77
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,650
Give it to Angela and shut the door.

78
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,986
Well, wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

79
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,614
What happened to the jury-tampering
investigation on Junior Soprano's trial?

80
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,742
- Actually, I...
- You guys just drop the ball on that?

81
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,494
Massarone's a huge asset.

82
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,831
- Couple him with...
- What, three-year-old airline tickets?

83
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,916
Some ties to the Bevilaqua murder?

84
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,504
Even if Massarone
and a thousand other snitches pan out...

85
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,923
...we've still gotta put Tony on trial.

86
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,717
That's useless until we find out...

87
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,428
...how they penetrated
the anonymous jury system.

88
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,346
And what?
Jury duty's not tough enough?

89
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,432
We don't like to dig into some citizen.

90
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,685
Tough shit.
One of those citizens is a felon.

91
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,687
Get on it.

92
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,319
You know what's going on here, right?

93
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,655
He fucked up his six-figure future
with O'Melveny and Myers...

94
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,033
...when he blew the Junior Soprano trial.

95
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,204
Of course, he'll keep trying him
until he fixes that.

96
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,541
- Hey!
- Hey.

97
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,753
There he is, John Barrymore.

98
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,215
- How are you?
- All right.

99
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,928
I thought nobody ever comes to see you.

100
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,096
I was dropping off some dandelions.

101
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,350
Saw a beautiful patch
in a vacant lot over by 15th Street.

102
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,852
- Nice salad.
- Any word about Tony B?

103
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,812
Yeah, yeah, should be any day now.

104
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,232
Aunt Quintina's gonna call
the moment she hears.

105
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,652
- He's a good kid, your cousin? Smart.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,238
Fucking weirdo, you ask me.

107
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,908
All right, the vacant
lot over on 15th Street?

108
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,827
That's where all the neighborhood dogs
go to piss.

109
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,665
You goddamn clown.

110
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,086
So, you got anything lined up
for the kid?

111
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,047
Yeah, yeah, air bags.
We pull them from boosted cars.

112
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,091
People buy them
like you wouldn't believe.

113
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,054
Hey, legit dealers, body shops,
they reinstall undeployed bags as new.

114
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,723
- Top dollar.
- Brave, new world.

115
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,269
Jesus Christ, they didn't even
have shoulder belts when I went away.

116
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,271
You'll let me know
when the kid gets out?

117
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,107
Yeah, we'll have a party for him.
All right.

118
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,567
I love you, okay.

119
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,622
Come on, eat. Don't be so sensitive.

120
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,584
I was being polite.
It's like eating red fescue.

121
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,795
I'll take an egg. You want an egg?
Bobby, make my nephew an egg.

122
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,630
I don't want an egg.

123
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,303
Tony B.

124
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,763
A little welcome-home present.

125
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,641
- What's that, a Motorola?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,059
Supposed to be the best.

127
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,813
So, I figured he could use one.
Call me when he needs me.

128
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,649
All the fellas are getting out, huh?

129
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:15,071
The class of 2004.
Old rats on a new ship.

130
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,576
Think I'll take an egg.
Make us a couple eggs.

131
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,579
I'm doing it. You told me.
He don't want one.

132
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,416
You and Tony Egg again.

133
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,501
Tony Egg? Tony B.

134
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,129
Like the time you two...
You took that camera in the bathroom...

135
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,174
...at your sister Barbara's confirmation.

136
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,262
Hello.

137
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,932
Oh, that's terrible.

138
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,603
Where's he gonna be laid out?

139
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,148
Who now? Goddamn it.

140
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,525
Well, let us know.

141
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,528
Carmine Lupertazzi.

142
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,739
He passed during the night.

143
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,700
What a fucking blow.

144
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,869
He was a great man.

145
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,706
My cousin told me it was Carmine
who invented point-shaving.

146
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,919
CCNY versus Kentucky, 1951.

147
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,714
Nobody beat the spread.
I bought a black Fleetwood.

148
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,515
Anthony. Anthony, did I ever tell you
I want to be cremated?

149
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,141
About four times.

150
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,853
And don't throw my ashes in somebody's
yard or off some fucking bridge.

151
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,398
I wanna be on a mantelpiece
surrounded by family.

152
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,442
Yeah, under the moose head. I know.

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,070
Keep joking. Let me tell you something.

154
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,322
It's like that game
we used to play as kids.

155
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,783
Crack The Whip.

156
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,244
You run around holding hands
as tight as you can...

157
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,164
...and then the line snaps,
somebody lets go...

158
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,999
...and you're next.

159
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,267
Your father meant a lot to all of us,
and not just financially either.

160
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,437
- How are you?
- Looking good.

161
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,021
- Yeah, there you go.
- Fantastic.

162
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,398
What's up, buddy?

163
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,400
- John.
- Gene.

164
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,528
Nicole.

165
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,781
- You remember Mr. Petrille.
- What, honey?

166
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,660
- He meant a lot to us.
- Tough going, right?

167
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,204
Ginny, Phil, how are you doing?

168
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,956
- Hey, kid.
- Angelo.

169
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,875
I'm heartbroken.

170
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,963
- Nicole, you remember Mr. Garepe.
- Of course.

171
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,593
That was my aunt. My cousin's out.

172
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,138
- That's great news.
- Start him off small, T.

173
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,766
You hear that? Your cousin's out.

174
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,060
- Oh, look who's coming.
- What?

175
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,107
- Hey there, handsome.
- Hey, baby.

176
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,318
- How are you?
- Good.

177
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,653
Lorraine, you're looking good.

178
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,989
Yeah, keeping it together
with Pilates and gin.

179
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,949
Sil, Paulie, how is it hanging?

180
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,743
Still got the nice manners, huh?

181
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,747
This is my nephew, Christopher.

182
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,334
Lady shylock, you got some reputation.

183
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,294
Yeah, my mother
said that might happen.

184
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,340
I'd like to introduce you the love of my
life. This is my partner, Jason Evanina.

185
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,510
- Honor to meet you.
- Hi, how are you?

186
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:28,223
So, Jesus leans off the cross
and whispers to Peter:

187
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,308
"I can see your house from here."

188
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,692
I'm so sorry. This was such a shock.

189
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,197
This is a very hard day.

190
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,200
I just saw Ginny.
The flowers are beautiful.

191
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,078
- John, got a minute?
- Yeah.

192
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,540
Nicole, I'm sorry.

193
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,502
What's going on here?

194
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,129
- What're you talking about?
- My father.

195
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,715
- Look at his hands.
- He looks peaceful.

196
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,594
I'm talking about his rosary. The medal?

197
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,889
You think I don't know what that is?
It's for Opus Dei.

198
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,891
What the fuck is that about?

199
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,812
In his later years, your father
was very sensitive about the church.

200
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,523
Bullshit. Your wife is into Opus Dei.

201
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,317
- You told Colombino to put it there.
- You sure about that?

202
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,778
- Yes, I'm sure about that.
- Body's not even cold.

203
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,573
No respect for anything anymore.

204
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,160
In New Jersey housewife,
fundamentalist shit? I doubt it, John.

205
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,456
You yourself said,
I was like another son to him.

206
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,543
I was being polite. It was his deathbed.

207
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,545
I should have written those words down.

208
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,214
You should have.
They don't mean anything anymore.

209
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,300
You understand what I'm saying?

210
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,642
I saw a huge mushroom cloud...

211
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,145
Edward "Babe" Heffron

212
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,022
...from the shell.

213
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,401
Jim Campbell might be alive today...

214
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,987
...if he hadn't have said to me:

215
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:11,117
"Heffron, you stay here with your gun.

216
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,494
I'm going up."

217
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,459
All your life...

218
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,963
...you gotta remember what one guy did
because he thought it was his job to do.

219
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,342
And he took a shot for you.

220
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,311
This shit's not supposed to run,
and here I look like a raccoon.

221
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,314
You are irresistible, and you know it.

222
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,399
Danny said I was clingy.

223
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,444
Fuck him. He's the one
with the self-esteem issues.

224
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,031
You don't know what it's like out there,
Ade. You're marrying Christopher.

225
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,452
He's handsome, makes money.
He's got great hair. He...

226
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,709
Okay.

227
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,379
You know I love animals,
but this thing is so gorgeous.

228
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,340
Isn't it? My dad almost had a stroke.

229
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,010
But I told him, "Hey, asshole, I'm the
one taking all the fucking risk here."

230
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,972
I have to fake the invoices.

231
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,475
Sometimes you gotta just take care
of yourself, you know?

232
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,851
Sure you do, honey.

233
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,230
Come here.

234
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,527
Come on.
Let's don't keep your date waiting.

235
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,779
He likes you, I can tell.

236
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,204
We got a white wine for Ade.

237
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,290
That's another apple martini for you.

238
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,793
- Thank you, my dear.
- My 7 and 7.

239
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,462
And a nothing and nothing.

240
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,507
Don't listen to him, Chrissy.

241
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,384
I think what you're doing's brave.

242
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,761
It's not for everybody...

243
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,639
...but things are different
when you don't have that crutch.

244
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,392
We make up for it other ways.

245
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,562
My God, it's hot in here.

246
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,981
What do you expect?
You're dancing in a mink coat.

247
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,316
It's fox.

248
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,235
She's my fox in a fox.

249
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,739
Let's see her box.
Or maybe her socks.

250
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,034
Stupid.

251
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,497
Well, I have to wear fur on the outside on
account of being bare everywhere else.

252
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,709
- You believe this one?
- No shit.

253
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:35,261
Every place I go, I got substances
I can't enjoy shoved in my face.

254
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,931
But I guess asking you for a little
support system in my own home...

255
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,600
...is way the fuck out of line.

256
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,643
You gotta have some more wine.

257
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,437
Seemed to have a good time tonight.

258
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,522
What the fuck you talking about?

259
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,940
What, Tina?

260
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,944
Come on, that cunt's
too full of herself anyway.

261
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,530
Cunt? She's my maid of honor,
Christopher.

262
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,908
She's no fucking maid, let me tell you.

263
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,124
Great, now I'm upset.
See what I'm talking about?

264
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,794
But I guess it's all my problem.

265
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,549
I'm sorry, baby.

266
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,051
Okay?

267
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,637
Jeez!

268
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,972
Please, stop.

269
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,186
Well, there you are.
My handsome nephew.

270
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,148
Auntie Quin, look at you.
All dolled up, huh?

271
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,570
- I never thought I'd live to see this day.
- Well, here you are. Still here.

272
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,197
- Where's Tony?
- Downstairs...

273
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,366
...getting into one of his old suits.

274
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,244
- I'll buy him some new suits.
- He's fine.

275
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,664
I only wish
he had more to come back to.

276
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,375
That ex-wife of his...

277
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,170
...she uses her answering machine
to ignore me...

278
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,673
...so forget about us seeing the twins.

279
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,803
How's Kelly? How's she doing?

280
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, she's lost to us, Anthony.

281
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,518
But Tony says he's gonna
hire a detective.

282
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,353
Look at this.

283
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,355
Two of you were so cute.

284
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,276
Well, even then my cannoli
was bigger than his.

285
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,027
Oh, stop.

286
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,366
Oh, man, there he is.

287
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,253
God, Ton.

288
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,839
Look at us, 15 fucking years.

289
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,966
The language.

290
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,178
Go ahead, say it.
I haven't changed a bit, right?

291
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,432
You look good. You look good.

292
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,644
Say provolone.

293
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,399
Surprise!

294
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,901
Oh, shit.

295
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,945
Very nice, you give me a heart attack.

296
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,156
Ma, it's enough, all right?

297
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,742
Stop crying. I'm embarrassed enough.

298
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,579
I don't know what to say.

299
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,581
Don't say anything. Just eat, huh?

300
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,875
Oh, hey.

301
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,711
I got peppers been marinating
for 15 years!

302
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,924
- Hey.
- What?

303
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,425
Where's tubbs?

304
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,261
Artie, what happened here?

305
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,722
Still a ball-breaker, huh?

306
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,856
What the fuck's with him?

307
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,733
Ask him.

308
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,693
You guys have a beef?

309
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,324
I loaned the guy money, then he tried to
kill himself. Guess who got the blame.

310
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,869
Oh, my God, Ton.

311
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,039
My God,
we have all missed you so much.

312
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,291
I swear, you look exactly the same.

313
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,085
You're still full of shit, huh?

314
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,880
Is Nancy here yet? The twins?

315
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,465
No, Nancy couldn't make it.

316
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,467
Her aunt in Bayonne, the sciatica...

317
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,936
- What are you gonna do?
- Cousin!

318
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,146
Jan. Oh, Christ.

319
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,982
Come, I want you to meet my family.

320
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,817
I'm talking to him right now.

321
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,360
Tony, you remember Bobby.

322
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,321
- Good to see you. Welcome home.
- Now my husband.

323
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,157
And guys,
this is your Uncle Tony Blundetto.

324
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,742
Hey there.

325
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,328
How come we never met you before?

326
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,581
I've been away on business.

327
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,166
I never even heard of you.

328
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,754
Stop playing with your ice. Come on.

329
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,883
They let that kid say anything.

330
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,011
Welcome home, Uncle Tony.

331
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,179
Oh, Jesus.

332
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,597
This is Meadow.

333
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,685
God, you turned out beautiful, honey.

334
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,522
And this strapping, young man
is Anthony Jr.

335
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,524
How's Kelly?

336
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,861
Our regular dinner up by you Thursday?

337
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,696
Yes, Daddy.

338
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,033
See, with my family now,
you know, in separation...

339
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,286
...you gotta make an appointment
to see each other.

340
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,834
- I should go see Uncle Zio.
- Yeah.

341
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,711
- All right.
- Show him the phone.

342
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,212
Yeah.

343
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,659
Tony.

344
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,121
I'll make this fast
because I know you're all hungry.

345
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,585
I remember, growing up,
I was always asking...

346
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,421
...why I just used to have sisters.

347
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,091
I said to my mother,
"Can't you save up something and...

348
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,884
...then get me a baby brother?"

349
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,264
And my mother said,
"What's wrong with your cousin Tony?"

350
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,352
And she was right
because we were brothers.

351
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,605
Except, you know,
we had the same name.

352
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,608
There was like 50 Tonys in the family.

353
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,820
Some of you remember this.

354
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,698
My dad's name was Johnny and...

355
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,200
...his dad's name was Alfred.

356
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,703
And so whenever we were out
running around, and we'd hear:

357
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,790
"Tony Uncle Johnny," that was for me...

358
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,085
...and "Tony Uncle Al,"
that was for him.

359
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,462
And there was "Tony Uncle Philly."
Remember?

360
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,256
- Right, yeah.
- But...

361
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,260
...he passed away, buon anima.

362
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:54,306
And Uncle Phil... Uncle Phil,
he passed away a long time ago too.

363
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,144
So anyway...

364
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,398
...Tony's being away...

365
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,233
...it's been hard.

366
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,069
But he's back now...

367
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,571
...for good.

368
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,828
So welcome home.

369
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,872
Welcome home.

370
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,165
Thank you.

371
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,501
Come on, let me hear it.
Welcome home!

372
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,463
Welcome home!

373
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,509
Hey, Ton, Meadow is incredible.
She's a fucking Ivy Leaguer.

374
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,387
- You and Carm hit a home run.
- Yeah.

375
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,182
I'm sure Kelly's all right,
wherever she is.

376
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,060
- Hey, her old man was in prison.
- We tried to do everything we could.

377
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,146
I know, I wasn't around.
What can I expect?

378
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,733
I mean, if things had gone
different way back when, who knows?

379
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,904
What do you want from me?

380
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,824
Nothing. I'm just saying,
it's good it wasn't both of us.

381
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,621
Well, these things happen, right?

382
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,541
You're gonna like this place. This is nice.

383
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,211
This is the kind of place
we always talked about having.

384
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,385
Fucking weird.

385
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,346
My cousin in the old man's seat.

386
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,264
It's like Sun Tzu says:

387
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,393
"A good commander is benevolent
and unconcerned with fame."

388
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,895
What?

389
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,065
Sun Tzu,
the Chinese Prince Machiavelli.

390
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,692
Tony turned me on to him.

391
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,777
"Tzu, Tzu."

392
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,239
"Sun Tzu," you fucking ass-kiss.

393
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,074
Hey.

394
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,742
Feech.

395
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,912
You know, I missed you by two weeks
at Allenwood.

396
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,842
This'll help you get started.

397
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,636
Jesus, you're on your feet already?

398
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,764
You hit the ground running,
and you don't look back, huh?

399
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,391
Thank you.

400
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,851
Come on.

401
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,897
So you in on the bus-station project?

402
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,941
Massarone's waiting on a number.

403
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,277
- How's he doing?
- Good.

404
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,153
We had coffee.

405
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,990
He used to bore me, Jack.

406
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,158
He ain't a bad guy
once you get to know him.

407
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,202
I always liked him.

408
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:28,252
I was very touched
by that funeral the other day.

409
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,963
- Real heart-grabber.
- That fucking little Carmine.

410
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,464
And after what?

411
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:37,303
Five years in Florida
fixing wet T-shirt contests.

412
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,732
Boy, are you fat.

413
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,735
What did you say?

414
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:59,199
Reginald Van Gleason III.
Boy, are you fat.

415
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,122
That's good, yeah. Here.

416
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,383
So, I got some ideas, you know,
for you. Get you on your feet.

417
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,053
Unless, of course,
you already know what you wanna do.

418
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,679
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

419
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,932
Well, yeah, I kind of got an idea.

420
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,351
Yeah?

421
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,272
Like four years in,
I got moved to Springfield.

422
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,650
You know, where they got
the big prison hospital.

423
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,610
It's mostly stab wounds, detox.

424
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,613
Anyway, this guy I knew from Elkton...

425
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,866
...he was telling me
how I could be an orderly.

426
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,285
You know,
and how it's like easy time and all.

427
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,539
Well, you know, so then you're the guy
that hooks everybody up. That's smart.

428
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,375
Yeah, but it wasn't business for me.

429
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,627
I mean, I really got into this shit.

430
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,756
Rehab block had guys
with broken limbs, muscle diseases...

431
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,133
...and we'd help them back.

432
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,970
So, I think this might be a thing I can do.

433
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,935
I got my associate's degree already.
Took me five years.

434
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,398
And now it's only, like, six months
more for my massage license.

435
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,733
So, you wanna run a massage parlor?

436
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,403
No.

437
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,864
I'm gonna be
a licensed massage therapist.

438
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,705
Look, I've been away
from all this a long time.

439
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:33,711
I mean, if I got a shot at staying out and
putting shit together, I should take it.

440
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,715
Because I was thinking, you know...

441
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,426
...I got this air-bag thing going on...

442
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,262
No, Ton, thanks, but...
I mean, it's a really nice offer...

443
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,640
...but I need regular work
until I'm certified.

444
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,143
Just regular work.

445
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,859
Well, I guess I know
this guy looking for...

446
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,028
...a delivery man for his linen fleet.

447
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,781
- Bobby Gociletto?
- No, no, no, Koreans.

448
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,453
But I don't got my driver's license.

449
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,913
So, why don't you go
to my guy at the DMV?

450
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,627
As far as the union shit,
I can take care of that.

451
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,048
Wow, Ton, thanks. Thank you.

452
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,428
Come here. You're the best,
you know that?

453
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,971
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,151
- Out.
- Why?

455
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,987
Because we are watching a movie,
and you are studying.

456
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,491
And why must we keep
having that conversation?

457
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,289
Here, number one on the American Film
Institute's greatest American movies list.

458
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,875
- Citizen Kane.
- Jesus, it's black and white.

459
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,754
Oh, come on, that is what film club
is all about, trying new things.

460
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,509
Now, to give us some background,
let's see what Leonard Maltin has to say.

461
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,596
"A film that broke all the rules
and invented some new ones.

462
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,808
The cinematography, music
and Oscar-winning screenplay...

463
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:15,020
...by Welles and Herman J. Something
are all first-rate."

464
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,970
WOW

465
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,099
So it was a sled, huh?
He should have told somebody.

466
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,768
It's fascinating that
the man had all that stuff...

467
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,272
...but he died, you know, alone,
with nothing and nobody.

468
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,774
Good. Prick.

469
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:48,947
I hated it. "You supply the war, I'll
supply the headlines." How conceited.

470
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,747
- There was the cinematography.
- Yeah, that was very good.

471
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,463
- Oh, my God.
- What?

472
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,341
I saw Laura Basi in the dressing room
at Loehmann's.

473
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:12,054
Definitely had some work.
D-cup at least, and a lift.

474
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:16,350
Well, she said she was remodeling
her upstairs, but I had no idea...

475
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,149
So, Carm, how you doing?

476
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,859
I'm okay.

477
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,237
My lawyer, he's a top guy,
Robert Greenberg...

478
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,408
...he says that New Jersey
has this equitable-distribution law.

479
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,620
So apparently 20 years entitles me
to at least half his money.

480
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,164
Well, it should. You made Tony a home.

481
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,543
You raised his children.
Does this guy know how to get it?

482
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,088
Well, it's mostly cash, obviously.

483
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,508
God. All those years,
and you could get nothing.

484
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,678
This other lawyer, Dan Minditch,
says we should play hardball.

485
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,513
You know, go after the real assets.

486
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,476
Marriage is beautiful in the beginning,
but two, three years later...

487
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,021
You'd think there'd be
some romance, at least.

488
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,315
- Janice, you're a newlywed.
- I know.

489
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,860
Six months, and Bobby
still hasn't found my rosebud.

490
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,197
Maybe he should hire a reporter.

491
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,994
So the movie's over, and they all
start talking about their marriages...

492
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,829
...and how miserable they are.

493
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,123
Bitterness.

494
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,916
So besides the movie night?

495
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,836
- You have kids?
- No.

496
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,715
So did you attend
Carmine Lupertazzi's funeral?

497
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,717
I didn't know him.

498
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,052
Movie night was fun, though.

499
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,847
Who was there at
the Tony Blundetto homecoming?

500
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,349
I told you, just family.

501
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,145
God, is that all you think about,
is your fucking work?

502
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,358
You don't care
how I feel about anything.

503
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,488
Okay.

504
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,702
I was married to an agent.

505
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,621
What happened?

506
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,749
Did he cheat on you?

507
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,420
While we were trying to get pregnant,
he climbed right over me...

508
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,882
...to become an assistant supervisor
on the Milken task force.

509
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,718
Moved to Los Angeles
and jumped a pay grade without me.

510
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,722
My God, that... That's terrible.

511
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,308
So where were we?

512
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,941
What am I doing? I can't talk to you.

513
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,153
I can't even talk to Christopher,
and he's my soul mate.

514
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,739
I can't talk to my friends.

515
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:41,661
I am being, like, ripped apart here
just snitching on people.

516
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,956
For what? What do I get out of it?

517
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,876
Take comfort in the fact
that you're doing the right thing...

518
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,921
...by helping your government.
No, seriously.

519
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,634
For me, it was when I was in college.

520
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,222
My sister's boyfriend, Kyle,
traded our TV for six handguns.

521
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:06,019
He sold five to a high school kid, then
used the last one to open a coconut.

522
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,939
The ricochet left my sister a paraplegic.

523
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,112
I knew I had to do something
about guys like him.

524
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:22,452
Nowhere but the FBI is the line clearer
between the good guys and the bad guys.

525
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,582
And you're with the good guys now.

526
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,175
Jesus.

527
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,393
- Hey.
- T.B.

528
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,854
I didn't call for no linen delivery.

529
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,774
What do I find at the pork store?
A bunch a guys beating the meat.

530
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,528
- Wanna deal me in?
- Absolutely.

531
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,490
- Stakes might be a little high for you.
- You know you can't pay us in napkins.

532
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,120
You gotta let that dry before
you put on a second coat?

533
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,206
Fucking Grandpa Munster over here.

534
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,501
You gonna deal those?

535
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,171
They're not candy bars.
You can let some of them go.

536
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,384
What the fuck's that for? Drying shirts?

537
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,307
That's a TAO master massage chair.

538
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,275
I had no idea I was so tense.

539
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,486
Like my back is on vacation.

540
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,989
Well, it could definitely use one.

541
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,412
What the fuck is this?

542
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,958
- Hey, T, you gotta try this.
- He's really fucking good.

543
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,504
There's nothing like the joint to teach
you how to ease another man's tensions.

544
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,465
I'm gone for one hour...

545
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,927
...all of a sudden it turns
into a fucking slumber party.

546
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,930
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

547
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,725
Can I talk to you a minute?

548
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,861
None of your fucking business
which side of the bed I wake up on.

549
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,739
- Jesus, it's just an expression.
- Bullshit.

550
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,449
You know what I'm talking about.

551
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,078
All that Reggie Van Gleason,
"Boy, are you fat."

552
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,040
Things have changed around here.
I'm the boss of this fucking family.

553
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,918
You're crowding me.

554
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,338
You don't make fun of me, got it?

555
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,217
Got it.

556
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,307
And knock off the massage shit.

557
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,352
It's a place of business,
not a Jack LaLanne.

558
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,367
You gotta declare all that?

559
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,121
Most of it, anyway.

560
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,292
- Well, if you had a good bookkeeper...
- Hey, you got change?

561
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,254
Been sliding this stupid bill in and out
of the cigarette machine for like an hour.

562
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,882
An hour? I bet you
can go longer than that.

563
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,804
Listen to you. Why do you
always talk like a whore?

564
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,973
Because men like it.

565
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,683
Yeah?

566
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,560
I think you're right about that.

567
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,242
I am having a fucking time.

568
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,204
Stay out late, come home drunk,
fuck anyone I want.

569
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,665
Yeah, so, what's the difference?

570
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,128
I don't know. It's a mindset.

571
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,130
Jesus Christ.

572
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,133
Ton, I was hoping you'd be here.
I gotta tell you...

573
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,136
...you shouldn't go out and eat
up there in Fairfield no more.

574
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,804
What the fuck you talking about?

575
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,266
I went to collect from my cop up there,
and he gave me a heads-up.

576
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:17,520
His buddy on the force saw some car out
by Napoleon's diner a couple weeks ago.

577
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,316
And I remembered how
your goomar lives up there.

578
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,987
- Yeah?
- Guy thought maybe they were fags.

579
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,408
But he ran the plate,
and it bounced back a no hit.

580
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,202
Feds.

581
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,372
Cop said they were
just sitting there in the rain.

582
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,585
I know it wasn't me
they tailed that night.

583
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,754
My whole life's
in the fucking rearview.

584
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,798
- Mine too.
- Absolutely.

585
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,925
It's Massarone.

586
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,429
Jesus Christ. If he flipped, I'd be fucked.

587
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,683
- We all would.
- Well, he ain't been to the grand jury...

588
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,311
...because we would have
heard from our girl up there.

589
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,106
They could be just
following him at this point.

590
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,775
- See if they get anything on him.
- They'll bring him in.

591
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:08,655
Jesus Christ, they've turned a lot fucking
tougher guys than Jack Massarone.

592
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,408
You want me to take care of it?

593
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,494
All right, we don't know shit yet, right?

594
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,209
He did give me that
fucking painting, though.

595
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,963
- There was that, Ton.
- Can't a guy be fucking nice anymore?

596
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,214
Friendly?

597
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,136
So, what do you wanna do?

598
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,764
I wanna be absolutely fucking sure,
that's what I wanna do.

599
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,227
All right, we arrange a meet.
I'll feel him out a little bit.

600
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:46,151
I gotta do it. I know the guy.
I know the way he thinks.

601
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,319
I know the way he acts.

602
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,991
My old man was good
at vibing people out too.

603
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,954
If Massarone's up to something,
I'll pick it up.

604
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,920
You piece of shit. I don't believe this.

605
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,518
Hold on.

606
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah?

607
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,733
I wanted to thank you for taking
components out of the home theater.

608
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,986
Hey, I bought that for us to watch
movies as a family, okay?

609
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,322
Not to entertain your girlfriends.

610
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,867
I talked to my lawyer about
filing a separation agreement.

611
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,704
I'm not paying a lawyer! We should
be able to settle this thing like adults!

612
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,291
Then stop taking shit out of the house!

613
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:59,057
- Hey, Tony, what's up?
- Let's take a walk.

614
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,065
- There he is, huh?
- Hey, how you doing?

615
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,317
- Good, good. How you doing?
- Okay.

616
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,570
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Watch the curb there.

617
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,114
Hey, wait a second.
Before you say anything...

618
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,408
...have you lost a little weight?

619
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,620
You think? I don't know.

620
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:25,750
Listen, I talked to our friend. You know,
the one that celebrates Hanukkah.

621
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,628
- It's in the works.
- Oh, great, that's good news. Thank you.

622
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,672
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,758
So I been meaning to ask you...

624
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,428
...you noticed anything lately?

625
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,347
What are we talking about?

626
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,599
You weren't followed here, were you?

627
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,562
No, I... I don't think so.
I'm pretty careful.

628
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,023
All right.

629
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,067
Everything else okay? Good?

630
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,070
- EKG and shit, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

631
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,363
All right.

632
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,117
But I gotta tell you,
I don't like what I'm hearing.

633
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,915
Relax.

634
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,210
It's not worth losing your hair over.

635
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,129
- Right?
- Okay.

636
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,797
All right.

637
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,387
I couldn't tell shit.
What the fuck am I, a mind reader?

638
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,104
So, what's the next step here, Ton?

639
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,483
What?

640
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,112
Said I looked like I lost some weight.

641
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,202
Motherfucker.

642
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,207
Yeah?

643
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,668
Hey, whoa, whoa.

644
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,712
Take it easy.

645
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,715
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

646
00:43:55,883 --> 00:44:00,053
That Korean, Kim. Something about
your cousin. I don't know.

647
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,727
Yeah.

648
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,150
It's your fucking linen truck.
What do you want me to do about it?

649
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,277
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Fire him. Go ahead.

650
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,364
Put him out in the fucking street
for all I care!

651
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,289
If Tony B. wants to pick up
some scratch...

652
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,168
...he could do this Massarone thing.
If it goes.

653
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,797
What the fuck is wrong with you?
The man is trying to go straight!

654
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,341
Don't you give a fuck about your cousin?

655
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,051
I'm sorry, T, you're right.

656
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,516
That was a great party the other night.

657
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,602
Fuck him.

658
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,313
The guy's fucking useless to me.

659
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,409
Was that a yes on Massarone?

660
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,996
Tony's got his own process.

661
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,874
What's to process here?

662
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:18,423
Honestly, Carm, this is a lot better
than watching Casablanca.

663
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,467
I didn't need to see
that movie again anyway.

664
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:26,347
Even if it kills Tony, I will have
that system back for next time.

665
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,766
So, what is next on that list?

666
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,148
Number three, The Godfather.

667
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,029
Look at us. We'll kill ourselves
for these cigarettes.

668
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,575
You know they had a bear back here?

669
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,453
So how come Angie Bonpensiero
don't come?

670
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,830
Please. She's not welcome here.

671
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,623
I thought everybody liked her.

672
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,208
Don't you know about Pussy?

673
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,546
He went in the program.
He turned on everybody.

674
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,382
Us, the people he knew his whole life.

675
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,555
Who knows why people
do what they do.

676
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,766
But what kind of person does that?

677
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,809
I mean, it's like Judas or something.

678
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,978
Eating that last supper with Jesus...

679
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,148
...and the whole time he knows
they're gonna crucify him.

680
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,778
I mean, at least Judas didn't go
into any apostle protection program.

681
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,781
He hung himself. He knew what he did.

682
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,663
Oh, look at you. You're shivering.

683
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,542
I didn't know it was that cold, sweetie.

684
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,413
I'll tell you, I don't know how
I'd be holding up. It's just...

685
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,292
I guess you all
are really important to me.

686
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,420
Carm, you'd do the same.

687
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,380
We love you so much.

688
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,510
Ade? You okay?

689
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,393
What's the matter?

690
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,359
I'm... I'm not what you think.

691
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,738
I don't know what to do.

692
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,075
I need... I want to tell you all something.

693
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,036
It's driving me crazy.

694
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,872
Well, you know you can tell us anything.

695
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,219
Oh, God.

696
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,099
She's been drinking like crazy.

697
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,065
Where are you going?

698
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,276
Oh, my God.

699
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,279
- Honey.
- Oh, my God.

700
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,114
I'm fine, okay? Just leave me alone.

701
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,242
No, you're bleeding. Let me drive you.

702
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,043
Ton? It's like 3 in the morning.

703
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:09,880
Yeah, yeah, well, I couldn't sleep,
so I wanted to see if the phone worked.

704
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,425
Well, yeah, it works great.

705
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,469
I'm in my mother's basement,
and I can really hear you.

706
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:20,391
Listen, you should know that
that boss there, Kim...

707
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,976
...he's after your ass.

708
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,061
I rub him the wrong way.

709
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,731
Maybe you shouldn't be
a masseuse then.

710
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:33,529
Look, Tony, the reason I called,
you know, about the other day...

711
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,867
...look, you can kid around
with me, okay?

712
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,453
But not when the other guys are there.

713
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,747
I gotta maintain respect.

714
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,833
No, I know. You're the boss.

715
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,378
Jesus. See, you gotta be careful
what you say on this phone.

716
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,090
It doesn't affect you, but it affects me.

717
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,512
Right. I'm sorry.

718
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,727
So everything good over there?

719
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,898
You know, my mom's on my case.

720
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,359
Who'd have thought we'd both be
on our own again?

721
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,987
Well, you can get back together
with Carm if you want.

722
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,907
She thinks it's up to her,
and she goes from zero to bitch...

723
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,618
...every time I try to show
any warmth, you know.

724
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,828
That's gotta be tough.

725
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,086
Listen, Ton, I gotta be up in two hours.

726
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,796
So go to sleep.

727
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,548
But you're my cousin
and my best friend.

728
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,093
You gotta know we could always talk.

729
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,637
Yeah, well, I'll buy a fucking lunch box.

730
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,143
All right, go to sleep, go to sleep.

731
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,956
We gotta talk about
my compensation overall.

732
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,918
Interferon for my son's MS?
That's 20 a year now.

733
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,630
Ray, you said you were gonna get us a
making ceremony, which you didn't do...

734
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,757
...and here you are, asking for a raise.

735
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,176
Can't you talk to the higher-ups?

736
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,766
Okay. We make Vito Spatafore...

737
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,936
...as running Ralph Cifaretto's
construction business.

738
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,271
Has Chris ever confirmed that?

739
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,700
- You wanna know something?
- What?

740
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,829
This girl, she's totally
ripping off her employer.

741
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,123
Probably over a hundred grand.

742
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,917
What do you mean?

743
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,294
Tina Francesco's her name.

744
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,381
She's a bookkeeper
for this furniture wholesaler.

745
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,800
She makes up vendors,
but writes them real checks.

746
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,262
Then her father cashes them.
Is that, like, a federal crime?

747
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,807
How many checks? I mean, how much?

748
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,476
Like I said,
probably over a hundred grand.

749
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,857
- Tina?
- Francesco.

750
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,405
The father's name is Victor.

751
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,242
It's Brettler and Sons Imports.
