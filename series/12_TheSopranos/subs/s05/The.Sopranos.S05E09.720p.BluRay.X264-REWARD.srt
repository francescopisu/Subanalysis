1
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,313
Into the bottom of the eighth.
A very tight game on a hot day.

2
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,233
- Oh, it sure is today, isn't it?
- It certainly is, Roger.

3
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,486
Mets tying it up
2-2 in the sixth.

4
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,029
Man on second.

5
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,824
Want another super nacho?

6
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,910
No, they been sitting too long.
The cheese is all sweaty.

7
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,788
This guy in the joint,
crazy Rasta fuck...

8
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,998
...used to make grilled cheese
on the radiator.

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,084
He put the bread
between two sheets of paper.

10
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,337
Had a whole system.

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,174
- What did you do to your foot?
- The other night. Fucking Irvington.

12
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,719
- Two black guys jumped me outside a bar.
- With half of them locked up...

13
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,765
...making grilled cheese, you'd think there
wouldn't be many around making trouble.

14
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,103
- Should I melt another batch?
- No, I'm good. I got dinner in the city.

15
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,988
So, Finn, you got any plans
for the summer?

16
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,907
Going back to Mission Viejo
to surf or whatever?

17
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,118
Actually, I'm hoping to stay here
in the city.

18
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,288
- How's summer school going?
- It sucks.

19
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,623
I did summer school once.
You can still have fun.

20
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,334
At Casa Carmela? He's looking at
maximum-security summer.

21
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,297
Excuse me a minute.

22
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,467
Why don't you cut your mother a break.
For the record...

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,638
...she's holding this family together
under this current situation and all.

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,602
- Can we get the check, please?
- The young man took care of it.

25
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,114
- You paid the check?
- I figured since you're always so...

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,241
...you know, generous,
I should reciprocate.

27
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,661
You're lucky you don't
get your head handed to you.

28
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,540
- Dad.
- Let's get this straight: You eat. I pay.

29
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,210
- Mr. Soprano...
- No, when you have your own family...

30
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,212
...you pay.

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,303
Let's go.

32
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,600
Just take the money.

33
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,199
Listen, I didn't mean
to bite your head off in there.

34
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,078
No, it's fine. I didn't mean to overstep.
I just wanted to say thank you.

35
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,207
You're a good guy.
I respect you trying.

36
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,381
And then he fell asleep right after.

37
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,929
He did call me late the next morning.
And he sent flowers.

38
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,057
But other than that,
I haven't heard from him all week.

39
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,226
- What did he say?
- That it was nice, you know.

40
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,436
And it was nice.
He was very sweet, actually.

41
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,522
So you think
what happened at the party...

42
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,983
...is an overture
Tony wants to get back together?

43
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,068
I don't know. Maybe.

44
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,863
He's dropping A.J. off later.

45
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,033
This is the last thing
I need to get into right now.

46
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,077
Oh, please, he never had it so good.

47
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,413
Well, that's him.

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,000
You two should talk. Let me just pee.

49
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,543
Okay.

50
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,608
So was your father in a rush now
or something?

51
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,527
I don't know. He said he was tired.

52
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,698
To give you this
and a kiss on the cheek.

53
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,081
Thank God. It's the last thing I needed
was to talk to him.

54
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,970
Know who loved golf?

55
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,058
It was Joey Peeps.
May he rest in peace.

56
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,060
It's sad when they go young like that.

57
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,312
When they go?

58
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,231
Come on, huh?

59
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,025
It was Little Carmine behind it.

60
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,153
Payback for that whore he was fucking,
Lorraine Calluzo.

61
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,989
You don't know that for sure, John.

62
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,993
Little Carmine knew
how fond I was of this kid, Tony.

63
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,703
I picked him out of the chorus.

64
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,039
Schooled him
those years he was my driver.

65
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,293
Anything from your cop?

66
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,129
Some homeless fuck
saw a guy limping away.

67
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,631
And then he wasn't sure.

68
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,946
I'll tell you, I don't know how
I'm gonna get through Joey's funeral.

69
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,031
And forget about Ginny.

70
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,619
Every Christmas, Joey would send her
a Grandma's of Maine coffeecake.

71
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,664
What's wrong? You all right?

72
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,916
- Is it his heart?
- No. It's this fucking weather.

73
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,586
Sudden changes.
Fucks up your respiratory system.

74
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,963
- Come on.
- Get some...

75
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,048
- I got you.
- Get some electrolytes in him.

76
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,591
- We got you.
- Come on, buddy.

77
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,927
- Come on.
- That's it. Sit down.

78
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,721
Good, good. That's it. That's it.

79
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,807
You're all right. You're all right.

80
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,978
The point I am trying
to illustrate...

81
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,982
...is that of course no one wants
all-out conflict.

82
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,610
But historically, historical changes
have come out of war.

83
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,740
Far as I'm concerned, it's a new day. All
old treaties and ways of doing things...

84
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,034
...are null and void.
Exactly.

85
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,705
And the Joe Peeps thing?
Where does that leave us?

86
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,541
When you've had
a quadruple bypass like I did...

87
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,210
...it gives you a lot of time to think.

88
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,464
The only thing Johnny understands
is force.

89
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,050
But the fact is, though,
we pissed on a bees' nest.

90
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,012
So, what's the other option? Rollover?

91
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,434
We could've had a sit-down.

92
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,188
- The other captains, maybe.
- This isn't the U.N., Angelo.

93
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,024
I won't let what happened to my father
happen to me.

94
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,904
God forgive me, but you may be
a stronger man than your dad was.

95
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,614
The fundamental question is:

96
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,200
Will I be as effective as a boss
like my dad was?

97
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,454
And I will be. Even more so.
But until I am...

98
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,624
...it's gonna be hard to verify that
I think I'll be more effective.

99
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,376
I just talked to my parents.

100
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,796
They offered me a JetBlue ticket home.
No economic relief.

101
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,882
What did the lady
at Student Placement say?

102
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,510
- I never went down there.
- Why didn't you?

103
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,220
This economy? Hello?

104
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,722
I mean, even the crappiest McJobs
aren't there.

105
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,351
Besides, I wouldn't wanna take away
a job a minority could have.

106
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,814
Just... It doesn't cool anything
anyway. Leave it.

107
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,026
Don't open the window.
The garbage reeks.

108
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,278
Why do we wanna be
in New York anyway?

109
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,658
It was supposed to be fun, remember?
Summer before the big grad school push.

110
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,993
You could go out to Jersey,
sleep in comfort.

111
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,581
- Is that what you want?
- No.

112
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,503
All I know is, I cannot go home
and live with my parents.

113
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,090
I graduated.

114
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,725
I mean, maybe I should go back out.
I can work as a PA for Josh's dad.

115
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,018
At least I'd earn some cash.

116
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,105
- You could come out for a week.
- Wait, wait. What?

117
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,317
He's a photographer, I told you.
He does major magazine ads. BMW.

118
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,902
It's pretty cool stuff.

119
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,363
- Is that what you want?
- No.

120
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,949
But at least I'd have money.

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,868
- Your thing with models.
- There's no models.

122
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,997
- What?
- It's interesting work.

123
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,083
As a career, actually. I mean...

124
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,086
...Josh's dad saw my shots
that won the prize in high school...

125
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,463
...said they were solidly unsentimental.

126
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,884
What are you talking about?
Just blow off dental school?

127
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:59,306
You haven't taken a photograph in a year.
You bitch every time we're at a party...

128
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,891
...and I ask you to take a snap
of me and my friends.

129
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,519
- Look, I'm just saying.
- I gave up junior year abroad...

130
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,981
...so we could be together.
I know, and I wanna stay here.

131
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,983
I could come out west with you.

132
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,904
- But I have to blow off the law center.
- Is that what you wanna do?

133
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,990
I don't know.
Do you want me to come out?

134
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,993
- If you want to.
- No, you need to say.

135
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,290
Maybe we should stay out there.
You could transfer to UCLA.

136
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,295
Fuck it.

137
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,589
It's roasting in here.

138
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,008
It's 10:30.
We can still get into a movie.

139
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,139
- What do you wanna see?
- I don't know. You say.

140
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,308
No, you.

141
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,693
- Hello?
- Mrs. Soprano.

142
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,780
- Lee Nieman, returning.
- Oh, hi, great. Thank you.

143
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,866
The reason I called...
I gave your secretary the broad strokes.

144
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,036
You're in the middle of a separation,
the original attorney retired.

145
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,704
Right. Bob Greenberg.

146
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,417
At any rate, I'm thinking it's time I move
forward with the divorce proceedings.

147
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,045
Mrs. Soprano, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to cut you short.

148
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,964
As far as handling it,
I'm afraid I have to recuse myself.

149
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,925
What do you mean? Why?

150
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,098
Actually, your husband had been in
to see me for a consultation last year.

151
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,433
- My husband hired you?
- No.

152
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,895
But based on a prior meeting,
the code of professional responsibility...

153
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,981
...precludes me from representing you
because of that consultation.

154
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,068
But he met with Greenberg too,
and he was willing to represent me.

155
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,698
Mr. Greenberg would've found himself in
some ethical soup had he moved forward.

156
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,033
I don't understand this.
Why is my husband so picky?

157
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,453
He talked to seven or eight of the
top divorce attorneys in New Jersey.

158
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,623
Well, you can probably
figure that maneuver out for yourself.

159
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,043
Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,630
I understand your frustration.
If you like, I can recommend a colleague.

161
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,632
Someone your husband
hasn't contaminated.

162
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,885
Well, yeah, okay.

163
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,270
According to Johnny Sack, kid's brains
were splattered all over the seat.

164
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,063
Joe Peeps?

165
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,774
Couldn't have been too much
to clean up.

166
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,570
I heard the hooker he was with
got it in the chest.

167
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,322
Must have been silicone
everywheres too.

168
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,199
Why you always try and top me?

169
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,786
You took the air right out of
my whole fucking punch line, asshole.

170
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,664
Anyway, Joey Peeps' mom's a widow.

171
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,000
She's in a wheelchair.

172
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,336
Johnny's taking care of the internment,
that shit there.

173
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,505
I'm thinking we should
pick up the headstone.

174
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,135
- Jason, get into it.
- I'll call the marble guy.

175
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,555
- What's up, guys?
- Frankie.

176
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,849
- Frankie.
- Talk to you outside?

177
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,732
Give me two.

178
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,038
What's up?

179
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,583
Turns out somebody got a look
at the guy that did Joe Peeps.

180
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,337
All they got so far
is he's got a bad limp.

181
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,338
AHH.

182
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,714
Long John Silver, maybe.

183
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,759
Where the fuck do you get the balls?

184
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,262
I am bending over backwards
trying to stay neutral.

185
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,014
Paying for fucking car seats.

186
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,309
And you're out there
acting like a fucking free-agent!

187
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,064
And don't look at me
like I'm a fucking jerk-off.

188
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,067
I'm sick of you leaning on this
cousin thing and that bad hijack...

189
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,945
...like you can do
whatever the fuck it is you wanna do...

190
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,280
...because you went away that night,
and I didn't.

191
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,659
You're the one who keeps
bringing that up. I'm fine with it.

192
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,628
First of all, for the record,
I had nothing to do with this.

193
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,672
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- Even if I was...

194
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,215
...would you really wanna know?

195
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,845
That would just be another problem
for you with Johnny, right?

196
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,062
All right, look, I know
you're not earning what you expected...

197
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,939
...and you got the twins and Nancy.

198
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,024
You're a capable guy.

199
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,530
Your mother let it slip one time:
You got an IQ of 158.

200
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,991
- She told you that?
- It was the week you got tested.

201
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,118
All the fucking nuns
were raving about it.

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,954
Lot of good it did me.

203
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,999
I had high hopes when you got out.

204
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,128
- Yeah?
- Look, a guy like you, brains, balls...

205
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,423
If you'd fucking be straight with me,
I could use all that.

206
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,050
Put me in, coach.

207
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,771
All right, we got the casino on Bloomfield
Avenue above the hardware store.

208
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,276
Carlo's guy was running it, but he just
got diagnosed with the Hodgkin's.

209
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,944
- That's mine?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,074
A lot of fucking money there.

211
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,161
And I'll see what I can do
about getting you straightened out.

212
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,455
Opening up the books for you.

213
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,583
It's long overdue.

214
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,593
So I solved a major problem,
business-wise.

215
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,721
Put a very good
piece of manpower to work.

216
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,725
- My cousin Tony.
- You mentioned how close you two are.

217
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,519
When we were kids,
they called me Tony Uncle Johnny...

218
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,106
...and they'd call him Tony Uncle Al.
Right. Yes. You told me all that.

219
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,735
Anyway, he's a very smart guy.
He's got an IQ of 158.

220
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,738
Do you put a lot of stock
into that number?

221
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,115
Why? Are you gonna tell me
it's bullshit?

222
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,203
Because I took that test,
and somebody gets a 158...

223
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,580
...well, they know a few things.

224
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,667
So we can assume
you think he's smarter than you.

225
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,963
Honestly, I think he's smarter than you,
the way you keep shitting on the test.

226
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,092
But I'm no gabbadotz myself.
This was a good move.

227
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,392
Carmela and I slept together.

228
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,688
- What was that like?
- It was nice.

229
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,023
It was very...

230
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,525
...erotic.

231
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,780
She was wearing that perfume
that she wears.

232
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,993
Poor thing
was starved for it, honestly.

233
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,790
I'm the only man
she's ever been with.

234
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,375
Did you discuss it?

235
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,087
No, I left before she woke up.

236
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,464
How come?

237
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,219
Because if she woke up and I was there,
it would send mixed signals, you know.

238
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,055
I'm not sure that's the best...

239
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,436
Yeah.

240
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,983
No. Tell him I got fax machines
coming out of my ass.

241
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:12,572
And would you characterize
the separation thus far as amicable?

242
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,824
Ahh, It's barely civil.

243
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah, there are moments when
old habits kick in and, you know, feelings.

244
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,124
But he is definitely not the person
I wanna spend the rest of my life with.

245
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,877
Fair enough. As for the assets...

246
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,880
...you've given me your tax returns
and investments here?

247
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,507
The house is in my name,
not the boat.

248
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,595
- That's the Stugots, is it?
- Yes.

249
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,973
I'm a little concerned that the returns
don't really reflect everything.

250
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,100
There is other income.
There's a lot more.

251
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,438
- Unreported income?
- Yes.

252
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,900
And this other income,
is it from an illegal stream?

253
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,860
No, of course not.

254
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,031
But he does deal in cash, my husband.
The carting business.

255
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,783
I see.

256
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,242
Is that a problem?

257
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,369
I handled a case once...

258
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,040
...where the husband
owned vending machines.

259
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,461
I used a forensic accountant
to reconstruct his finances.

260
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,963
In less than a week...

261
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,674
...he outlined 11 years of income.

262
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,260
And we're talking coins.

263
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,016
Hey, you. Busy day?

264
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,730
I dropped off application
at the Cineplex on Broadway.

265
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,023
Stopped by my dad's.

266
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,609
Looks like he got you a job
working construction.

267
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,362
Construction? That's awesome.

268
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,448
It's in Jersey, though,
so you'll have to take the PATH train.

269
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,534
Fine, no problem.

270
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,246
But the most I ever did, though,
is, like, help my dad paint.

271
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,749
He said you don't need experience.
You'll be a laborer or something.

272
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,709
Pays like 20 bucks an hour.

273
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,129
Holy shit.

274
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,422
How is that even possible?

275
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,727
You believe these fucking Blue Jays?
Last inning, I screamed so loud...

276
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,938
...my wife thought
I was having a heart attack.

277
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,481
Why, what happened?

278
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,734
Burrell got shelled. It was beautiful.

279
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,070
- What are you, a Met fan?
- Padres, actually.

280
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,406
- Padres?
- I'm from California.

281
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,074
I gotta go make my collections.

282
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,619
Stick with the Angels.
The Pads haven't had a team in 20 years.

283
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,873
What are you talking about?
They were in the Series in '98.

284
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,457
Yanks in four. I was there.

285
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,925
Hey, shaggy. Grab a bucket
and some Lysol, scrub off my tires.

286
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,428
There's fucking dog shit all over
by the entrance.

287
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,388
I'm supposed to be picking up scrap.

288
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,057
You'll be picking up your teeth
in another second.

289
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,643
Hey, DeTrolio,
you need something to do?

290
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,187
Get fucking lost!

291
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,606
Come on, guys.

292
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,651
Go! Before it sets in the treads.

293
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,115
My checks come in yet?

294
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,827
- I don't know. I didn't see the girl.
- If she ain't got them, send the kid.

295
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,038
Meadow's friend.
When he's done with your car.

296
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,081
Who Meadow?
What are you talking about?

297
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,084
Meadow Soprano.
That's her boyfriend.

298
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,881
There he is.

299
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,343
- I can't find any Lysol.
- Don't worry about it.

300
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,678
Why didn't you tell me
you were dating my niece?

301
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,097
Here.

302
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,685
You take her someplace nice.

303
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,938
Make sure you tell her
it's from Uncle Paulie.

304
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,066
Thank you, I... That's really nice.

305
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,652
Here. Give me that shit.

306
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,529
Paulie! Come here.

307
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,823
Get the hose.

308
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,957
Sorry I'm late.

309
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,044
- You been waiting long?
- Not really.

310
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,842
So to what do I owe this pleasure?

311
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,804
I don't know
if you're gonna see it that way.

312
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,099
I have asked you to lunch
to tell you that I'm filing for divorce.

313
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,021
I hope you brought your appetite.

314
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,818
Why don't you give us a minute.

315
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,074
Oh, that's nice.

316
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,077
Invite me to...

317
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,539
...a public place
so you could ambush me.

318
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,669
- What, you think I won't make a scene?
- Spare me your outrage, Tony.

319
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,088
Accept the fact
that I am moving on with my life.

320
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,090
Moving on?

321
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,051
That's what you were doing
after the party last week?

322
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,512
You and I both know
that didn't change anything.

323
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,473
Well, first of all, we're Italian.
We don't believe in divorce.

324
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,352
- We believe in the nuclear family.
- Will you listen to yourself?

325
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,191
Despite your best efforts...

326
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,280
...I have an attorney who will
aggressively pursue my custody of A.J...

327
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,575
...and also an equitable distribution
of our assets.

328
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,035
Our assets?

329
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,997
I am through trying to get you to provide
beyond the minimum I need to live.

330
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,791
Oh, so it's fucking money?
That's all this is to you?

331
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,461
After all we've been through,
is it so hard to own up...

332
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,088
...to anything beyond
that bullshit tax return?

333
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,636
Go stand over there.
I'll call you when I'm ready.

334
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,017
You want money?

335
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,978
How about my 40 grand you stole?
That should be plenty.

336
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,190
- You're such an investment genius.
- You want this to get ugly, Tony?

337
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,485
- Because these guys live for that.
- Oh, you think I don't?

338
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,370
The only reason you have anything
is because of my fucking sweat.

339
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,289
And you knew every step of the way
exactly how it works.

340
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,875
But you walk around
that fucking mansion...

341
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,044
...in your $500 shoes
and your diamond rings...

342
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,422
...and you act like butter
wouldn't melt in your mouth.

343
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,591
And you don't want it to get ugly?

344
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,009
Too late.

345
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,721
- I want what I am entitled to.
- You're entitled to shit.

346
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,184
She's ready to order.

347
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,153
I guess we get along.
We're just different, you know.

348
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,906
She zigs, I zag. That kind of thing.

349
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,992
What's her dad like?
He's always flirting.

350
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,122
He's okay.
A little intense sometimes.

351
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,046
The main thing's
that he's a good person.

352
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,761
- So you guys gonna get married or what?
- Living together's the same thing.

353
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,889
I lived with a guy once,
and trust me...

354
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,183
...it's not even close
to being the same thing.

355
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,644
- What do you mean? Why?
- Because.

356
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,440
You could just pack up and leave
whenever the shit hits the fan.

357
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,275
Talk to married people.

358
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:09,864
That ring, believe it or not,
it's got this kind of, like, weird power.

359
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:14,577
- What happened with you and this guy?
- Phineas, me boy.

360
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,329
Hey. It's...
It's actually just Finn.

361
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,624
So the Cubbies gave your boys
a shellacking last night.

362
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,751
- It's still early.
- That's true.

363
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,213
You know who he looks like?
That guy from Aerosmith, Joe Perry.

364
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,967
- Your boss inside?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,429
- All right. I'll see youse around.
- All right.

366
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,641
He seems like a nice guy.

367
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,187
Yeah. They all are, pretty much.

368
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,522
So you dating anybody now?

369
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,117
It's cute.

370
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,413
- That's a lot of money for not much shirt.
- Relax. I'll put it on my own card.

371
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,500
- Yes, you're damn right you will.
- What's that supposed to mean?

372
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,667
Well, ask your father.

373
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,420
- He stopped paying my credit-card bills.
- Daddy?

374
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,006
You guys looked chummy
in the pool that night.

375
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,009
Well, he went home with Artie.
They helped me clean up.

376
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,101
I have decided to move ahead
with the divorce.

377
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,022
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?

378
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,067
- Life. I don't know.
- Well, what can I do?

379
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,986
Haven't you ever thought beyond
being dependent on some man?

380
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,780
It's so simple for you, isn't it?

381
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,492
It's simple for everybody who isn't
expecting things to be handed to them.

382
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,287
- Even Finn got a job working construction.
- Well, good for Finn, then.

383
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,790
There are options in life.

384
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,960
- Isn't that what you always told me?
- You have options.

385
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,461
I have a lawyer.

386
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,936
Phineas, he was just asking,
how come a dentist?

387
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,105
What's wrong with being
a regular doctor?

388
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,691
I saw this thing on shark teeth
when I was little.

389
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,985
Hey, Phil.

390
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,487
Glad to see you're not exerting yourself
in the heat.

391
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,447
Of course, now he comes.

392
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:20,035
When the Jersey tomatoes are in season,
can't keep these New York guys away.

393
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,371
Fuck the tomatoes.
I'll take the scarole.

394
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,789
You know my brother, Billy?

395
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,250
- Yeah, what do you say, Bill?
- How you doing?

396
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,043
- Hey, Felicia.
- What?

397
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,797
- Those cases of toner come in yet?
- Yeah. It's in the trailer.

398
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,425
I'm gonna gas up, I'll be right back.

399
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,305
Toner cartridges now? You're not
skimming enough from this job?

400
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,141
- Brother sells them out of his trunk.
- Jesus.

401
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,311
So, Patsy, the necklace,
how'd it go over with the goomar?

402
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,563
Beautiful. With the little emeralds.

403
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,273
- She fucking loved it.
- Yeah.

404
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,359
First he gave her the emeralds,
then he gave her the pearls.

405
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,989
I got Ebel watches too.
Earrings, whatever you need.

406
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,367
- My girl's birthday's coming up.
- Some rack on that girl.

407
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,412
Yeah, if you can
get past the sideburns.

408
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,957
You should talk.
That skank I saw you with.

409
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,794
This girl's fucking mustache,
it must have been like kissing a fireman.

410
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,255
Well, you ought to know, sweetie.

411
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,761
- What did you say?
- Nothing, what?

412
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,554
We're just breaking balls.

413
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,351
- Finn, what time's that game tonight?
- Eight o'clock, I think.

414
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,895
I'm gonna take a piss.

415
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,023
Do me a favor, huh? Hold this.

416
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,027
Oh, shit!

417
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,363
- I knew that was coming.
- My eye!

418
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,366
Your eye? I'm sorry.
I meant to hit you in the fucking mouth!

419
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,994
- Hey.
- Gene, Gene, relax.

420
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,372
- You okay?
- All right. Come on.

421
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,834
- Come on, come on.
- You made your point.

422
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,462
Felicia, call an ambulance.

423
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,548
- Use your own phone, I'm busy.
- You been sick all day.

424
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,301
- Why don't you take the day off.
- Well, what about him?

425
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,303
One of these civilians calls the cops?

426
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,682
What? I think I seen a couple of niggers
running that way.

427
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,350
Oh, yeah, those two guys.

428
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,644
Need to rest? You want some water?

429
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,853
You sure?

430
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:16,068
- Eugene Pontecorvo? He's so sweet.
- Sweet? He was like an animal.

431
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,034
- Are you gonna eat?
- I'm not hungry. It's too hot anyway.

432
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,036
I told you I was making dinner tonight.

433
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,339
It's really good chili.

434
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,930
You should've seen these guys.
They were laughing, it was fucking sick.

435
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,142
- I mean, is this what you grew up with?
- What are you talking about?

436
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,354
- These people. Your dad's friends.
- I never saw any violence growing up.

437
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,023
What about your dad's road rage?

438
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,568
Didn't you tell me
you had a boyfriend who was killed?

439
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,196
- Shot to death or something?
- First of all, he was killed by drug dealers.

440
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,991
African-Americans,
if that makes you feel any better.

441
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,707
You know, you talk about these guys
like it's an anthropology class.

442
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,960
But the truth is, they bring certain modes
of conflict resolution...

443
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,463
...from all the way back
in the old country.

444
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,968
From the poverty of the Mezzogiorno,
where all higher authority was corrupt.

445
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,308
For the Lord Jesus Christ will change
our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.

446
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,103
For he is risen.
The first born from the dead.

447
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,107
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life...

448
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,109
...through our Lord Jesus Christ...

449
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,362
...we commend to almighty God
our brother Joseph...

450
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,157
...and we commit his body
to its resting place.

451
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,034
Peeps?

452
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:51,747
It's a fucking nickname.
Family name is Pepparelli.

453
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,334
They're gonna redo it.

454
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,088
Fucking Jason. He's dyslexic.

455
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,382
What's that got to do with it?

456
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:10,057
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
the Lord bless him and keep him.

457
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,644
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him.

458
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,314
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace.

459
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,235
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen.

460
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,029
Amen.

461
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,969
John. Johnny, John. Hey.

462
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,264
I'm sorry about the stone.
It was a mistake. We'll fix it.

463
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,394
You remember Mickey Farrell?
Dockworkers, used to run Port Newark.

464
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,565
Guess who he saw on the upper west side
the other night? Your cousin Tony.

465
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,609
- So, what does that mean?
- The same night Joey bought it?

466
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,611
You flip your Maserati, hit your head?

467
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,239
- You two-faced fuck!
- Take it easy.

468
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,077
You wanna yell at somebody, the man
you should talk to is right over there.

469
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,582
That fucking cocksucker.

470
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:22,045
I should fucking kill him and his
fucking wife and your cousin next.

471
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,966
All right, come on.
Let's take a walk, calm down. Come on.

472
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,069
The fucking gall on that man!
His father must be spinning.

473
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,031
You want my advice?

474
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,452
You go out there, you shake his hand,
and you put this fucking shit to bed.

475
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,663
Shake his hand?
And he kisses the kid's mother?

476
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,999
That's the way it works, John.
You know that.

477
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,252
- Sure, that's why your cousin's here.
- You are sincerely mistaken...

478
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,964
...if you think me or my cousin had
anything to do with any of this shit.

479
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,801
- He was spotted three blocks away.
- By Mickey Farrell.

480
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,597
You're gonna believe some
drunken Irish fucking prick over me?

481
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,602
Have a drink.

482
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,105
- I don't want a fucking drink.
- Have one anyway.

483
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,946
So how's your daughter doing?

484
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,115
Good.

485
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,755
All right, maybe I'm wrong...

486
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,718
...but you haven't been yourself
since the old man died.

487
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,931
Lorraine Calluzo.

488
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,726
Then you sink this idiot's boat.

489
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:05,983
- It's not the Johnny Sack I know.
- I'm waiting for your explanation, Tony.

490
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,780
My cousin could not have been in the city
that night, because he was with me.

491
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,829
We were looking for his daughter, John.
Because she fucking disappeared.

492
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,041
We were upstate, Monticello.

493
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:28,005
We'd heard Kelly had been living with
some fucking crackhead up there.

494
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,384
Matter of fact, we were gonna
reach out to you.

495
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,303
See if you could get some
of your people on her.

496
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,808
I swear on my mother, Tony,
if I find out you're lying...

497
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,481
I'm sitting here humbling myself
out of friendship to you, John.

498
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,864
There he is.
Three out of four dentists surveyed.

499
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,950
- Hey, how you doing?
- Where you going? Come here.

500
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,292
Okay, settle this:

501
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,963
If they fought today, both in their prime:
Ali or Tyson?

502
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,466
If you were laying a bet.

503
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,343
Jeez...

504
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,596
I... I really don't know.

505
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,723
He don't know.
It's an opinion.

506
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:09,022
To tell you the truth, after the other day,
I really don't wanna say the wrong thing.

507
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,024
You see? This kid's all right.

508
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,528
I should get back.
Ramos will be on my ass.

509
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,615
Would you forget about Ramos,
for chrissakes. I talked to him.

510
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,537
We got the good doughnuts today.

511
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,055
I'm fucking exhausted,
I hardly slept at all last night.

512
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,432
So take a nap.
What are you worried about?

513
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:01,741
You know the money in that casino?
And to give it to Tony B?

514
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,787
Guy's back on the street two minutes,
gets a fucking promotion.

515
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,125
- Did you even go to the fucking store?
- They're in the freezer, like you like.

516
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,630
Now he's talking about
getting a maid, Tony B.

517
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Really?

518
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,676
Guy gets out of jail,
suddenly I'm dog shit in Tony's eye.

519
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,052
- Chrissy.
- It's true.

520
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,722
Ever since I cleaned up,
no matter what he says...

521
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,684
...he don't believe a person can change.
And this asshole went to a shrink.

522
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,688
Maybe he thinks you're working too hard.
North Carolina, plus all that other stuff.

523
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,984
I can multitask, Adriana,
I'm not a fucking retard.

524
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,652
It's always some shit with him:

525
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,823
Side deals, secret promises.
He's always got an agenda.

526
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,201
What happened to not sweating
the small stuff?

527
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,870
All I know is,
I used to be number-one cousin.

528
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,997
Now I'm being eased aside.

529
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,960
Your whole attitude in general.

530
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,591
And while we're at it, kindly remember
what we said about interrupting...

531
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,927
...to ask for things
while I'm on the telephone.

532
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,012
Okay, Mom.

533
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,932
- Hello?
- It's me.

534
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,934
Hi, what's up?

535
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,945
Dale just told us
he figured out the rest of his life.

536
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,572
- You still thinking CIA?
- Yeah, fight terror.

537
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,826
- No, I'm gonna go to film school.
- Me too.

538
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,089
I gotta motor.

539
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,633
You don't have to work
for like three hours.

540
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,969
He has to sleep a little.

541
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,180
I'll get a ride with Alex.

542
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,599
At this point,
it doesn't even pay to go home.

543
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,018
Maybe I'll just crash at work.

544
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,479
Felicia told me where she
keeps a key to the trailer.

545
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,648
Felicia told him.

546
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,696
- Be careful driving.
- All right. I'll see you tonight.

547
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,117
- Later.
- Bye.

548
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,145
You sound like a racehorse
pissing in there.

549
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,982
Hey, how's it going?

550
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,364
I never asked you
what your last name is.

551
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:32,577
- It's DeTrolio.
- Finn DeTrolio. My arch nemesis.

552
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,123
- You enjoying yourself here?
- It's all right.

553
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,377
I keep telling you,
you shouldn't work so hard.

554
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:45,965
Long hours, this fucking heat.
Plus, you came in so early today.

555
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,969
I just do what the job is.

556
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,763
Good.

557
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,849
You're strong. That helps.

558
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:02,107
- You know, you can call me Vito.
- Yeah, I know.

559
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,863
So say it. Let me hear you say,
"What's up, Vito?"

560
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,991
What's up, Vito?

561
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,036
Not much, Finn.
Except I got a little surprise for you:

562
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,166
Two tickets to see your Padres
take a beating from the Yanks tonight.

563
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,463
- Shit.
- Third-base line. Plus, it's bat night.

564
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:31,094
That's really nice, Vito, but I...
Don't know if I can...

565
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:35,223
Don't pull that "aw, shucks" shit
with me. You're fucking going.

566
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,608
I'll see you under the bat tonight.
Seven sharp.

567
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,111
And I don't like to miss
the national anthem.

568
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,174
So you're just not gonna show up? You
love baseball. What is wrong with you?

569
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,926
I don't like the guy, all right?

570
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,013
Right. I get it.

571
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:19,058
Dr. DeTrolio can't hang
with the common folk.

572
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,314
He came on to me, all right?
Either that, or he wants to kill me.

573
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,565
What?

574
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,444
I saw him blowing some security guard
in the parking lot.

575
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,781
- When? What are you talking about?
- This morning, I showed up early...

576
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:38,036
...I didn't wanna say anything,
but I'm really afraid of this guy.

577
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:45,001
Vito Spatafore is a married man, Finn.
I seriously doubt he wants to kill you.

578
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,378
Well, maybe he wants to fuck me
and then kill me.

579
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,968
Wait a minute, is that why
you got out the suitcase?

580
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,721
I am not going back to the site.

581
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,974
Do you have any idea the strings
my father pulled to get you that job...

582
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,145
...and you just fucking quit?
I'm gonna hear so much bullshit.

583
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,855
So it's all about you, right?

584
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,651
Is that all you can say whenever
it's anything to do with my feelings?

585
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,864
- So you're going back to Mission Viejo?
- I didn't say that.

586
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,491
Why don't you just admit it?

587
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,369
This whole thing,
the fight, the stuff with Vito...

588
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,704
...it's really about you
not wanting to commit.

589
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,333
- I'm right here. We fucking live together.
- But you got out a suitcase.

590
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,045
It's my process, okay?
Look, you never can tell.

591
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,215
- Your process?
- About anything. The future. I was...

592
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,133
...thinking out loud.

593
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:39,222
Well, not out loud, but in the action
of getting the suitcase, I was thinking.

594
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,933
- Thinking of leaving.
- No.

595
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:47,021
- Well, yes. But I'm still here. I didn't go.
- Fuck you!

596
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,023
Right. Great. Fuck me.

597
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,944
There was no abundant intentionality
in me getting out the suitcase.

598
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,030
I could leave too, you know.
My friend Hunter's in Montreal.

599
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,032
Do I know?
With the French roommate guy...

600
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,743
...who was all over your ass
the time that we visited.

601
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,706
You don't think you keep mentioning him
every 24 hours at a minimum?

602
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,503
Because he's thinking of becoming
an oral surgeon.

603
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,297
And you might've had a new friend...

604
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,341
...if you hadn't been so obnoxious
to him at the club!

605
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,514
- Can we just stop fighting?
- You got out a suitcase!

606
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,391
I'll put it back, okay?

607
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,621
Now batting for the Padres...

608
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,883
So it's not about us, but suddenly
you're talking about options?

609
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,052
Don't paraphrase what I said.

610
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:05,475
I said this point in our lives is a transition
period, forced on us by external events.

611
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,687
School is over for me,
and next year, for you.

612
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,982
These are difficult choices. What?
You'd rather not have choices?

613
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,486
- Thank God for choices.
- Oh, stop your bullshit!

614
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:20,156
It's really simple.
Are we going to stay together or not?

615
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,700
- If you want.
- That's not what I asked.

616
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,535
- I said I did.
- And then you said:

617
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,412
"How are we gonna keep it together...

618
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,748
...through four years
of dental school for you...

619
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,834
...and probably med school for me?"
Well, it's a good question.

620
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,588
But why ask it now?
Tonight, of all times?

621
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,682
- Are you asleep?
- No.

622
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,727
You were. And now you're gonna lie,
like you did about the suitcase.

623
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:54,232
- I did not lie about the suitcase.
- Oh, then what do you call it?

624
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,777
I don't know, I explained it.
Jesus, you should quit the law center.

625
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,863
You're like a prosecutor.
At 4 in the morning, I can't think.

626
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,700
How can you sleep
when we're in the middle of this?

627
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,328
In the middle of what? All I said was
I didn't wanna go back to the job site...

628
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,623
...and maybe I should go home
until this thing with Vito blows over.

629
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,041
But you didn't ask me to come.

630
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,961
You went right to the closet
and got out your suitcase.

631
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,671
Jesus Christ!

632
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,163
Look, just stop crying, okay?

633
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,665
Why don't we just get married.

634
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,127
Married?

635
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,088
Let's get engaged.

636
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,174
Really?

637
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,052
Why are you saying that now?

638
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,849
I can't think, it's too late.
It's just something I feel very strongly.

639
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,896
I was wondering when I was gonna
hear from you. Never got your statement.

640
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,150
Well, actually, that's why I called.
We hit a bit of a snag.

641
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,735
What kind of snag?

642
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,989
Well, I put a call in to Phil Canter
a few days ago, the forensic accountant.

643
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,868
- The one with the vending machines.
- But then I didn't hear back from him.

644
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,037
Suddenly he called
and said he wasn't interested.

645
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,415
- So I called another accountant.
- And?

646
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,377
Frankly, when he heard your husband
was the defendant...

647
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,045
...he demurred as well.

648
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,506
So, what does this mean,
you don't want the case?

649
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,593
Well, as my partners reminded me,
I do have a full caseload already.

650
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,971
I probably should've mentioned...

651
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,614
And you were feeling so positive.

652
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,994
I woke up this morning,
the depression just washed over me.

653
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,746
You are dissolving a 20-year marriage.

654
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,000
It's not my
fucking goddamn marriage, okay?

655
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,590
I had another panic attack.

656
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,136
- And I thought I had this shit beat.
- What happened?

657
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,723
Playing golf with a friend of mine,
and he was...

658
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,227
...talking about this young guy he knew
who passed away.

659
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,439
And I guess I became
overcome with emotion...

660
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,358
...because they had to help me
off the tee.

661
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,743
It's not the first time
it's happened recently.

662
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,622
- I wish you had told me.
- Yeah, well, I wish you'd cured it.

663
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:46,088
When the attacks first reappeared,
what was going on in your life?

664
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,716
You had just rebuffed my affections.

665
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,931
When you actually passed out,
were you thinking about me, or...?

666
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,893
I walked into my house,
and the cleaning girl was...

667
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,771
...crying on the phone
about her cousin...

668
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,067
...who went off the road
in a Mexican bus wreck or something.

669
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,985
And I remember just...

670
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,738
...feeling inside like
I wanted to fucking choke her...

671
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,823
...because it was always something
with her.

672
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,161
Next thing I know:

673
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,497
When did it next happen?

674
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,543
My cousin Tony was up by the house.

675
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:29,548
He wanted to borrow some tools,
and they weren't there.

676
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,344
I was inside talking to Carmela
and started to feel that...

677
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,807
You know. And it passed.

678
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,478
- Your cousin was at your house?
- Yeah.

679
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,065
- Tony Uncle Whatever?
- Uncle Al.

680
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,193
And your maid was crying
about her cousin?

681
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,656
The other day at the golf course...

682
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,243
...my cousin entered into that too.

683
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,996
- In what way?
- He hurt his foot.

684
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,457
You were so concerned
about your cousin's foot...

685
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:08,129
...you collapsed on the golf course?
I worry about him.

686
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,297
He's a grown man, isn't he?

687
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,762
- Is he in danger of losing the foot or...?
- Fuck his foot! It's not his foot!

688
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,264
Forget the foot!

689
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:27,064
I worry about him. He's...
He's right out of fucking jail, okay?

690
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,282
All right, look.

691
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,369
The reason he went to prison...

692
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,498
...is he got pinched hijacking
a truckload of Betamaxes in '86.

693
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:48,377
And they hooked him up on a RICO,
and he got 17 years.

694
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,007
And I was supposed to be there
the night of the jacking.

695
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,972
- I see.
- Oh, you see?

696
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,020
- Why didn't you go?
- I was jumped by a bunch of melanzanes.

697
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,731
They were trying to take my shoes.
I fought them off...

698
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,068
...but they cut my fucking head open,
the fucking jigaboo...

699
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,362
...cocksucking motherfuckers...
Okay, forget that.

700
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:20,534
Your cousin went to prison.
That's tremendous guilt to carry.

701
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,581
He went to Nam, I was 4-F.
And that's the way our friends look at it.

702
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:32,004
- And that's why you favor Tony Uncle Al?
- In those 17 years, I did so good.

703
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,175
He... He lost his wife, his daughter.

704
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,054
No wonder
you're having anxiety attacks.

705
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,931
Yeah.

706
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,141
Maybe if you came clean with him.

707
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,065
Yeah, well, yeah.

708
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,694
- You okay?
- Yeah.

709
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,075
Go on... Go on... Go on with
what you were saying.

710
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,327
- Are you having an attack now?
- No.

711
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,872
No, I had a huge lunch,
that's all. It's... It's gas.

712
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,332
What is it, Anthony?

713
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,337
- Anthony?
- All right, the night he got pinched...

714
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,049
...I had a fucking panic attack, all right?
From my mother, goddamn it.

715
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,219
- I didn't even know what it was then!
- All right, just relax.

716
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,514
Focus on your breathing. Slowly.

717
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,519
It's not that, I just... I just need
some fucking Beano or something.

718
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,856
No, just, please, focus.

719
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,693
I've got my medical bag, in case.

720
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,783
Black guys. My ass.

721
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,789
I had a fight with my mother
and I had a fucking panic attack!

722
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,916
Okay, forget that for now.

723
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,131
Carmela was supposed to come over
with some fucking yarn...

724
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,426
...for some booties
my mother was making Meadow.

725
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,804
She was late.

726
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,056
What the fuck? Why go into it?

727
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:10,227
Close your eyes.
Focus on your breathing.

728
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:21,197
- You want some water?
- She was carrying on.

729
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,704
I said to her, I said,
"Carmela loves you.

730
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,707
You know, you gotta understand it,
she's got a 3-month-old."

731
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:39,673
And she kept fucking... She kept going.
I... I started screaming at her. So I left.

732
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,052
I walked out the door, I went over
to the car, I opened the door:

733
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,889
- Cut my fucking head open.
- And your cousin doesn't know this?

734
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,977
No, I lied. What am I gonna tell him?
What am I gonna tell all of them?

735
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,483
I had a fight with my mother, I fainted?
That's why I missed the job.

736
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,451
Jesus fucking Christ!

737
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,081
That's a lot to get off your chest.

738
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:18,254
I thought I was smart, and that's why
I bumped him up and protect him.

739
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:25,386
Turns out I'm just a fucking robot
to my own pussy-ass weakness.

740
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,180
He's also a capable person.

741
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,810
You okay?

742
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:39,483
You know, sometimes what happens
in here is like taking a shit.

743
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,902
Yes, okay.

744
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:47,032
Although I prefer to think of it
more like childbirth.

745
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,076
Trust me...

746
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,704
...it's like taking a shit.

747
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,604
- Hello?
- Mom? I'm engaged.

748
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,774
- What?
- Finn proposed. We're getting married.

749
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,442
Are you sure? Ca...

750
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:07,029
I mean, that's wonderful, honey.
I'm just so surprised.

751
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,282
He's gonna finish dental school,
though, right?

752
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,035
We're both finishing school.
We're not getting married...

753
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,496
...till we have our degrees.
This is so exciting.

754
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,790
I can't wait
for you to meet his parents.

755
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,541
Well, we'll have to have a party.

756
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,544
He's using his graduation present
to buy me a ring.

757
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,756
That is so sweet.

758
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,175
I told him he shouldn't.

759
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,139
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry.
- Yeah.
