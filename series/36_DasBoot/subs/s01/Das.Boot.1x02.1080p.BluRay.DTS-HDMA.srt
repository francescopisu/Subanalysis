1
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,521
- Permission to come up.
- Yes.

2
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,321
Morning.

3
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,001
Aircraft closing, 1-7-0.

4
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,201
Alarm!

5
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,641
Move it, gangway.

6
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,721
Stay down. Move it.

7
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,961
Out of the way.
Slow down.

8
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,721
Watch out.

9
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,401
Watch it.

10
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,801
- Upper deck secured.
- Upper deck secured.

11
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,641
Flood buoyancy tanks.

12
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,081
Take her down, 60 metres.

13
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:17,041
I'm sure it came from the port side,
out of the sun. Not identified.

14
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:04,561
These fliers they send out sure take
some chances, you must admit.

15
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,121
Up there alone
in their ancient machines...

16
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,881
...waiting to swoop down on their prey.

17
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,161
Bombs could be dumped anywhere.
Who would see it?

18
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:23,521
Our loving Lord?

19
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:31,001
Our loving Lord sees everything.

20
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,041
Sheer luck he didn't see us.

21
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,401
Or was it a sea gull, huh?

22
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:55,601
Difficult to see when
they fly at you out of the sun.

23
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,161
Well, Dufte, well.

24
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,481
We'll surface in five minutes.

25
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,601
It can happen to anyone.

26
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,281
Stand by to surface.

27
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,601
<i>The days tracked by in endless
succession. On watch or off.</i>

28
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,361
<i>Nothing ever happens.</i>

29
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:32,601
<i>There's only one sound
that fascinates us more and more.</i>

30
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,881
<i>The chirping of Morse code
from the hydrophone.</i>

31
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,841
<i>Very laboriously,
the decoding machine converts...</i>

32
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,521
<i>...a meaningless jumble
of letters into a message.</i>

33
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,241
<i>But is it for us?</i>

34
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,161
Well?

35
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,921
Nope.

36
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,081
Nothing for us.

37
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:22,521
<i>The line that records
our course zigzags...</i>

38
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:26,561
<i>...like a frightened hare
across the chart.</i>

39
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,321
<i>The routine never changes.</i>

40
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:33,201
<i>Day in, day out, always the same.</i>

41
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:38,921
<i>Every day, the same routine,
on watch and off watch.</i>

42
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:44,721
<i>Everywhere you smell the acrid stench
of oil, sweat, bilge and damp clothing.</i>

43
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,761
Morning, sir.

44
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,601
Morning's great.

45
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,121
Twenty minutes to go, lieutenant.

46
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:54,001
Don't waste, peel thinner.
Orders from the top.

47
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:57,241
More coffee over here.

48
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,161
<i>It's just before midnight.</i>

49
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,241
<i>First watch is standing by
to go on top.</i>

50
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,601
<i>To get their eyes used
to the darkness...</i>

51
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,041
<i>...the control room has
switched to red lights.</i>

52
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,521
- Watch out
- Goddamn!

53
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,401
- I have coffee all over me.
- Uneasy times, huh?

54
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,321
Pass the towel.

55
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,961
The captain, funny guy, isn't he?

56
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,801
He's reading his letters again.

57
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,921
What kind of letters?

58
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,761
Love letters.

59
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,841
He's got himself engaged
to this Nazi chick.

60
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,281
Flier's widow.

61
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,801
Nazi chick?

62
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:55,361
They say they're great fucks.

63
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,441
What do you mean?

64
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:04,641
They teach the girls at the
Reich school special techniques.

65
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,241
Such as?

66
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:12,001
They stick chalk in their asses and
write on the chalkboard, "Otto, Otto."

67
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,001
It's true.
That's why they're so flexible.

68
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,081
- Morning, men.
- Morning, lieutenant.

69
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,721
<i>Ocean, nothing but the ocean.</i>

70
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,241
<i>Not a sign of the enemy.</i>

71
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,801
<i>Just grubby necks, torn shirts,
sweaty blankets...</i>

72
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,921
<i>...and worst of all,
our own miserable faces.</i>

73
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,641
Lousy fog.

74
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,001
Lousy weather.

75
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,721
Lousy damn patrol.

76
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:56,081
None of our folks back home
know where we are.

77
00:10:56,481 --> 00:11:00,121
No mail, contact forbidden, nothing.

78
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:04,881
I guess when we're sunk,
we're reported missing, some month later.

79
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,641
Married yet, Kriechbaum?

80
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:25,281
I didn't waste any time, eh?

81
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,561
We're working on the fifth one.

82
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:48,921
Johann, it's good for you, fresh air.

83
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,081
No.

84
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:58,561
They're strange,
these machine-room people.

85
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,161
"Aid to cleanliness," four letters.

86
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,961
Bath.

87
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,721
Thank you.

88
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:47,321
"Deep affection," four letters.

89
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:51,881
Love.

90
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,801
Perfect.

91
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:07,321
Intellectual starvation, I would say.

92
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,441
Signal decoder.

93
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,121
One moment.

94
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:05,361
Five, six, seven, eight.

95
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:12,001
New course, sir?

96
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,961
One minute.

97
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,801
Can I see the radiogram?

98
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:36,881
Convoy Square at AK 2246.
Mean course, 60 degrees.

99
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,601
Speed, 8 knots. U-boat 37.

100
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,561
U-boat 37, that's Martin's boat
moving in to attack.

101
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,521
Too far away. We'll never make it.

102
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,081
Damned!

103
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:00,961
When do we get some orders?

104
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,161
Well, Johann?

105
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,041
Captain.

106
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,601
What's up with the diesels?

107
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,201
The diesels seem satisfied, sir.

108
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,521
Satisfied and all full.

109
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,681
The chief is worried about
our fuel consumption.

110
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,161
The chief is a careful man.

111
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,601
What's your opinion?

112
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,841
The chief knows what's best.

113
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,401
Funny times, Johann.

114
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,481
To be careful means very little.

115
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,161
They need heroes...

116
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,161
...and they are not too particular.

117
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,041
They make use of a broken hero.

118
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,641
Like Thomsen.

119
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,281
Or a dead hero.

120
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,121
Like Kelsch.

121
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,281
A good seaman is also a careful
seaman, right Johann?

122
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:16,881
Says as much in naval regulations.
Isn't that so?

123
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,881
On these diesels,
you can depend, captain.

124
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:25,001
It's all right, Johann.

125
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,081
Excuse me.

126
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:42,001
For your journal?

127
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,241
- Yes, wonderful stuff.
- Let's see you work! The press is here.

128
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,721
This way a moment.
Yes, wonderful.

129
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:53,001
So nicely greased with Vaseline now.
Come on. We're ready to ram it in!

130
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,481
Don't let me disturb you.
Carry on working.

131
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,681
Can I just bring you around this way?
Yes, good.

132
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:04,001
- Yes. Yes.
- Quick! Quick! Move it!

133
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,961
Yes, this is great.

134
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:10,721
Can you go this way?
Can I take this?

135
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,841
Good. Let's have some again with--

136
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,041
Who did that?

137
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:33,721
Who did that?!

138
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,481
Apply compressed air.

139
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,001
<i>The worst day since we shipped out.</i>

140
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,041
<i>We avoid talking to each other.</i>

141
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,521
<i>We avoid each other like lepers.</i>

142
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,441
Oh, my God, what a useless yo-yo!

143
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,041
At least she had a real nice shape.

144
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:30,121
Must make the best of what's there.

145
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,721
She hasn't got a friend.
The girl's not a dame, huh?

146
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,521
Hey.

147
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:44,201
The exhaust doors, to countersink,
I'll never forget that again.

148
00:20:56,241 --> 00:21:00,321
I remember a day in Paris,
in a bistro.

149
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:10,881
Good, what is it? Is it real sexy?

150
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:12,881
Let's have it.

151
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,801
There is this black guy
with that blond girl.

152
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:25,041
And she's playing with him
under the table.

153
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:29,041
They are not shy about that at all.

154
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,801
Those sluts in Paris.

155
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,561
Me neither, man.

156
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:40,721
Then he starts moaning,
rolls his eyes...

157
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,561
...I check underneath the table...

158
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,841
...and see him come...

159
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,441
...and it lands on my shoes.

160
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,281
That's still better than in your coffee.

161
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,601
- Mine is warm.
- They might relieve us sooner.

162
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:07,121
- It's always the same.
- They always turn up late.

163
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,721
Hey, watch out, man.

164
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:26,001
<i>Nothing is happening. Nothing.</i>

165
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,441
<i>We are sailing in limbo.</i>

166
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,681
<i>The silence on board
is like the inside of a coffin.</i>

167
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,881
One goddamn toilet, and then
you have to share with this whore.

168
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:26,121
Where is our friend the Bible-thumper
coming from, Schwalle?

169
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,961
He's a church berger.

170
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,601
Must be a pretty good place, huh,
Schwalle.

171
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:39,841
They raise the afterbirths and
chuck the babies in the garbage dump.

172
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:47,441
Hey, friend...

173
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:53,001
...what chapter is it today,
Lord, my host?

174
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,161
Shut your dirty mouth.

175
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:01,521
- Shut up, huh? I'll shut your mouth.
- Leave me alone.

176
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,521
Gives me a bloody pain,
spouting this religious stuff.

177
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:09,801
Let him have his way, we'll be crawling
on both knees, singing and praying.

178
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:48,881
Tell me, now...

179
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,241
...you got any hairs up your nose?

180
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:56,841
- Why?
- I've got some up my ass.

181
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,721
Maybe we could knit them together.

182
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:11,561
Françoise, my love...

183
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:15,401
...this is my 14th letter,
but you've yet to see one.

184
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:28,481
20th day at sea.

185
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:32,721
Head foggy, limbs hurt, eyes burn.
It's all so crazy.

186
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:37,081
Inhale bad smells and produce
our own. What a madness.

187
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:40,281
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

188
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:41,761
Get topside.

189
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:46,081
Flood it!

190
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,921
All main vents open!

191
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,321
There's a shadow appearing starboard.

192
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:53,201
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Down 30 metres. Stern planes up.

193
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,801
Easy. Bow planes down 10.

194
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,121
Planes at zero.

195
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:01,481
Anything on the starboard beam?

196
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,881
Propeller sounds.

197
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,721
1-1-0 degrees.

198
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,841
Way aft of us.

199
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,681
Contact growing fainter.

200
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,521
Fading faster.

201
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,681
All right.

202
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,321
We'd better stay down now.

203
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:00,281
- Steer 1-2-0.
- Steer 1-2-0.

204
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:07,041
A lone ship travelling fast.

205
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,281
We have no chance
of getting her in this light.

206
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:12,481
Steady on 1-2-0, sir.

207
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:21,481
Stand by to take a reading.

208
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:52,041
"It's more than merely superficial
to take care...

209
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,321
...in dress and personal appearance.

210
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,361
It denotes that the inner man
is someone upstanding...

211
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,081
...and has a corresponding effect
on other people.

212
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,841
An officer should be
thoroughly unpretentious...

213
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:05,001
...in his dressing deportment.

214
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,401
This, regrettably,
is not always the case.

215
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,921
In the old days...

216
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:12,241
...young officers used to be treated
more indulgently in this respect.

217
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,761
Mindful that the German lieutenant
had always been prepared to die...

218
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,681
...in a pinch, his superiors..."

219
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:19,361
Comfortable, huh?

220
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,961
No mail, no telephone.

221
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,961
Well-ventilated boat.

222
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,761
Solid-wood panelling.

223
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,761
Free food too.

224
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,281
We're in clover here.

225
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:41,521
Like fresh horse droppings.

226
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,801
They're rolling in clover as well.

227
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,721
They've no need to work
to make a living.

228
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:52,801
They're even allowed to smoke.

229
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,961
"And when all that remains
in the gaze that they turn on him...

230
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:03,481
...is the age-old question that betokens
ultimate trust and confidence:

231
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,761
'Sir, where do you order us to die?'

232
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:11,481
A junior officer reaps the full fruits
of his labour as leader and educator...

233
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:14,401
...when given responsibility
for the training..."

234
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:18,401
U-boat special cocktail. Jealous?

235
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:31,121
Stop that!

236
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,881
"Our recent triumphs:

237
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:59,321
We dive to evade enemy aircraft.
Lost contact.

238
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,001
Dive to avoid destroyer.
Depth charge."

239
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:14,561
The British have stopped
making mistakes.

240
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:58,521
Cut off extra supply
of fuel to the engines!

241
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,401
- Torpedo rooms, carry out lateral--
- Come on!

242
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,561
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

243
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,761
I'll be in the engine room.

244
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,641
- 0-6-0.
- Check.

245
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,841
What's going on?

246
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:26,281
- Look out! Here we go, girls.
- What's happening?

247
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:29,961
It's U-32. She's spotted a British
convoy somewhere in our vicinity.

248
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,681
We should be there in 10 hours.

249
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,561
<i>- Now hear this.</i>
- Listen.

250
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:44,401
<i>U-32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.</i>

251
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:47,081
<i>Contact expected anytime
after 1800 hours. Over.</i>

252
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:52,881
Soon we'll get rid of these beauties.
They're all ready for blastoff.

253
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:57,481
Over 30 freighters!

254
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,441
Berthold has to wait till we arrive.

255
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:03,161
He followed the convoy
and keeps in contact with us.

256
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:09,801
For me,
it's the best craft afloat, the U-boat.

257
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,481
And sailing ships.

258
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,801
Skimming across the sea
like a bird on a wing.

259
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:18,761
I've sailed on a three-masted schooner.
Wonderful ship.

260
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:22,281
Lots of room. Hulls big as churches.

261
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:31,161
That's a fine way to waste fuel.

262
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,521
Lunatic.

263
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,641
Damn this weather!

264
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,681
Come on, give us another squirt.

265
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,921
Another two hours.

266
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:11,481
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

267
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:23,481
Maybe one of their destroyers
got him on the run.

268
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,841
On the alert these days, the British.

269
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,961
They keep their destroyers
well out of sight.

270
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:48,641
Very neat...

271
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:53,081
...deflect us from our course
before our boat is in range.

272
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,001
Or force us to dive.

273
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:03,601
Yeah, yeah, it's no submarine picnic,
let me tell you.

274
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,721
Damn this weather, damn it.

275
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,601
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

276
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:31,041
We should be well within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

277
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:36,241
Why haven't we heard from HQ?

278
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:44,761
Visibility is nil, sir! It's useless!

279
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:54,641
- Prepare to dive.
- Prepare to dive!

280
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:01,321
- Clear the bridge now!
- Shut it!

281
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:09,921
Diving positions! Stand by, main vents.

282
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,161
Bow planes up 10.

283
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,961
Stern down 5.

284
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:50,121
Bow planes zero.

285
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,161
Stern zero.

286
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,041
What's up? Why are we diving?

287
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:01,161
- Hydrophone check.
- What?

288
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:06,041
In bad weather, you are able
to hear more than see on the surface.

289
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:10,721
Stern planes up 5. Easy.
Both planes zero.

290
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,641
Can't you make a contact?

291
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:59,001
Nothing?

292
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:50,041
Captain. Captain. Here.

293
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:56,921
Contact bearing 0-6-0. Quite faint.

294
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:12,361
Depth charges.

295
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:18,281
They're blasting someone.

296
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:28,001
What's the bearing from us now?

297
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:36,521
Moving right 0-4-5 degrees.

298
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:39,561
Moving away from us.

299
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:49,641
- Surface! Steer 3-3-0.
- Steer 3-3-0.

300
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:52,161
Bow up 10, stern down 5.
All ahead two-thirds.

301
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:53,841
Note this in our logbook:

302
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,201
In spite of bad weather, decided
to commence operation. Moving in now.

303
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:59,001
Steady on 3-3-0, sir.

304
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:31,841
Damn the stinking weather!

305
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:35,801
- How does it look?
- One minute, captain.

306
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:40,521
We are here. The enemy should be here
if they haven't zigzagged.

307
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:45,561
Freighter on starboard bow!
Bearing 0-4-0.

308
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:54,961
They're over there! 0-4-0 and closing!

309
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:04,121
That's no freighter.

310
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,841
No, a destroyer.

311
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:13,521
Coming straight at us. Clear the bridge.

312
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,281
Take her down!

313
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,921
- Come to periscope depth.
- Come to periscope depth.

314
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:37,521
Bow planes up 10.

315
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,961
Both planes zero.

316
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,241
Stern down 5.

317
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:12,481
Come up.

318
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:36,841
- Stand by, battle stations.
- Stand by, battle stations.

319
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,561
- Stand by, battle stations.
<i>- Stand by, battle stations.</i>

320
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:41,801
Out of the way, damn it!

321
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,481
Gangway!

322
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,561
Make way!

323
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:50,961
Go, go, go! Faster! Faster!
Hop, hop, hop!

324
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:00,361
Keep it level, chief.

325
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,801
Flood tubes one through four.

326
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:16,081
- Flood tubes one through four.
- Flood tubes one through four.

327
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:20,121
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

328
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,801
Tubes one through four, flooded.

329
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:26,401
Watch your depth, chief.

330
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:29,481
Bow planes up 2.
Stern planes down 2.

331
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:34,841
Come on.

332
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,281
Both planes come to zero.

333
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:41,121
13.5 metres.

334
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:47,761
- Open bow caps now.
- Open bow caps.

335
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:02,441
Enemy speed to 1-0.

336
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:05,521
Bow left. Bow angle 0-3-0.

337
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:07,841
Range, 6000.

338
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,801
Depth, 2 metres.

339
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:15,201
Torpedo speed, 4-0.
Spread shots from tubes one and three.

340
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:18,641
- Angle of spread, 3 degrees.
- Spread shot, tubes one and three.

341
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:21,121
Angle of spread, 3 degrees.

342
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:24,801
Tubes one through four
ready for submerged firing.

343
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,281
Damn it!

344
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:52,321
Damn it!

345
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:10,521
Close bow caps. Take her
deeper, chief! Take her deeper!

346
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,961
Depth charges dropped!

347
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,841
Depth charges!

348
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:36,041
Get some fuses, quick!

349
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,161
Check all hull valves and closures.

350
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,601
Control, all secure.

351
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:00,281
Forecastle clear.

352
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:06,601
No serious damage.

353
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:14,281
They must have spotted our periscope.

354
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:20,521
Seems incredible
with that sea condition.

355
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,961
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

356
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,641
Quiet!

357
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:48,601
Both planes steady at zero.
Level at 60 metres.

358
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:51,081
Is it getting louder?

359
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,241
Seems constant. Ahead of us.

360
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:01,641
2-8-0.

361
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:16,601
Two hundred and eighty...
Thirty-five...

362
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:25,961
Drawing further ahead, 2-9-5.

363
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,881
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder.

364
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,241
Rudder is left full, sir.

365
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,321
Steer due north.

366
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,321
- Deeper, chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

367
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,721
Pump 200 litres forward.

368
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:48,361
All ahead one-third.

369
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:52,601
200 metres forward, chief.

370
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:56,681
Both main motors indicate
ahead one-third.

371
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,921
Now it gets psychological, friends.
