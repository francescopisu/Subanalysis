2
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,649
Less than 20% are comfortable

3
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,484
with a president and a vice president
being related in any way.

4
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,988
Less than 10% approve of someone
who's never held elected office.

5
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,365
- But if we can move the needle...
- Forty points?

6
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,700
It's how we frame it.

7
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,036
Her favorables are decent.
They're better than mine.

8
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,830
In a void, but when it comes to her time
as the UN ambassador,

9
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,081
they fall off a cliff.

10
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,167
Performance and experience
are big factors.

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,128
Then we have to amplify her strengths,
not her weaknesses.

12
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,298
We're looking for a VP who's an asset.
This research proves she isn't.

13
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,551
Your job is not to dissuade me,
but to figure out how we sell it.

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,638
Sir, there are so many people
to choose from.

15
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,722
If the goal is to win,

16
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,598
- and we're bending over backwards--
- Seth.

17
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,937
The president asked us to develop a plan,
so that's what we'll do.

18
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,274
I'll meet you in my office.

19
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,285
- You know he's right.
- Well, of course he's right.

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
Maybe we offer something else.

21
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,208
She won't listen.

22
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,963
What about LeAnn?

23
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,132
Yes, I was thinking that, too.

24
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,635
Question is how to co-opt her.

25
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,888
She likes paychecks.

26
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,557
No, it's gotta be more than money.
She wants coattails.

27
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,565
We swap Claire's for mine.

28
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,318
- Campaign manager?
- We could use some fresh blood.

29
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,528
That I agree with, but LeAnn?

30
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,114
I mean, there's no guarantee
that we can control her.

31
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,949
Yeah, but if she can convince
Claire to change her mind,

32
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,492
that's all I need.

33
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,786
Yes.

34
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,704
<i>They're ready for you
in the Situation Room, sir.</i>

35
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,289
I'll be right there.

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,251
You could work with her if you had to.

37
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,753
I don't have to like her to work with her.

38
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,546
- Good, make the call.
- You still want Seth on the plan?

39
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,633
Yes, until LeAnn's on board.
Do I have to worry about him?

40
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,636
We dug pretty deep.
Nothing in his emails or phone records.

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,596
He's smart enough
to cover his tracks.

42
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,807
I'll talk to him.

43
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,916
- What do you think of this painting?
- I'm not sure.

44
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,337
Walker and I sat here one night,
stared up at a painting,

45
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,842
the blue one that's in the Oval now.
They replaced it with this.

46
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,635
That's not the American flag.

47
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,141
No, it's the rebel flag...
sinking into oblivion.

48
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,893
Is that a lightning bolt?

49
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,564
Oh, I assume...

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,572
Unless it's just a bad attempt
at making the ship a unicorn.

51
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,532
Do you see that?

52
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,367
Colors are nice.

53
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,660
I hate it.

54
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,580
I guess I hate it, too.

55
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,834
I suppose it's not a good idea to have

56
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,169
the Confederate flag
hanging here in the White House

57
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,255
after everything that's happened
in South Carolina.

58
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,174
Even if it is sinking.

59
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,635
What do you think we should put up?

60
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,388
I don't know.
Something you like better.

61
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,020
Do you have that marker
I sign things with?

62
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,738
Put your hand up on the wall.

63
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,824
- Sir?
- Put it on the wall.

64
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,215
Spread your fingers a little bit.

65
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,558
Wait.
Okay.

66
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah... That's enough fun for today.

67
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,993
Doug, I don't know how to do
what he's asking me to do.

68
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,828
- There is not some magical--
- The leaks.

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,375
- Was it you?
- Are you serious?

70
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,002
Very.

71
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,380
I handed over all of my correspondence,
just like everyone else.

72
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,299
Doesn't prove anything.

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,135
I'm trying to save this campaign.

74
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,679
If I wanted to sabotage it,
I'd let the president do it himself,

75
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,306
instead of fighting back
on this VP thing.

76
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,807
Or that's just a cover.

77
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,726
I've been in the trenches
for the past year

78
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,521
while you've been gone,
and now you doubt me?

79
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,814
I don't need this.

80
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,900
You got this job by digging up dirt.

81
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,863
If you can't trust me by now,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

82
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,283
Are you saying you wanna resign?

83
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,785
That is the last thing that I want,

84
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,330
but you're not giving me
any incentive to stay.

85
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,379
All right.
Fuck it.

86
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,971
Seth, I'm choosing
to believe you right now,

87
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,763
but if I come to regret that decision--

88
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,977
You won't, because it's not me.
I still think it could be Meechum.

89
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,519
It wasn't.

90
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,646
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

91
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,107
And so is the president.

92
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,151
May I go?

93
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,820
Or did you want to discuss
the plan for the First Lady?

94
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,992
I have some calls to make.
I'll come to your office after.

95
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,459
Get me LeAnn Harvey.

96
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,755
Milkin will be staying
with this man, Anton Khalski.

97
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:48,718
He owned the second-largest bank in Russia
until Petrov seized it in 2013.

98
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,429
Khalski fled across the border to Estonia.

99
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,516
We'll have Milkin's plane fly to Tallinn,

100
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,520
then he'll travel by boat
to Khalski's summer house on Saaremaa.

101
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,023
Tomorrow we'll unfreeze
Milkin's American assets

102
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,941
and transfer them
to Khalski's Swiss accounts.

103
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,403
Khalski will reach out
to his Russian military friends

104
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,113
and then start buying them off.

105
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,198
Are the FSB monitoring Khalski?

106
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,284
Closely.
They'll know we're behind this.

107
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,661
- When Moscow confronts us?
- We'll deny, of course.

108
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,621
Are we prepared if Petrov overreacts?

109
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,416
The Sixth Fleet has a presence
near the Bosphorus,

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,168
we have patrols in the North Sea.

111
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,045
- Draft the order.
- Sir, if I may?

112
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,797
- Yeah, we've discussed this, Cathy.
- Yes, sir. I feel obligated

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,009
to raise my very strong objections.
The diplomatic cost to us--

114
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,343
If diplomacy were working,

115
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,471
we wouldn't have to consider
this course of action, would we?

116
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,517
- I've voiced my concerns.
- Thank you, everyone.

117
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,486
You're not going to surprise me
by putting the president on, are you?

118
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,406
<i>No, it's just us.
He filled me in, though,</i>

119
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>- on the First Lady's request.</i>
- And?

120
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,328
We wanna make you
campaign manager.

121
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,871
<i>Look at your email.</i>

122
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,545
<i>- What is this?</i>
- Our research.

123
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,591
- It all boils down to the same thing.
<i>- You ran a few polls, so what?</i>

124
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,469
- Focus groups, too.
- Meaningless.

125
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,720
<i>Not these numbers.</i>

126
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,431
Claire can't be on the ticket.
You know she can't.

127
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,267
<i>This isn't something
you can isolate on its own.</i>

128
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,936
<i>If gas prices hit $6 a gallon,
you're fucked.</i>

129
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,314
<i>- You lose every key demo.</i>
- We're well aware.

130
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,109
But if the president makes
Claire his running mate,

131
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,195
it makes the conversation
tactical instead of economic.

132
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,240
That buys you time on the Russia crisis.

133
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,283
You solve that,
confidence in the president

134
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,577
translates into confidence
in his choice--

135
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,331
I didn't call you to be convinced.
I called to offer you a job.

136
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,752
- Only to get to Mrs. Underwood.
- This isn't just about her.

137
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,215
We need you.
You'll turn this campaign around.

138
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,050
I'm surprised, Doug.
I didn't think you were very fond of me.

139
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,554
I'm fond of talent.
So is the president.

140
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,726
- My loyalty is to the First Lady.
- All I'm asking is that you talk to her.

141
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,811
I'll tell you what.
I'll show Claire your research

142
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,688
if you show the president mine.

143
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,691
I can agree to that.

144
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,486
I shouldn't even
be talking to you, Heather.

145
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,988
<i>I'm seriously concerned
that there's been an abuse of power.</i>

146
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,200
Madam Attorney General?
Mr. Stamper, um, is ready to see you now.

147
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,493
I'll be right there.

148
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,995
I gotta go.

149
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,957
The agent in charge of the operation
got a promotion directly after.

150
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,876
- Listen--
<i>- Martha, if the president,</i>

151
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,255
or one of his staff...
If anyone strong-armed the bureau

152
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,426
into pursuing Lucas Goodwin,
then you know that's an abuse of power.

153
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,052
I work for the president.

154
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,346
I am about to sit down
with his Chief of Staff.

155
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>- The law is the law.</i>
- This is politics, not the law.

156
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>Not true. You brought me on as
solicitor general because of my integrity.</i>

157
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,355
<i>I am bringing this to you
because of yours.</i>

158
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,690
Madam Attorney General.

159
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,277
I really need to go.

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,988
<i>- If a sliver of Goodwin's story holds up--</i>
- How did you even find this?

161
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,241
<i>Did your oppo team
speak to someone in WITSEC?</i>

162
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,661
Because if that's the case,
then that sort of breach is not--

163
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>- I spoke to him myself, personally.</i>
- You what?

164
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,544
He came to me.
He tracked me down.

165
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,379
I'm not touching this, Heather.

166
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
Doug, sorry about that.

167
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,301
- No--
- I was just on with the Chief Justice.

168
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,052
- Don't be silly, come on in.
- Thank you.

169
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,096
- This way.
- Thanks so much.

170
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>I don't know.
She didn't do that well as ambassador.</i>

171
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,854
<i>She wasn't experienced enough.</i>

172
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,898
<i>- Hold on, she was an ambassador?
- At the United Nations.</i>

173
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,066
<i>Chris, don't you watch the news?</i>

174
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>How many of you feel the same?</i>

175
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>Any other reasons,
besides lack of experience?</i>

176
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,828
<i>Well, she was really impulsive
when she had that outburst in Moscow.</i>

177
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,248
<i>Well, she never should've
been there in the first place.</i>

178
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,417
<i>I mean, the Senate voted her down,
and then her husband just appoints her?</i>

179
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,585
<i>That's not right.</i>

180
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,880
<i>Okay, see, I like her
as a person, but I agree,</i>

181
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,132
<i>she should stick to being First Lady.</i>

182
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,470
So, he's hoping
you'll convince me to let it go.

183
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,055
Look, I'd make a killing
compared to what you've paid me,

184
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,017
but you and I talked about
making a real mark.

185
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,153
My father really liked Francis.

186
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,408
But as my daddy, he said to me,
the day before we got married,

187
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,075
"You have one life, Claire.

188
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,289
Are you sure this is the man
you wanna spend it with?"

189
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,291
What did you say?

190
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,585
I said I didn't want
to live my life full of doubts.

191
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,171
Well, I think Francis
wants me to doubt myself.

192
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,719
- What was that?
- My mother... killing a lizard.

193
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,027
- I'll get the door for you, ma'am.
- I can open the door myself.

194
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,292
Watch your step.
There's blood on the floor.

195
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,803
I want you to take this
to the president, in person.

196
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,807
- Try to get on a plane tonight if you can.
- Of course.

197
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,028
This one's for you.

198
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,534
- It's warm.
- At least it's free.

199
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,955
I may need to cash in my insurance.

200
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,708
What's going on?

201
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,713
Tell me what my position would be
if she wins the nomination.

202
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,173
Is it the attorney general?

203
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,886
- The what?
- Never mind.

204
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,262
For running mate?

205
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,306
It's way too early for running mates.
He hasn't even won.

206
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,852
- Are we talking about the same thing?
- You go first.

207
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,272
- Uh-uh. It doesn't work that way.
- Well, you're the one looking for a job.

208
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,607
You can either involve me,

209
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,568
or you can start reading headlines
about Dunbar pushing a marriage story.

210
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,154
That would blow you up.

211
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,866
Doug's already suspicious.
I've got nothing to lose.

212
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,493
So which is it?

213
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,746
Lucas Goodwin.

214
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,500
He was an editor... at <i>The Herald,</i>
the one who--

215
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,044
- We spoke to him.
- Isn't he in prison?

216
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,505
Not anymore.

217
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,596
He's scheduled to depart
at 0930 hours.

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,307
That'll put him in Tallinn
shortly before dawn.

219
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,477
Our station chief is standing by
with the escort to Saaremaa.

220
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,479
This is the executive order.

221
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,525
- Sir--
- Cathy, I've made my decision.

222
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,069
- Hourly updates once he lands.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,863
Thank you all very much.

224
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,701
Tell Doug I'm ready.

225
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,208
Please, have a seat, LeAnn.

226
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,338
I'm delighted you've agreed
to come on board.

227
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,466
It's my understanding
there is a condition attached.

228
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,717
Well, yes.

229
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,554
And she understands that condition?
You've spoken with her?

230
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,639
Oh, my apologies, sir.
I wasn't clear.

231
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,225
I meant our condition, not yours.

232
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,206
On Super Tuesday.

233
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,630
It's a long trip
to deliver this in person.

234
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,634
Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd want to end up in the wrong hands.

235
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:16,225
- Are you staying here in Washington?
- No, I'm going straight back.

236
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,728
Is there anything you'd like me
to tell the First Lady?

237
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,355
Tell her she'll have her answer
by this evening.

238
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,610
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Have a safe trip back, Ms. Harvey.

239
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,781
I'll show myself out.

240
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,749
<i>For quite some time, the
president and I have been growing apart.</i>

241
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,042
Have Meechum step in here.

242
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,877
<i>We've attempted
to save our marriage,</i>

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,755
<i>but after great effort,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

244
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,464
<i>that it can't be saved.</i>

245
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>It is with great regret
that I announce today</i>

246
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,345
<i>I'm filing for divorce.</i>

247
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,432
- We have to stop her.
- Before she gets to the airport?

248
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,184
No, I mean Claire.

249
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,187
You asked for me, sir?

250
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,565
Come in.

251
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,072
Both the cell and the landline--

252
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,199
We're on lockdown, ma'am.
We had to scramble all the--

253
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,076
Lockdown?
What are you talking about?

254
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,953
I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.

255
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,246
- What--
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

256
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,040
You can't force me to stay in here.

257
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,500
There is a current, highly credible
threat to your life--

258
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,919
I need to speak to your supervising--

259
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,755
I am the head of your detail
here in Dallas, ma'am,

260
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,507
and I've been ordered
to keep you securely in this house.

261
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,041
Go Underwood!

262
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,171
Listen.

263
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,593
Blunderwood!
Blunderwood!

264
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,971
Do you know what they're chanting?
"Blunderwood."

265
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,349
And if I were their English professor,

266
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,559
why, I would give them all
an "A" for cleverness...

267
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,855
...but a "D" for accuracy.

268
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,109
But that's part of being president.

269
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,736
You make enemies,

270
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,864
and you can hear some of mine
just outside, right now.

271
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,700
So, I am grateful
to each and every one of you

272
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,368
for coming out and showing
your support today.

273
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,204
It's because of you
we will win this nomination,

274
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,082
and that's why I came
to your college today.

275
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,301
Now, of course, I knew that there
would be protesters here today...

276
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,220
and I could've chosen not to come,

277
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,265
or I could choose
to avoid them as I leave,

278
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,474
but I'm not going to do that,

279
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,895
because those students out there,
your fellow classmates,

280
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm their president, too.

281
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:12,193
And whether they vote for me or not,
I have to lead them as well.

282
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,947
So, it's important to hear them,
to talk to them,

283
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,240
to listen to their ideas,

284
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,077
because, just as you're learning
in college,

285
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,580
a diversity of ideas makes us all wiser,

286
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,084
and that holds true
even for your president.

287
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,379
True leadership is not running away
from those who disagree with you,

288
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,840
but embracing them,

289
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,258
and that is exactly what I intend to do
when I'm done today.

290
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,678
I'm gonna go out
and embrace that entire crowd.

291
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,527
- Shouldn't we be taking a military plane?
- That would draw attention.

292
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,738
Relax.

293
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,615
Everything's been worked out.
You're in good hands.

294
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,244
Here, get some sleep.

295
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,330
It's gonna be a long trip tonight.

296
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,847
Blunderwood! Blunderwood!

297
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,933
- Any news?
- Everything's secure, sir.

298
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,978
We love you, Underwood!

299
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,731
Thank you all for coming out,

300
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,358
even those of you
who don't entirely support me.

301
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,611
- Way to go, Mr. President!
- Thank you.

302
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,073
I wanna try to hear what it is
that you disagree with me about.

303
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,367
I understand not everyone's for me.

304
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,538
- No more wars!
- Go back to Gaffney!

305
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,916
Hello, how are you?
Thank you for coming out.

306
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,292
Hello, thank you for coming out.

307
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,710
- You're doing a great job!
- We know what you are!

308
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,462
Hello.

309
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,340
All right,
I'm here to try to listen to you,

310
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,302
but probably one at a time
is gonna be a little better.

311
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,513
Okay, maybe we could have a conversation,
more one-on-one.

312
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,015
It's difficult to hear you.

313
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,935
I understand what you don't believe in,
but what are you for?

314
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,853
That would be a good question.
All right, how about you?

315
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,521
You've been yelling at me
for a little while.

316
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,065
What do you think
I should be doing differently?

317
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,441
- You should resign.
- Well, now,

318
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,818
I'm not asking for your vote,

319
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,903
but what would you do
if you were president?

320
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,654
You're ruining our country!

321
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,739
I came out here to try to listen
to what you wanna say,

322
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,408
but if all you're gonna do is scream--

323
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,910
Gun!

324
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,170
Let's go! Let's go!

325
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,297
- Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

326
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,184
<i>There has been an attempted
assassination of the president.</i>

327
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,395
<i>President Frank Underwood has been shot.</i>

328
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,733
<i>It occurred about ten minutes ago
during a campaign event</i>

329
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,902
<i>at Hammond University
in Washington, D.C.</i>

330
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,031
<i>We do not yet know how severely
the president has been wounded.</i>

331
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,909
<i>He is en route
to Jefferson Memorial Hospital.</i>

332
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>We don't know how serious
his condition may be.</i>

333
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,666
<i>Footage of the assassination attempt
is still making its way to us,</i>

334
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>and we expect to have that shortly.</i>

335
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,965
<i>Witnesses are reporting that there was
a quick succession of gunshots,</i>

336
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>four or five,</i>

337
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,220
<i>a lone gunman whose identity
we are still trying to determine.</i>

338
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,597
<i>We've been told the gunman was killed,</i>

339
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,682
<i>as well as at least one
Secret Service agent,</i>

340
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>but we don't have
definitive confirmation of that yet.</i>

341
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,565
<i>We don't yet know who the gunman
may be or who the agent is.</i>

342
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,859
- What's happened?
- The president's been shot.

343
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,570
<i>I'm hearing now
that the president</i>

344
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,740
<i>received at least one gunshot
to the abdomen, possibly more,</i>

345
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,161
<i>that he clutched his stomach,
that he fell instantly to the ground,</i>

346
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,163
<i>and there were screams,
people panicking,</i>

347
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,082
<i>that it has been very chaotic
at that scene.</i>

348
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,168
<i>We have very little information
at this time,</i>

349
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,546
<i>other than shots were fired,
the president wounded.</i>

350
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,673
<i>But as I say, he is alive.</i>

351
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>We've gotten no official statement
from the White House as of yet,</i>

352
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,970
<i>either the president's precise condition</i>

353
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,057
<i>or the whereabouts
of Vice President Blythe.</i>

354
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,851
<i>He is believed to be at the White House.
We cannot confirm that,</i>

355
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,896
<i>nor do we know if he will
take over as acting president,</i>

356
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,191
<i>assuming the duties of the presidency</i>

357
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,902
<i>under the terms of the 25th Amendment
to the Constitution.</i>

358
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,988
<i>That would seem likely, however,</i>

359
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:30,034
<i>if the president's wounds are
as serious as we believe them to be.</i>

360
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,995
<i>This is a difficult moment
for the country.</i>

361
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,914
<i>It is not the first time
that a president has been shot</i>

362
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,210
<i>in my lifetime or in many of yours.</i>

363
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,213
<i>But even for those of us
who have experienced this before,</i>

364
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,757
<i>it is no less of a shock,
it is no less terrifying.</i>

365
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,720
<i>It is the moment
when our nation's resilience,</i>

366
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,347
<i>when our collective strength,</i>

367
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,434
<i>the moment when all of that
is tested the most.</i>

368
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,064
<i>And we can only imagine how difficult
it must be for the First Lady.</i>

369
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,864
- Francis--
- Michael told me.

370
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,704
I have to go back to Washington.

371
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,708
Well, what are you waiting for?

372
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,047
Do you expect me to console you?

373
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,217
No, I just...

374
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,721
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Claire.

375
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,183
I hope he dies.

376
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,986
Claire, I can't imagine
how difficult this must be.

377
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,696
Is there anything I can do?

378
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,657
I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President,

379
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,035
but I'm sure you've got
a lot to take care of right now.

380
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,913
<i>- Is there anything I can do to help you?</i>
- I'll be making a brief appearance

381
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,043
once we have a better sense of...
where things stand.

382
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,086
Would you like me to be there?

383
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,423
I think it would be good,
the country seeing the First Lady.

384
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,260
<i>I think it's more important
that they see your steady hand.</i>

385
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,805
If you're by my side,
it would certainly make it steadier.

386
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,724
Of course. Anything you ask.

387
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,353
<i>I'm gonna be praying for you.
For both of you.</i>

388
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,979
<i>Thank you, Don.</i>

389
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,407
Okay.

390
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,919
This way, sir.

391
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,713
Thank you, sir.

392
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,635
The acting president needs to be briefed
on a highly classified matter.

393
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,970
Everyone without military clearance,
we'll need the room.

394
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,108
<i>It was in fact two shots.</i>

395
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,695
<i>One that grazed the torso
just beneath the right arm</i>

396
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,783
<i>and the second which entered the abdomen,
possibly into his liver.</i>

397
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,287
<i>Obviously, it was that shot
that did the greatest damage.</i>

398
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,582
<i>The president is currently
reported to be in critical condition.</i>

399
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,958
<i>The Secret Service agent</i>

400
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,920
<i>that was killed protecting the president
was Edward Meechum.</i>

401
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,674
<i>He is the head of the president's detail,
and we can confirm that now.</i>

402
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,677
<i>After being shot and before he died,</i>

403
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,182
<i>he killed the assailant
whose identity is still unknown.</i>

404
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,475
<i>We're waiting now on a press conference
from the White House</i>

405
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,893
<i>from Press Secretary Seth Grayson,</i>

406
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,814
<i>and we expect to have that
beginning in just a few moments.</i>

407
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,818
We confirm nothing unless
you run it past me twice first,

408
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,027
- I don't want--
- Mr. Grayson...

409
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm on my way.
We don't want any rumors, only facts.

410
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,824
There's a student who's claiming
it was the Secret Service

411
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,034
- who fired the first shot.
- What did I just say?

412
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,413
- Do not waste my time with that bullshit.
- Sir, the press is waiting.

413
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,415
All right, I'm... I'm coming.
Uh, where's my...

414
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,799
At 12:38 this afternoon,
Vice President Donald Blythe

415
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,260
was authorized as acting president
by the cabinet.

416
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,554
He is currently meeting with them.

417
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,849
Approximately 20 minutes ago,
the First Lady landed at Andrews.

418
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,685
<i>She is expected to arrive
at the hospital shortly.</i>

419
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,942
- Mrs. Underwood.
- How is he?

420
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,695
They're still in the OR.
Probably a few hours left to go.

421
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,449
Is he going to live?

422
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,827
He took a direct hit to his liver,
which is partially shattered.

423
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,205
Fortunately, part of the left lobe
is mostly intact.

424
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,710
Now, we think there's a decent chance
he will survive surgery,

425
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,339
but even if he does,
that's when the real fight begins.

426
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,384
I'd like to see him.

427
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,969
As soon as he's out,
I'll make sure you know.

428
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,638
Okay, thank you.

429
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:08,204
I'd recommend we call off this operation,
we turn the plane around now.

430
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,583
I disagree. It's well planned.
The president already signed off.

431
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,294
The president might die.

432
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,506
- Madam Secretary...
- We'll have no talk like that, Cathy.

433
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,633
My apologies, sir.

434
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:24,763
What I am trying to say is that
it is too risky to antagonize--

435
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,723
The point was to scare them,
not--

436
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,727
To do anything of this nature while
the commander in chief is incapacitated,

437
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,438
- the Russians will take--
- We're at high alert.

438
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,356
We're prepared for all eventualities.

439
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,191
We don't want the military
to be the fail-safe here.

440
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,445
Mr. Vice...
Mr. President...

441
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,740
I believe it is our duty to carry out
the orders that the president signed.

442
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,869
- The circumstances have changed.
- The plan is sound.

443
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,166
So, what would you like to do, sir,
continue the mission or abort?

444
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:59,423
- Uh, I... I wanna think on it.
- He's scheduled to land in two hours.

445
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,008
I just want...

446
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,678
I've gotta think.
Let's take a break.

447
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,389
I, uh, I need to process all this.

448
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,817
Sir?

449
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,615
- The president weighed everything--
- Cathy brought up some good points.

450
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,492
She's been against this
from the very beginning,

451
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,828
- but the president clearly--
- Just give me some time, Doug, please?

452
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,331
I've got too many people
barking in my ear.

453
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,926
The president is out of surgery,

454
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,262
and he is in stable
but critical condition.

455
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,685
Excuse me! Excuse me!
We are going to keep this orderly.

456
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,562
Dr. Saxon will finish his statement,

457
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,023
and then we'll answer your questions.
Thank you.

458
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:02,569
The surgery lasted six hours, 28 minutes.
Three quarters of his liver was removed.

459
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,572
A liver, even one quarter of a liver,

460
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:09,034
has the ability to regenerate
within six to eight weeks.

461
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,828
We will be conducting
blood tests every hour.

462
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,080
Enzymes, ammonia levels, PT times,

463
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,207
I believe these are all
explained in the handout.

464
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,334
<i>...the medical report,
live from the White House,</i>

465
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>which we will return to shortly.</i>

466
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,213
<i>But we have breaking news we're following.</i>

467
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,966
<i>The would-be assassin
was previously reported</i>

468
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,886
<i>as John Carlyle from Dayton, Ohio,</i>

469
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,264
<i>but sources in the Department of Justice
now say this was actually</i>

470
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:35,602
<i>an alias for Lucas Goodwin,</i>
<i>a former editor at</i> The Washington Herald

471
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:39,481
<i>who was convicted of cyberterrorism
nearly two years ago.</i>

472
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,151
<i>Now, if we freeze this cell phone footage
of the shooting</i>

473
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,489
<i>and we compare the shooter's face
to this picture of Goodwin...</i>

474
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,866
<i>well, the comparison is striking</i>

475
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,496
<i>and would seem to confirm what we're
hearing from our sources in the DOJ,</i>

476
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,250
<i>who say Goodwin was recently released
and is in a witness protection program.</i>

477
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,088
It's so strange to think that I--

478
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,174
It was, what?
Just two hours before? Less than.

479
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,177
How did he react?

480
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,514
<i>He was cold, I guess.
I couldn't really read him.</i>

481
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,684
He looks so weak.

482
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,396
- Should I come back to Washington?
<i>- Let's see how the next couple of days go.</i>

483
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,900
Well, just say the word,
I'm on a plane.

484
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,529
All right, thank you, LeAnn.
Good night.

485
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,947
<i>Good night.</i>

486
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,371
Francis, can you hear me?

487
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,007
Francis.

488
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:57,476
I just spoke to Eddie's parents, ma'am.
You said you wanted to call them?

489
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,102
Yes, thank you.

490
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,693
Edward was more than a hero, Mrs. Meechum.
He was our friend.

491
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,738
I'm so sorry for your loss.

492
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,037
Please, let me know if there's anything
I can do for you and your family.

493
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,080
You can call me anytime.

494
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:24,628
Yes, ma'am, that is my private number.
And again, I'm so sorry.

495
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,681
- Lucas Goodwin?
- We didn't know he was out.

496
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,891
How can that happen?
He's released and you didn't know--

497
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,310
Ma'am... as far as threats go,

498
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,604
we've been far more occupied
with you lately.

499
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,401
I'm hoping that we can work together,
because I need your help.

500
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,197
- How?
- The vice president.

501
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,908
We spoke.
I told him I would appear with him.

502
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,076
Not the statement.

503
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,245
He's having trouble making a decision.

504
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,957
Can you come back
to the White House with me?

505
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,046
It's serious, ma'am.
I can fill you in on the way.

506
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,552
I'll grab my things.

507
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,273
- I can't let you go any farther, sir.
- I'm his Chief of Staff.

508
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:31,402
I'm sorry, sir.
Only doctors and the First Lady for now.

509
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,720
Claire.

510
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
Hello.

511
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,601
How are you?

512
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,185
- Exhausted.
- I'm sure.

513
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,646
You must be, too.

514
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:10,233
There's so much I don't know.
It's... overwhelming.

515
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,528
Sir, I briefed the First Lady
on the Milkin operation.

516
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,738
I thought she might have some insight,

517
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,532
given her experience
working directly with Russia.

518
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,869
I know you've had a lot of people
weigh in already.

519
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:25,040
I value your input, Claire.
I'm glad you're here.

520
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,045
- Douglas, will you give us a minute?
- Of course.

521
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,755
I'll be with the cabinet, sir.

522
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,508
You know that thing that people say,

523
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,385
"God never gives you
more than you can handle"?

524
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,511
Yes.

525
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,389
My Marjory,
God bless her,

526
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,850
she said that was pure bullshit.

527
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,566
Oh, listen to me complaining while
your husband is fighting for his life.

528
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,194
Oh, it's okay.
Actually, I need the distraction.

529
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,071
Let's talk Russia.

530
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,992
I'm torn. Uh, we have this plane
circling over the North Sea...

531
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:05,038
- and I don't know what to do.
- Well, what does your gut tell you?

532
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,499
I've never been
a gut sort of guy.

533
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,378
I mean, if I had a gun to my head...

534
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:16,591
- Sorry, that was a poor choice of words.
- It's fine. Go on.

535
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,471
I understand what the president
hoped to achieve,

536
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,182
but the thought of provoking Russia...

537
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,520
And I'm just beginning to immerse myself
in all the complexities.

538
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,609
What would Frank do,
if he were in my shoes right now?

539
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,279
If he were here, he'd tell you that's
the last thing you should think about,

540
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,281
because he's not here, you are.

541
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,909
What would you do?

542
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,453
Proceed with the mission
or bring him back?

543
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,373
I don't like either.

544
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,917
Those are my options.

545
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,254
Well, if there's one thing I've learned,
28 years with Francis,

546
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,506
and he said it time and time again,

547
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,717
"If you don't like
the way the table is set..."

548
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,386
- "Then turn over the table."
- That's right.

549
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,554
He's said it to me,
more than once.

550
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,891
Then that's what you should do, Donald.

551
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,771
- But how?
- Well, let's figure it out.

552
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,495
Weren't we supposed
to have landed already?

553
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,166
- We're in a holding pattern.
- Why? Is something wrong?

554
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,959
All I know is we're in a holding pattern.

555
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,778
Doug.

556
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,824
This plane's gonna run out of fuel soon.
We're gonna have to put it down somewhere.

557
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,468
I'll be making a statement shortly.
Let's notify the press corps.

558
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,222
- About the operation?
- No, to reassure the American people.

559
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,100
- Shall I meet you in there?
- Ten minutes. The cabinet?

560
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,393
- Still waiting on your decision, sir.
- Good.

561
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,769
Let's go.

562
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,781
I want you to land the plane in China.

563
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,200
China, sir?

564
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,702
There's no bailout without Chinese money.

565
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,038
We give them Milkin,
they have more leverage.

566
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:54,499
Sir, that gives away our leverage.

567
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,376
I'm not for regime change,
but that just--

568
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,794
It's the last thing
that Petrov is expecting.

569
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,297
They'll demand drilling access
in eastern Siberia.

570
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,092
And when they do,
we become the lesser of two evils.

571
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,720
Sir, at no time did the president
intend on bringing China into the mix--

572
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,555
Get the plane on Chinese soil.

573
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,017
And turn over Milkin's assets.
That's my decision.

574
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,025
- I asked for your help.
- And that's what I gave.

575
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,985
No, China wasn't part
of the president's plan.

576
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,320
It's part of the acting president's plan.

577
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,282
- You ready?
- Yes, whenever you are.

578
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,617
- Seth?
- Yes, sir.

579
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the acting president.</i>

580
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,554
<i>Please, sit.</i>

581
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,476
<i>This is a difficult day for all Americans,</i>

582
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,440
<i>particularly for Mrs. Underwood,
who is gracious enough to be here,</i>

583
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,610
to lend me strength
while I address an anxious nation.

584
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,861
Mr. President!

585
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,572
Uh... uh--

586
00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:17,798
