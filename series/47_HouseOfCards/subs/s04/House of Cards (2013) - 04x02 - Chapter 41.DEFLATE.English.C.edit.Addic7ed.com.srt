2
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,778
He is a classless, graceless,
shameless barbarian.

3
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,571
What he did to you, Elizabeth,
it was disgusting.

4
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,240
- Awful.
- Just vile.

5
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,450
- Can you pass the plate of...
- Yeah.

6
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,827
But why didn't you tell us?

7
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,789
The thought of you fighting this alone,
all those years...

8
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,207
I didn't want pity.

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,626
Is it true that they were arguing?

10
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,962
No, she came down here to be with me.

11
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,382
Of course, we didn't expect that
it was gonna be made a public display.

12
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,845
I guess he thought that was
the best way to dispel the rumors.

13
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,056
That man does not deserve to be president.

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,100
I've never wanted
to speak ill of him, Elizabeth,

15
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,937
but when I think of the way
he's treated you and Claire...

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,439
Oh, stop now.
He is still her son-in-law.

17
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,524
No, Bar's right.

18
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,152
He doesn't deserve to be president.

19
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,364
You could... all help me, actually.

20
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,075
- Anything.
- Just say the word.

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,369
Heather Dunbar.

22
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,331
We should be supporting her.

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,375
With our checkbooks.

24
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,544
You really want him to lose?

25
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,631
When he loses,
Claire can begin her own career...

26
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,052
which is far more important to me.

27
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,555
I don't know if we can
really make a difference, but...

28
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,892
I'd rather do more than just
sit around and bad-mouth him.

29
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,936
So, we just write a check?

30
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,022
Now, Francis can't know.

31
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,986
I mean, our donations
will have to be... once removed.

32
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,159
That amendment
has stalled for years.

33
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,036
Because we didn't have someone
in Veterans Affairs.

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,288
It isn't a veterans issue.
It's public health.

35
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,539
That's not my specialty.

36
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,417
Wait, you're telling me you don't know
anyone who's had breast cancer?

37
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,170
I mean
in terms of legislation.

38
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,756
Fifty percent more.

39
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,050
That's how many more black women die
of breast cancer than white women.

40
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,137
In our district,
it's higher than the murder rate.

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,806
Help us get this clinic.

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,142
I don't deny that it's an important issue,

43
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,644
but I have to pick and choose
what I support.

44
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,856
You're in a tight race back home,
Congresswoman.

45
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,108
We'll set up a super PAC.

46
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,027
Three million dollars.

47
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,030
You did this
without talking to me?

48
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,740
Claire and I spoke at length, Mother.

49
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,824
Claire?

50
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,787
You're calling the First Lady
by her given name, now?

51
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,539
Well, and I would hope
you would, too, Congresswoman.

52
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,707
You went behind my back, Mrs. Underwood.

53
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm not asking for a full endorsement.

54
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,090
I'm just asking for your blessing
on Celia delaying her run.

55
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,136
And of course,
a promise to not campaign against me.

56
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,721
Jackie Sharp's big on Dunbar.

57
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,098
Why would she help you?

58
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,600
This money isn't directly linked to us.

59
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,897
You mean the president's comfortable
putting money in Jackie's war chest?

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,649
He is,
but we have to keep this quiet.

61
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,528
There can't be any communication
between your office and his.

62
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,161
- Speech?
- Seth put in your latest edits.

63
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,038
Once you approve,
we'll send it to the teleprompters.

64
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,999
- Has she arrived yet?
- A few minutes ago.

65
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,461
Please sit down.

66
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,924
If Jackie gets cold feet,
we can't leave her any choice.

67
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,051
I'm already on top of that.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,761
How?

69
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,850
They always use the same hotel.
I've got a guy set up across the street.

70
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,894
I'm assuming you're being careful.

71
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm not just a tech outfit.
I can go old school, too.

72
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,609
Ma'am?
We have lunch prepared for you.

73
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,906
This is impressive.

74
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,577
Well, soak it up while you can.
We won't be here long.

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,954
I'll be right back.

76
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,973
Anatoly Rostropov.
His empire's worth 30 billion.

77
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,849
Petrov had him killed last night.

78
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,894
Stanislav Ustravich,
founder of Turkas Oil.

79
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,771
Found dead early this morning.

80
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,691
Igor Milkin, media tycoon
worth 24 billion.

81
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,776
Very outspoken against Petrov

82
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,321
after the government seized
his TV stations and newspapers.

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,574
His private plane landed in Bangor, Maine,
two hours ago.

84
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,617
We've got him quarantined on the tarmac.

85
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,829
He's seeking political asylum.
Says he's in fear for his life.

86
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,958
We believe they've been
formulating a plan to unseat Petrov.

87
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,711
Brutus, Cassius,
and the one that got away.

88
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,339
Moscow's adamant
we send him back immediately.

89
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
Then send him back.

90
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,259
I don't want the State of the Union
overshadowed by some asylum dispute.

91
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,594
He's Petrov's problem, not ours.

92
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,098
Legally, sir, we are obligated
to process his asylum request.

93
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,641
- Don't tell me the press knows he's here.
- No, sir.

94
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,728
We jammed communications on his plane
as soon as it entered U.S. airspace.

95
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,313
Then we don't have a problem, do we?

96
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,232
It's likely he'll be killed
if we send him back.

97
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,817
So be it. He tried to slay a dragon
and he missed the mark.

98
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,901
Now he's gotta face the fire.

99
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,488
Our fear is more killings,
more company seizures.

100
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,491
That leads to a run on the banks,
collapse of the ruble, default on debts.

101
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,617
And we already know

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,370
he's been back-channeling
about a bailout with the IMF.

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,788
Well, if you have a proposal to make,
then make it quickly.

104
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,291
- I have a speech to prep for.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,213
Last year you wore the taupe,
so maybe this is too similar?

106
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,636
Come in.

107
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,265
I was able to get Mrs. Hale on the phone.

108
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,059
Oh, great. Uh, could you excuse me
for a moment?

109
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,900
- <i>Mother?</i>
- You doing okay, Mrs. Hale?

110
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,277
Yes, thank you.

111
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,113
<i>Who was that?</i>

112
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,283
Oh, um...

113
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,993
I'm treating myself to a pedicure.

114
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,954
Nobody can hear me.

115
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,956
You wanted to talk?

116
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,377
<i>Yes, I wanted to thank you,
for all of your help.</i>

117
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,297
Uh, it looks like the congresswoman
is leaning toward a yes.

118
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,716
<i>You know, I was thinking,
when you run,</i>

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,011
<i>you should use
your maiden name instead.</i>

120
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,138
Mother, I couldn't do that.
It would look bad.

121
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,142
Mmm... Well, then how about if you...

122
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,563
if you use Claire Hale-Underwood?

123
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,940
That has a nice ring to it.

124
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,567
Maybe.

125
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>- Have you seen him yet?</i>
- No, not yet.

126
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,614
<i>What are you gonna wear tonight?</i>

127
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,783
I was just deciding that now, actually.

128
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>Something dark, I hope.</i>

129
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,746
Well, it's between black and ivory,
and to tell you the truth,

130
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,165
<i>this ivory is so beautiful--</i>

131
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,959
Oh, for God's sakes,
don't wear ivory.

132
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,047
<i>Even with your figure,
it'll accentuate all the wrong places.</i>

133
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>Are you going to watch the speech?</i>

134
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,225
<i>Mother?</i>

135
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,060
Yes, I'm gonna...

136
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,063
I'm gonna have Michael
put a TV in the bedroom.

137
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,941
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is ready for you.

138
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,068
I'll be right out.

139
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,945
Mother, I have to go.

140
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,407
Yes, I-- Of course.
I'm sure you must be very busy.

141
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,783
<i>I'll see you when I get home?</i>

142
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,745
If I'm asleep...

143
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>Then I'll see you in the morning.</i>

144
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,874
<i>Goodbye, Mother.</i>

145
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,502
Bye. Wear the black!

146
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,761
I don't want even
the slightest chance this gets out.

147
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,013
We set up a perimeter.
And we'll cover the tail number.

148
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,599
Good. Set up a call with Petrov,
for after the speech.

149
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,143
It'll be 5:00 a.m. in Moscow.

150
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,769
Oh, I guarantee he'll be watching.

151
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,855
Sir?
I think you should take this.

152
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,981
Excuse me.

153
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,653
Hello, Congresswoman.

154
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,959
Sorry for the delay.
Please sit down.

155
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,921
Did you get the earrings?

156
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,173
I did.
Thank you.

157
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,840
My mother's.
Two-carat diamonds.

158
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,091
For tonight.

159
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,677
There's nothing
quite like diamond earrings.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,761
Shall we begin?

161
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,141
Uh, this year, we're handling
the arrival a bit differently.

162
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,060
You'll be escorted to the rotunda
for a photo op with the leadership

163
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,354
before going to the holding room.

164
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,649
I don't need to go to the holding room.
You can take me directly to the gallery.

165
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,277
Yes, that's fine.
Whatever the First Lady prefers.

166
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,362
And we'll need
two separate motorcades after.

167
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,573
I'll be going straight to the airport.

168
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,533
- Two motorcades, then.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,411
I'd like to brief you
on the list of special guests attending--

170
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,829
This all seems pretty straightforward.

171
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,289
I'm good if you are.

172
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,499
Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you so very much.

173
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,755
Do you have a moment?

174
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,760
How's Elizabeth?

175
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,221
She sends her regards.

176
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,972
I'll bet she does.

177
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,307
And the campaign?

178
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,268
Still exploring viability.

179
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,562
Doris isn't on board yet?

180
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,231
Uh, we'll see.

181
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,648
What have you offered her?

182
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,819
Well, I want to put together
a solid campaign strategy with LeAnn

183
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,154
before engaging her again.

184
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,992
Well, if you need my help, let me know.
She and I were very close when I was whip.

185
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,496
- You've got a lot on your plate.
- No, it's no trouble at all.

186
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,122
I'll let you know.

187
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,624
See you tonight.

188
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,432
You ready to prep, sir?

189
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,226
- I need to make some changes.
- I'll call the speech writers.

190
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,062
No, I wanna do these myself.
And track down Calista.

191
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,814
We have to make room
for one more guest.

192
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,982
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,301
Oh! Ah.

194
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,718
What's that?

195
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,346
I'm having it removed.

196
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,393
Well, that's too bad.
I liked it.

197
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,019
Hmm, time to move on.

198
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,438
From what?

199
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,982
From the me that needed a tattoo.

200
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,569
I don't have much time.

201
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,780
When do you have to be at the Capitol?

202
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
Less than an hour.

203
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,202
- Whiskey or vodka?
- Vodka.

204
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,999
How well do you know Doris Jones?

205
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,796
Oh, uh, met her a few times.
I don't know her that well, though.

206
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,590
- Why?
- Her daughter, Celia,

207
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,301
wants me to help them get appropriations
for a breast cancer clinic.

208
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,013
In return, they want to pad my campaign
with Texas money.

209
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,683
- How much?
- Three million.

210
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,142
To start.

211
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,354
Her district doesn't have
that kind of money.

212
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,189
Celia says they're courting donors
from outside the 30th.

213
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,151
But one of my aides heard
that Claire Underwood and LeAnn Harvey

214
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,821
were in Jones' office today.

215
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,657
Huh...

216
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,283
LeAnn's someone I know.

217
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,955
Glendon Hill was courting her
a few years ago.

218
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,415
Did she turn you down?

219
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,959
We couldn't afford her.

220
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,213
Look, I know you're out of the game,
but this is a lot of money.

221
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,008
If it's legit, it could really help me.
But if it's not, I--

222
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,677
I'll talk to LeAnn
and see what I can find out.

223
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,013
Here.

224
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,975
I want to taste you first.

225
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,267
Hey!

226
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,202
<i>This is a special report.</i>

227
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,663
<i>President Francis Underwood's
State of the Union address</i>

228
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,332
<i>to a joint session of Congress.</i>

229
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>Tonight the eyes of the world
are on Washington.</i>

230
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,881
<i>President Underwood will take the stage
in just a few minutes...</i>

231
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,468
Take the food away.

232
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,135
You didn't eat your lunch,
Mrs. Hale.

233
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,096
Yeah, well, I didn't feel well.

234
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,806
Then you really should eat dinner.
Your medication--

235
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,183
Please don't make me
ask you again, Michael.

236
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,769
Just take it away.
The smell of it is making me ill.

237
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,522
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,903
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the First Lady of the United States.</i>

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,298
- Celia.
- Thank you so much for arranging this.

240
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,468
It's a big honor to be sitting
next to you.

241
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,320
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

242
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,239
- Interesting place to watch the SOTU.
- Ah.

243
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,992
It's more fun this way.
You know, hanging with the hoi polloi.

244
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,746
So, what brings you to D.C.?

245
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,791
Well, all of Congress in town,
it's good for hustling work.

246
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,460
Since when do you hustle?
You turn people away.

247
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,713
How'd you know I was in town?

248
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,090
I might be retired,
but I still have my ear to the ground.

249
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,553
So that's true? The great Remy Danton
has hung up his jersey?

250
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,014
I've never felt better.

251
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,475
- Don't tell me this is a social visit.
- No.

252
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,144
- Well, if it isn't business...
- It's business.

253
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,855
- <i>Members of Congress...</i>
- Okay.

254
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,356
<i>- ...I have the high privilege...</i>
- So...

255
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,150
- Oh, hold on. The show is starting.
<i>- ...of presenting to you,</i>

256
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,986
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

257
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,957
<i>Thank you.</i>

258
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,835
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

259
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,382
<i>Thank you. Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Vice President,</i>

260
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>members of Congress,
my fellow Americans.</i>

261
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,721
<i>One year ago,</i>

262
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,849
<i>when I gave this address
for the first time,</i>

263
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,019
<i>it was during a very different period
for our country.</i>

264
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,273
Our nation was recovering
from a political scandal

265
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,234
and a trade crisis with China.

266
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,781
Before you stood a president
no one had elected.

267
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:39,661
But that same man stands before you now,
and the darkness is behind us.

268
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,039
The state of the union is bright,
and getting brighter.

269
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,840
We've had our challenges, yes.

270
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,717
Particularly with Russia.

271
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,679
There were some tense moments,
to be sure,

272
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,597
and yet we overcame those tensions.

273
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,976
President Petrov
let us continue to build trust

274
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,271
and show that we've learned
from our experiences last year.

275
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,566
And I'd personally like to acknowledge
the First Lady,

276
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,654
who led the way
in repairing those burned bridges.

277
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,914
She's getting more applause
than the president.

278
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
Good for you, isn't it?

279
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,252
Quite a high-profile client.

280
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,921
Who told you that?

281
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,216
- Just a guess.
- No, you guessed wrong.

282
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,888
So what do you know
about big Texas donors...

283
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,849
who care enough
about a poor Dallas district

284
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,852
to donate money
to a campaign in California?

285
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,186
That went right over my head.

286
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,273
First Lady was in Dallas.
You were in Dallas.

287
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,942
The First Lady is here.

288
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,777
Now you're here.

289
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,864
I think you have far too much time
on your hands, Remy.

290
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,200
Your fingerprints
are all over this money.

291
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,044
You're working for Jackie Sharp now?

292
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,338
No. Just friends.

293
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,051
- Just friends, huh?
- Yeah.

294
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,265
I think your fingerprints
are all over her.

295
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,602
How about this?

296
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,024
You don't poke around in my shit...

297
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,985
and I won't poke around in yours.

298
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,197
It was good to see you, Remy.
Don't get too soft in retirement.

299
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,494
<i>Now, it's considered uncouth</i>

300
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,663
<i>for a president
who's in the midst of a campaign,</i>

301
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,250
<i>to talk directly about
the upcoming election, but tonight,</i>

302
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,584
I feel compelled.

303
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,921
Because the votes our electorate casts

304
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:59,091
during the current primaries
and the general election in November

305
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,512
will have a profound impact
on everyone in this room.

306
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:09,185
Some of us, myself included,
may find ourselves out of a job.

307
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,480
If we want to keep our jobs,
we have to listen to the American people.

308
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,776
We have to work harder!
We have to deliver!

309
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,075
Just like Doris Jones.

310
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,954
She has kept her job in Congress
for 34 years

311
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,540
because she never relented
in the face of adversity.

312
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,253
In fact, just today, she called me
about a breast cancer clinic

313
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,673
she has been fighting for
over the past decade.

314
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,175
Now, her plan is bold.

315
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,804
<i>A VA hospital expansion
open to the general public,</i>

316
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,430
<i>financed by federal money.</i>

317
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>A bold plan that will significantly
increase successful diagnoses</i>

318
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,147
<i>and treatment through education,
screenings, and affordable care.</i>

319
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>Now, she's gotten resistance,
time and again...</i>

320
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,701
<i>from the Veterans Affairs administration,</i>

321
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,121
<i>from her colleagues in Congress...</i>

322
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,206
- Can you turn it up a bit?
<i>- ...from those who don't want to see</i>

323
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,459
<i>government funds
going to Planned Parenthood.</i>

324
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:20,672
<i>And yet, when she called me today,
she was just as passionate about</i>

325
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:25,844
this clinic as she was when she first
brought it up to me ten years ago.

326
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,437
Well, Doris, it worked.

327
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,149
I'll be working with
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,

328
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:42,028
HUD and the congressional leaders
to get you that clinic.

329
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,613
Because of you,
we'll save lives.

330
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,506
And that is exactly the sort of leadership
the American people want.

331
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,466
More leaders like Doris Jones.

332
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,553
And when she retires
at the end of this term,

333
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,139
I'm delighted to say
that her daughter, Celia,

334
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:15,519
will run for the open seat to continue
delivering just like her mother has.

335
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,771
No fucking way.

336
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,404
<i>And I, for one, will support your
candidacy with everything I've got.</i>

337
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,614
<i>And I know Claire will, as well.</i>

338
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,164
<i>Texans are tenacious.</i>

339
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,126
<i>I'm proud to be married to one,
and I'm proud to have served with one,</i>

340
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,461
like Congresswoman Jones.

341
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,089
Thank you, Doris,
for all your years of service,

342
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,217
and thank you, Celia,
for picking up the mantle.

343
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,653
Doris said
her daughter spoke out of turn,

344
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,865
that she didn't know about the deal
she was brokering with Underwood.

345
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,742
<i>Did you connect with LeAnn?</i>

346
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,372
No, I didn't.

347
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,165
She said she couldn't meet
until tomorrow.

348
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,958
<i>Well, I guess
there's no point now, anyway.</i>

349
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,960
<i>If the White House is
orchestrating the funding,</i>

350
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>Underwood's not gonna want my help.</i>

351
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,590
<i>Fuck!
I really could've used that money.</i>

352
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,260
Well, when it looks too good to be true...

353
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,719
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

354
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,430
<i>When am I gonna see you again?</i>

355
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,143
Um... I don't know.

356
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,730
I've been... feeling a bit stir-crazy.

357
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,192
If I'm retired,
I should probably travel some.

358
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,237
<i>Well, you could travel to California.</i>

359
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,823
<i>I'll be there more than here
until November.</i>

360
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,075
Yeah, maybe.

361
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,078
<i>Or don't.</i>

362
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,664
<i>You know how to reach me.</i>

363
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,644
<i>Do you think it was Remy?</i>

364
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,189
Highly doubtful.
I made it clear what we knew.

365
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,565
<i>He knows you have proof?</i>

366
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,983
He knows that I know.
Not that I have proof.

367
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,860
<i>Maybe we shouldn't have
played that card yet.</i>

368
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,280
Remy was connecting the dots.

369
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,157
<i>I needed to put the brakes on him.</i>

370
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,118
Well, if it wasn't him,
Doris must've gone to Francis himself.

371
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,369
She saw an opening and--

372
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,205
Ma'am,
there's been a change of plans.

373
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,790
Uh, hold on.
What change of plans?

374
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,834
We're taking you back to the White House.

375
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,669
No, we're going to Andrews.

376
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,754
I'm sorry,
this is direct from the president.

377
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,967
This is not gonna be
as difficult as it seems.

378
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,927
Now, Terry's gonna be in touch
with Veteran Affairs

379
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,721
first thing tomorrow
to draft an amendment.

380
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,765
And if the Republicans give us
any resistance in committee,

381
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,267
I'll start making calls.

382
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,104
No reason why this can't get to the floor
before the end of the session.

383
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,356
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,066
Thank yourself.
You played this well.

385
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,401
How did you play it?

386
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,320
Well, now, that's our little secret,
isn't it?

387
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,779
I'll walk you out.

388
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,866
Uh, Mr. President, I got this.

389
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,416
Oh, Claire.

390
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,462
Didn't the president
make the most wonderful speech?

391
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,257
Oh, he certainly did.

392
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,842
And I thank you
for convincing the president

393
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,553
to mention Celia in his remarks.

394
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,430
Well, it was my pleasure.

395
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,932
- Good night.
- Good night.

396
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,393
Good night, Claire.

397
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,838
We had a deal.

398
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:12,964
I showed up.

399
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,051
And used that opportunity
to undermine the campaign.

400
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,636
Why didn't you just ask me?

401
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,305
If you needed the clinic
to convince Doris--

402
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,597
You don't want me to run, Francis.

403
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,725
That's right, I don't.
But we'd reached an understanding.

404
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,437
I think you said
what you wanted me to hear.

405
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,938
Well, then you misread me.

406
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,610
I am looking out for myself.
Just like you are.

407
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,736
And where did that get you,

408
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,948
looking out for yourself
instead of looking out for us?

409
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,492
The 30th is dead now.
You know that.

410
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,743
You think I'm giving up?

411
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,620
What, you're gonna run
against the Joneses?

412
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,372
You'll make a fool of yourself, Claire.

413
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,123
The odds were against you
even with their blessing.

414
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,585
Now, I hoped you'd reach
that conclusion on your own.

415
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,421
But instead, you lied to me.

416
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,717
Now, I can't force you to see reason.

417
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,637
But I will not allow you
to become dangerous.

418
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,943
I'll take one.

419
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,243
Take mine.

420
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,542
Claire, look...

421
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,504
When I win the general,
then we can concentrate

422
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,340
on a Senate seat for you in Texas.

423
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,759
You don't want to be in the House, anyway.

424
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,845
And neither of us could have predicted
a Heather Dunbar,

425
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,764
or how formidable she'd be.

426
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,017
We are fighting for our lives here.

427
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,022
And when you run, you wanna do so
from a position of strength.

428
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,900
It's about timing.

429
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,616
Maybe it's too soon.
Maybe you're right.

430
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,953
But I need to think.

431
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,540
Fair enough.

432
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,624
I can't do that here.

433
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,083
Back in Texas?

434
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,753
I'm not sure how long I'll need.

435
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,087
Well, take as long as you want.

436
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,259
I should get going.

437
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,303
It's late. You sure you don't
want to spend the night?

438
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,221
- Well, Mother was expecting me.
- All right.

439
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,685
I'll walk myself out.
You enjoy your drink.

440
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,004
You know, there was a boy that lived
down the street from me in Gaffney.

441
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,507
About my age.
His name was Walter Wryson.

442
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,635
He used to run away from home all the time
and come to our house.

443
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,178
Not for any good reason.

444
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,139
His daddy didn't beat him.
He had clothes on his back.

445
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,016
The Wrysons had
way more money than we did,

446
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,562
but run away he would, at least once
a month and come straight to our place.

447
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:18,484
Now, usually, my mother would call his
mother and she'd come and fetch him.

448
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,277
But about the ninth
or tenth time this happened,

449
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:25,156
Walter ran outside,
climbed up into a tree in our backyard,

450
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,950
and wouldn't come down for nothing.

451
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,660
Now, my mama said to his mama,

452
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,203
"Why don't you let us keep him
for a while,

453
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,247
until he feels like coming home?"

454
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,127
But man, oh, man,
that boy was stubborn.

455
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,756
Night came, and he was still up there.

456
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,634
No food, no water... no toilet.

457
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:47,888
And just before I went to bed, I looked
out my window and I heard him crying.

458
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,682
And I said, "Walter,
why don't you come on down?"

459
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,059
And he just shook his head no.

460
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,855
Well, the next morning, I woke up,
I looked out the window

461
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,774
and Walter was still up in that tree.

462
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,654
So after breakfast,
I walked over with a plate of eggs...

463
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,321
and I asked him if he wanted some.

464
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,449
And again, he just shook his head.

465
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,910
And I got angry.

466
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,081
That boy had a good house, a good family,
the sort I would've killed for,

467
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,792
and he didn't even realize it.

468
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,672
So I went into the tool shed
and I took out an ax.

469
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,507
And I said to Walter...

470
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,301
"You want to know what it's really like
to live at my house?"

471
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:30,096
And I gave that tree a good whack.
And Walter cried out, but I kept on.

472
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,183
I mean, you've never heard screams
like the one coming from Walter

473
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,226
as I chopped at that tree.

474
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,895
He pissed his pants,

475
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,816
and it came raining down on the ground,
but I didn't pay it no mind.

476
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,859
I just kept whacking away.

477
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,404
Well...

478
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,740
it didn't take long before Walter was on
the ground and running back to his house.

479
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,034
You see, all he needed
was a little motivation.

480
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,621
So I'll give Claire some time.

481
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,789
But for her sake,

482
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,501
I hope she comes out of her tree
before I have to bring out my ax.

483
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,799
Hey.

484
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,766
He wants me to hold off for Senate.

485
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,267
I told him I would think about it.

486
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,855
- So it's over?
- Oh, no, it's not over.

487
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,107
He endorsed Celia on national television.

488
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,192
Forget the 30th.

489
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,987
We need to think bigger.
This cycle.

490
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,284
Then we need to talk seriously
about my compensation.

491
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,292
- He on?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,761
I'm ready.

493
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,345
<i>I'll connect you now, sir.</i>

494
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,556
<i>President Petrov,
you are now on with the president.</i>

495
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,808
<i>Good evening, Mr. President.</i>

496
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,226
Good morning, Mr. President.

497
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,186
Your speech was good.

498
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,188
Perhaps, a bit too...

499
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,482
optimistic, hmm?

500
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,484
<i>I meant what I said
about Russia.</i>

501
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,944
It's just words.
They mean very little.

502
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:11,740
<i>I'm willing to back them up with action.
First, we should talk about a bailout.</i>

503
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,535
<i>I'm willing to work with the IMF
to get you what you need.</i>

504
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:19,665
And second, as a gesture of good faith,
we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.

505
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,166
You should've done so already.

506
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,585
<i>I need your assurances he'll get a trial.</i>

507
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,087
- What do you care about Igor Milkin?
<i>- I don't.</i>

508
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,422
You can send him to Siberia

509
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,634
and let him die of black lung
in a coal mine, for all I care.

510
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,468
But I do care about your economy.

511
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,639
You keep killing high-profile businessmen
and seizing their assets.

512
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,641
- That's no--
<i>- You mean, traitors?</i>

513
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,144
Look, I am aware that they were
plotting a coup, but that still doesn't--

514
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,731
Yes, because you orchestrated it.

515
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,609
- Excuse me?
<i>- Why else would Milkin fly to America?</i>

516
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,235
We had nothing to do with this.

517
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,448
You... you lied to me
about the Jordan Valley,

518
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,116
you lied to me about Corrigan.

519
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,829
I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.

520
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,372
<i>I'm trying to help you.
But you have to help me.</i>

521
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,500
These threats of reducing
your oil production, it won't work.

522
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:08,839
You think jacking up energy prices
is gonna hurt us, but it's just extortion.

523
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,718
And I will not respond to extortion.
Now, I'll send your traitor back,

524
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,137
<i>but you've got to stop seizing companies
and making people disappear.</i>

525
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,225
Igor Milkin is worse than a traitor.
He's an American puppet.

526
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,393
<i>Regime change, that's extortion.</i>

527
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,313
Yes, but they acted on their own.
You're being paranoid.

528
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,357
Send him back. No terms.

529
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,318
<i>We're not going to get anywhere
if you're not willing to negotiate.</i>

530
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,529
Well... then I believe we're finished.

531
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,325
And I believe you're right.
Thank you, Mr. President.

532
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,206
Put Milkin in a secure location.
He's not going anywhere.

533
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,047
Mr. Milkin.

534
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,257
I need you to come with me.

535
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,217
Where are we going?

536
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,969
A detainment facility.

537
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,428
I'm not being deported, am I?

538
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,848
No, we're going to process
your asylum request.

539
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,798
Claire?

540
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,264
If you wanna smoke,
you should smoke.

541
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,516
I only wanted one drag.

542
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:32,065
He hated how you used to go down
to the stables with your cigarettes.

543
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,985
I didn't realize he knew.

544
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,780
He adored you.
You got away with murder.

545
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,868
Did you wait up for me?

546
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,495
No, it's the medication.

547
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,415
Keeps me tired all day,
and then I'm up all night.

548
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,129
I... I watched the speech.

549
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,257
What are you gonna do?

550
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,301
It's late, Mother.
Let's talk in the morning.

551
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:05,098
By the way, those earrings are beautiful.
I noticed 'em on TV.

552
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,559
They're Francis' mother's earrings.

553
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,938
- They look like they're over a carat.
- Two carats.

554
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,482
No doubt she stole them from someone.

555
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,530
The Underwoods never cease to amaze.

556
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,407
Mother...

557
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,409
I'm going to need some money.

558
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,370
For the clinic? Isn't--

559
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,665
A million five for LeAnn
and some on top of that.

560
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,002
Well, I thought your campaign was dead.

561
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,712
It is,
but I still need her to work for me.

562
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:40,050
But, what for? I mean,
I can't ask my friends for money and--

563
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,301
Our money.

564
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,849
You mean my money.

565
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,435
Don't fight me on this.

566
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,812
Daddy would've done it,
no questions asked.

567
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,398
Yes, well... I'm not as foolish as he was.

568
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,108
Well, I'll just have to sell the estate.

569
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,609
You what?

570
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,446
The money is in the trust,
but the land is in my name.

571
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,574
- You wouldn't dare.
- Well, I'm asking for your help.

572
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,742
- If you refuse to give it--
- Help?

573
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:10,205
You didn't lift a finger
to help me when I got sick.

574
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,790
You didn't tell me you were sick!

575
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,375
Because you had turned your back on me!

576
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,295
Oh, you are such a disappointment.

577
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,093
You don't want me to sell this house
out from under you, but I will.

578
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,431
I am the mother.

579
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,683
I am the mother!
