1
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,109
This is the president.

2
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,570
- <i>Put on Conway.</i>
- You will speak to me.

3
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>No, we only talk to him
or we hang up.</i>

4
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,993
Do you hear the helicopters yet?
Or the dogs?

5
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,663
We're getting closer and we will find you.

6
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,291
The only question is will you
work with us before we get there?

7
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,377
The money's not happening
and neither is the military withdrawal.

8
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,213
But you're smart enough to know that.

9
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,175
The objective here is Ahmadi,
and that's what I'd like to discuss.

10
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,220
<i>Well, the choice is yours.
You either meet our demands or you don't.</i>

11
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,268
I spoke at length last night
with Governor Conway.

12
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,021
I was of a mind
to ignore your call this morning,

13
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,648
but he convinced me
that we should keep talking.

14
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,650
Isn't that right, Governor?

15
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,739
- I just want a peaceful resolution.
- As do I.

16
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,158
You wanted to include the Governor,
I want to include Ahmadi.

17
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,370
<i>- You're trying to stall.</i>
- You refusing to speak to your leader?

18
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
<i>Is he on now?</i>

19
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,332
You release the Millers,
then we put him on.

20
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,793
<i>No, you don't get to dictate terms.</i>

21
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,587
We show good will
when you show good will.

22
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,549
I'm giving you ten seconds
to reconsider your position.

23
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,719
After that, we disconnect the call.

24
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,846
Insha'Allah.
<i>We'll kill them.</i>

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,974
Ten seconds, starting now.

26
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,230
Five seconds.

27
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,612
- End the call.
<i>- One hostage.</i>

28
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,572
- All three.
<i>- One.</i>

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,742
Give us the daughter
and the mother.

30
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,786
<i>No, we keep the girl.</i>

31
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,579
You managed to get the President
of the United States on the phone

32
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,290
not once, but twice.

33
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,500
You will release
the daughter and the mother

34
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,210
or you will never hear from me again,

35
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,838
and you will lose your chance
to speak to your leader.

36
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,339
Tell me now.

37
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,220
They've disconnected, sir.

38
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,444
Stop.

39
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,244
Mr. Ahmadi.

40
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,042
You can shower upstairs.
There's fresh clothes in the closet.

41
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,626
The only people who know
are the Chairman

42
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,752
and the SEALs who escorted him.

43
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,505
- Do we have a secure line?
- Direct to the Oval.

44
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,049
Mr. President...

45
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,138
I would have never condoned
bringing Ahmadi into this.

46
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,140
Well, lucky for me,
I'm not making decisions

47
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,225
based on what you would
or would not condone.

48
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,187
Watch me tell the press
you put words in my mouth.

49
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,647
Feel free.

50
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,233
I think they'll have a hard time
believing you, though.

51
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,779
Check your messages.
I'm sure your staff's been emailing you.

52
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,824
Arrange for a car to get the governor
and his family to the airport.

53
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,368
Have a safe trip back to New York.

54
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,151
I've had lunch brought in.

55
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,404
I'm sure it's been quite a while
since you've had a hot meal.

56
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,741
- I won't be eating it.
- Aren't you hungry?

57
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,453
I don't wanna get sick
while I'm being tortured.

58
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,498
No one's getting tortured.
Please, have a seat.

59
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,598
You want me to tell these men
to release the family, right?

60
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,725
If I don't, you'll do what you have to do.

61
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,938
Oh, if we had any intention of that,
you never would have left Guantanamo.

62
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,689
Nor would I be here.

63
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,566
Where is here?

64
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,195
Virginia, in a government safe house.

65
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
And why you?

66
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,619
Out of respect...
for the gravity of this situation.

67
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,331
I think your intention
is to humiliate me.

68
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,959
You've been properly clothed,
offered food.

69
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,128
How are we humiliating you?

70
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm sitting across from a woman.

71
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,678
There's no reason
to keep up the facade.

72
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,057
You and your brother
are not fundamentalists,

73
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,517
nor are you Syrian.

74
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,478
This what the CIA's feeding you?

75
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,357
You're Iraqi.
Your real name is Al Awad.

76
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,366
Actually, it says that you joined
the Baath Party in 2000.

77
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,743
You were the assistant
to the undersecretary of infrastructure,

78
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
2001, 2002.

79
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,580
Say whatever you want.

80
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,585
My brother will deny.
You won't convince anyone but yourselves.

81
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,091
We expel the Baathists

82
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,553
and you go from a bureaucrat
to an extremist.

83
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,681
But you're a well-educated man, Yusuf...

84
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,143
and you don't care about Islam
or the caliphate.

85
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,645
You're just using that
to radicalize soldiers.

86
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,024
Just as you use democracy and freedom.

87
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,944
So now we understand each other.

88
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,743
Yusuf Al Ahmadi remains
in solitary confinement in Guantanamo.

89
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,870
If Caroline and Melissa Miller
are released,

90
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,041
we will allow supervised contact
with the kidnappers.

91
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,417
Mark.

92
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,628
Ahmadi has consistently encouraged
acts of terror like this one.

93
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,964
What makes you think
that any sort of dialogue

94
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,591
will lead to a peaceful resolution?

95
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,843
Well, the alternative
is no dialogue at all.

96
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,386
We don't wanna leave
any stone unturned.

97
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,222
Sara.

98
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,432
Will you comment on
the <i>Wall Street Telegraph</i> article

99
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,235
about Governor Conway's
alleged interference

100
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,727
with the House Intelligence Committee?

101
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,189
Well, it confirms
what we suspected to be true,

102
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,983
but I think you want
the governor's comment, not ours.

103
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,402
Congressman Walleck
is misrepresenting events.

104
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,946
- You're saying he lied?
- I'm saying he misrepresented.

105
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,407
I have a number of friends
on the Intelligence Committee,

106
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,077
and do I speak with them sometimes?
Of course.

107
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,786
But that's not the same as interfering.

108
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,081
So you never discussed the Russia plan
with anyone on the committee?

109
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,207
We may have discussed it,

110
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,542
but it's not as though
I was issuing orders.

111
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,379
And I have to say,
everyone's primary focus right now

112
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,339
needs to be on the Miller family,
not this.

113
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,091
Did the president ask you
to leave the White House?

114
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,677
Uh, we agreed that I'd done my part,
and that the rest is up to him.

115
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,053
Can you tell us about
your conversation last night

116
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,597
with the president,
regarding Ahmadi?

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,015
That'll be all for now.
Thank you so much.

118
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,017
Question, sir.

119
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,188
Let's go.

120
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,732
Uh, hold on,
I'm still fastening Lily's car seat.

121
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,653
- Will...
- Not a word.

122
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,531
Well, I have to tell you,
the general's apeshit

123
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,867
over what you said about
being ashamed of your service.

124
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,327
He may talk to the press.

125
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,789
Nobody does any press until we have
a proper response to all this shit.

126
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,582
Daddy said "shit."
Shit, shit, shit!

127
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,876
Stop it!

128
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,796
You need to bring me something on Walleck.
We need to discredit him.

129
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,799
- Are you done yet?
- You don't need to snap at us.

130
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,508
- Are you done yet?
- Yes.

131
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,009
Let's go. Now.

132
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,138
That's if they're released.

133
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,223
We'll fill in the blanks
once we have details.

134
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,810
This is if the worst happens.

135
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
Yates wrote these?

136
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,362
No, I... I took a stab at it first.

137
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,243
Also, Tom Hammerschmidt called.

138
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,455
He wants an interview with the president.
He wouldn't say what for.

139
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,833
What outlet is he with now?

140
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,337
He's back at the <i>Herald.</i>
Said he emailed you directly.

141
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,105
I need the room.

142
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,275
Everyone out.

143
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,532
Get me the <i>Herald.</i>

144
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,285
Tom Hammerschmidt.

145
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,413
Well, there's a cell tower here.

146
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,915
Uh, typically very low traffic,

147
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,877
but it showed higher usage
during the time of the call,

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,712
especially the southeastern antenna.

149
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,298
So we should be able to ping the hotspot,
zero in?

150
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,799
Eh, it's hundreds of tower faces.

151
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,302
I can give you the general area,
but pinpointing will take longer.

152
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,845
I can't even guarantee it's gonna be them.

153
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,722
I want every one of those towers analyzed.

154
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,683
Well, we're better off concentrating
on ambient background sound.

155
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:10,229
If I can match that to other calls made
in this area around the same time as...

156
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,691
I'm not asking your advice.
I'm telling you what I want you to do.

157
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,527
Focus on the tower data.

158
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,240
We were concentrating on this area,
but it looks like they're closer to here.

159
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,285
We've got ground teams
setting up a search grid.

160
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,494
Can we use satellites?

161
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,997
We are, but there are over 100
possible structures within the zone.

162
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,000
- Each one of them needs to be checked.
- How long?

163
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,753
If we get lucky, within hours.
If not, could be tomorrow.

164
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,004
Sir, Mr. Stamper's here.

165
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,506
- He says it's urgent.
- Thank you.

166
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,216
Hammerschmidt says
they go online today,

167
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,010
whether you comment or not.

168
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:51,062
Travel logs are not hard evidence.
These quotes are circumstantial.

169
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,815
But all of it combined...
I don't know how we spin this.

170
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,401
He's got heavy hitters on the record.

171
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,195
Should I release the photos
of Jackie and Remy?

172
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
They told him about the affair.

173
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,950
He's putting in the article
that we threatened to expose them.

174
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,702
How did this happen?

175
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,623
This is as much on you.

176
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,673
I can put together a list
of the people he hasn't gotten to yet.

177
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,592
And give him proof of a cover-up?

178
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,177
He's right.
If we reach out to Tusk or Lanagin...

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,637
I want Hammerschmidt here.

180
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,892
- Sir, I wasn't suggesting...
- Set it up as soon as possible.

181
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,689
The U.S. government
will never recognize the caliphate.

182
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,859
No, of course not.

183
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,904
But we can reintegrate the Baathists
into the government.

184
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,157
What government?
There's no government in Iraq.

185
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,827
There is no Iraq.
There's Baghdad.

186
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,830
Shia, Sunni, Kurd...

187
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,374
Syria is the same.

188
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,836
You maintained order
before we shut you out.

189
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,965
Now, we can't support a theocracy,

190
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,718
but we can put the military
back in control.

191
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,222
What do we do
with all the soldiers we've recruited?

192
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,933
They won't accept a secular government.

193
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,185
You'll keep them in check.

194
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,605
With force, if necessary.

195
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,107
Use our guns on the men
who carried it for us.

196
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,779
What does it matter...
if you have back your power?

197
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,783
If this is your intention,
why have you said nothing publicly?

198
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:32,246
Because you know that all of this
has to be done behind closed doors.

199
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,125
We need to give the appearance
that we neutralized ICO.

200
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,424
What happens
if they don't release the hostages?

201
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,676
Well, then you go back to Cuba.

202
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,345
If they do,
then we put you on the phone with them...

203
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,640
and you tell them to release the third.

204
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,935
And then you send me back to Cuba anyway.

205
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,897
I do understand why you don't trust us,
but what is the alternative?

206
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,857
These people die,
and then it gives us

207
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,445
all the justification we need
for a full offensive.

208
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,071
That's years...

209
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,408
and you won't completely destroy us.

210
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,703
Not completely,
but enough to make you irrelevant.

211
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,873
Or we can quietly work together.

212
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,794
ICO fades,
and you and your generals get control.

213
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,811
Hey. Uh...

214
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,242
- Do you know where Claire is?
- No, we're trying to find her.

215
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,495
She usually keeps me informed
if she's going somewhere.

216
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,787
Have you asked Secret Service?

217
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,664
- They didn't know.
- They have to know.

218
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,207
I'll go ask again.

219
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,543
Thanks.

220
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,921
She wasn't at the residence.

221
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,923
- You went up there?
- Ten minutes ago.

222
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,593
What's going on between you two?

223
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,516
You think I haven't noticed?

224
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,184
How you two talk?
How often you're here?

225
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,605
I don't even have unrestricted
access to the residence.

226
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,608
I was with her when her mother died.

227
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,569
It made us close.

228
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,863
Don't read too much into it.

229
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,447
Well, however close you are,

230
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,325
just make sure that nobody else
can read too much into it.

231
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,790
Well, if you see Claire,
tell her I went home.

232
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,249
If she needs me.

233
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,048
Don't meet face-to-face.
Have him submit the questions in writing.

234
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,676
Yeah, but if I meet with him,
maybe I can give him pause.

235
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,279
<i>No, he's trying to trap you
into giving something away.</i>

236
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,221
That's not going to happen.

237
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,892
- <i>The timing on this...</i>
- How's your end?

238
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,603
<i>He's getting there.</i>

239
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,231
Well, you focus on him.
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

240
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,945
<i>Are you smoking?</i>

241
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,864
- How did you know?
<i>- I can hear it.</i>

242
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,828
If this story comes out,
it won't be the smoking that does us in.

243
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,461
Have they been killed?

244
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,756
You look upset.

245
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,051
Do you miss your wife?

246
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,804
You don't care about my wife.

247
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,724
Ah, I don't care
about either of you...

248
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,436
whether you live or die...
or your children do.

249
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,815
But if speaking to your family
once a month will get us there,

250
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,149
I'll put that on the table.

251
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,196
I haven't seen my wife in three years.

252
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,200
I have a son I've never met,
a daughter that doesn't remember me.

253
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,910
This is our path.

254
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,122
Even if they're killed?

255
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,666
Yes.

256
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,210
Because they will be.

257
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,381
I'm willing to die, and so are they.

258
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,467
- Would they have made that choice?
- What choice?

259
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,263
All they've known are your bombs.
Poof, gone.

260
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,350
We're effective
because we make you feel the pain.

261
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,982
We've felt it all our lives.

262
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,653
Yes?

263
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,867
- Tom.
- Mr. President.

264
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,412
I'm gonna ask that everything
we discuss today is off the record.

265
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,289
- Understood.
- Now, the last time we met,

266
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,916
it was in the vice president's office,

267
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,461
and you claim that I acquired
that office by manipulating Matthews.

268
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,380
I don't claim that.
President Walker does.

269
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,676
Oh, yes. A man made bitter
by his own mistakes.

270
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,512
And you also claim
that I then acquired this office

271
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,182
by pushing out that very same man.

272
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,601
- Danton and Sharp corroborated.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,021
Two people with very big chips
on their shoulders,

274
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,651
fabricating all this nonsense
to justify their infidelity.

275
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,111
You're saying you didn't blackmail them?

276
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,488
I pressure a lot of people, Tom.
That's part of politics.

277
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,365
But never those two.

278
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,869
Danton's parents say LeAnn Harvey
came to their house in Miami.

279
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,122
Well, I imagine that's because
he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.

280
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,958
Then why did she come to him
instead of him coming to her?

281
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,625
Look, I'm not gonna get
into the weeds on this,

282
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,169
but let's just cut to the chase.

283
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,879
The allegations that you're making

284
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,716
are just as ludicrous as they were
the first time we met.

285
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,843
I had nothing concrete then.
This time I do.

286
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,262
Three people with an ax to grind,
no hard evidence and some travel logs?

287
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,889
I'd hardly call that concrete.

288
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,685
- It's enough for a story.
- You're floating an idea out of thin air.

289
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,938
Let's just call this what it is:
blatant sensationalism

290
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,690
- tied to the election...
- I don't float.

291
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,776
Tied to an election
to boost your circulation

292
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,486
because the <i>Herald</i> is losing readership.

293
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,907
Sir, I don't float stories
to see if they're seaworthy,

294
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,910
and I don't give a shit about circulation.

295
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,872
The only thing I care about
is the truth.

296
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,206
The truth?

297
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,293
So have you reached out to Raymond Tusk
for a comment? Or Daniel Lanagin?

298
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,545
I don't see their quotes in here.

299
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,797
I mean, if you're going for the truth,

300
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,258
doesn't that include being thorough?
Being balanced?

301
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,218
Which is why I'm giving you
an opportunity to comment.

302
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,346
And what about any members of Congress?
I don't see their quotes in here.

303
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm sure they'll answer my calls
once this article comes out.

304
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,100
Oh, I think you're afraid
to make those calls,

305
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,728
'cause you know
they'll see this for what it is...

306
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,981
unsupported tabloid gossip.

307
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,401
The assistant whip,
your former Chief of Staff,

308
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,986
an ex-president of the United States.

309
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,238
That's not gossip.
It's news.

310
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,881
There's no way the Justice Department
doesn't open up an inquiry.

311
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,619
And if they don't,
the Republicans in Congress will.

312
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,206
Downplay this all you want,
but you know where this story leads.

313
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,708
I know what this story is.

314
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:55,046
Political sabotage, plain and simple.

315
00:20:55,129 --> 00:21:00,259
Margaret Tilden used to have
some integrity, Tom.

316
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,136
And so did you.

317
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,389
Why are you wasting
America's time with this,

318
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,808
in the middle of this crisis?

319
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,393
Where is your conscience?

320
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,439
That's the question
I want you to answer.

321
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,528
Yes?

322
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,991
Sir, they emailed a location
of the mother and daughter.

323
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,577
Will you please show Mr. Hammerschmidt
into the Roosevelt Room?

324
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,787
There's no need.
I'll be going.

325
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,790
Oh, no, no, no.
You and I are not done, Tom.

326
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,735
Caroline and Melissa Miller were rescued

327
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,365
at approximately 12:30
Eastern Standard Time by FBI field agents.

328
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,827
Aside from the psychological trauma
of their ordeal,

329
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,913
both are unharmed and healthy.

330
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,332
I'll be calling them soon,
and I hope to meet them soon,

331
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,960
once they have had
their full medical examinations.

332
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,964
<i>And while I am greatly relieved
to have them both safe,</i>

333
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,841
<i>James Miller remains in danger.</i>

334
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,427
<i>And we will not rest
until I can come to this podium</i>

335
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,097
<i>and make another
announcement like this one,</i>

336
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,557
<i>informing you of his safe return.</i>

337
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,269
Mr. Grayson will answer
any questions you may have.

338
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,730
I must get back to work.
Thank you all very much.

339
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,776
They're alive.
You can take some credit for that.

340
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,779
I'm sure Underwood's flying them
to the White House right now.

341
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>Caroline and Melissa
will remain under...</i>

342
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,866
That's the image everyone will remember.

343
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,995
The warm embrace, the reassuring words.

344
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,247
I mean, he's not gonna let me take
one ounce of credit for this.

345
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,041
<i>If they choose to talk
with the media, however,</i>

346
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,625
<i>we will certainly facilitate that.</i>

347
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,255
<i>- I will now take some of your questions.</i>
- What if it were Lily and me?

348
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,050
Will, what if it were me and Lily?

349
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,968
Would this be your thinking?

350
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,595
- "The political fallout"?
- Don't, Hannah.

351
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,765
Don't get weak on me.

352
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,144
<i>I can confirm that that is an area
where our focus is,</i>

353
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,396
<i>but that's about as much
detail as I can go into.</i>

354
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,274
<i>Have the kidnappers made contact?</i>

355
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>And if so, did you put them
in touch with Ahmadi?</i>

356
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,321
They have not made contact.
We encourage them to do so.

357
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,948
And, yes, the offer still stands.

358
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,115
Mary.

359
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,285
Uh, what assurances do you have
that Ahmadi will say what you want him to?

360
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,120
We don't,
and we can't force him to.

361
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,914
But we're hoping
that he will work with us on this.

362
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,375
Who's managing the call
from his side in Cuba?

363
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm sorry,
I can't go into details on that.

364
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,795
Both were blindfolded in the car,

365
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,298
but the mother estimates
a drive time of 45 minutes.

366
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,021
That narrows the search
to six structures.

367
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,172
Unless they're on the move.

368
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,552
If they're past the roadblocks already,

369
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,886
they've gotta stop somewhere
to make the call.

370
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,451
And we've had some progress
on tracing the call.

371
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,895
Hey, hey.

372
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,481
You're taking my algorithms.

373
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,109
We need more teams on this.
There is not enough room here.

374
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,694
You know my instructions were
never to let anything leave this building.

375
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,071
We have an order from the director.

376
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,156
Well, if you put more teams on this,
it'll cause confusion.

377
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,784
Go home, Mr. Macallan.
You've been here for two days straight.

378
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,286
I am not leaving this

379
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,872
in the hands of people
who do not know what they're doing.

380
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,165
We've got it covered.

381
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,253
Go home. Get some rest.
We'll let you know if we need you.

382
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,425
These boys don't wanna kill anyone.

383
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,762
If they did, they wouldn't have
released two hostages.

384
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,181
They're actually looking
for an excuse to back out.

385
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:37,518
If the media plays that video,
I look like a traitor.

386
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,272
We tell them it's a precondition.
If they share it, the deal is off.

387
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,774
How do I know you won't?

388
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,111
I can't force you to believe me...

389
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,988
but we are hours from finding them.

390
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,490
And you know how this goes.

391
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,286
Jim Miller dies.
They die.

392
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,205
You go back to Cuba.
We go to war.

393
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,457
We're already at war.

394
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:06,338
Yusuf, you have one chance
to change the conditions at home.

395
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:11,093
You squander it, you destroy everything
you have ever fought for.

396
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,182
What do you know about
fighting for anything?

397
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,601
We're done here.
Send him back.

398
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,440
All right.

399
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,444
I'll do what you ask.

400
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,780
Put him back in his jumpsuit.
We'll film in the basement.

401
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,240
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,078
Tell the senator
I'll call him when I get back.

403
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,788
- Mr. President.
- Oh, Cathy.

404
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,665
I realize we haven't had a chance
to discuss everything.

405
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,999
We'll talk foreign policy consequences

406
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,293
once we've resolved
this hostage situation.

407
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,795
It's not that.
The <i>Herald</i> contacted me.

408
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,716
A reporter called my office.
I've read the email.

409
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,399
- You didn't call them back?
- 'Course not.

410
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,386
All right. Don't do or say anything.
I'll handle it.

411
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,180
- How?
- I don't know yet.

412
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,724
Walker says we conspired
for Secretary of State,

413
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,768
and saying I gave him asylum
during the investigation.

414
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,854
If they publish this,
I get skinned alive, too.

415
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,941
We're going to be all right, Cathy.
Trust me on this.

416
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,791
I just spoke with Secretary Durant.

417
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,461
We have a timeline.

418
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,798
My folks don't hear from me,
they start making calls on the hour.

419
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,842
Durant was first.

420
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,802
Birch is next.

421
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,721
Then Womack.

422
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,223
Michael Kern.

423
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,726
It was Zoe's article
that ruined his chances.

424
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,686
You knew her.
You were in her neighborhood.

425
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,480
This is irresponsible, Tom.

426
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,608
When the whole nation is in the middle
of this major terror threat.

427
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,318
That's the same reasoning dictators use.

428
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,697
You remind me
a little bit of Kate Baldwin.

429
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,283
You've lost your objectivity.

430
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,701
Uh, it's funny you mention her.

431
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,121
Kate thought Lucas was onto something.
I told her to let it go,

432
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,541
that there wasn't anything there,
but there was.

433
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:10,045
Well, where are the facts?
Facts, not quotes. Facts.

434
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,713
You wanna see a fact?

435
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,508
This is a fact.

436
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:20,138
I told you he was crazy,
and there's the proof.

437
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,309
He had the facts wrong,
but he had the story right.

438
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,479
He saw through you.

439
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,399
So what is the story? That I'm some sort
of psychopath? That I'm a killer?

440
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,401
Oh, I never believed you were a murderer,
and I still don't.

441
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,237
But it's becoming harder
not to entertain the thought.

442
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,948
Well, should I get you a gun,
so you can shoot me, too?

443
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,911
He was right about your soul.

444
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,706
What's in your bones.

445
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,335
That you're ruthless.
You're corrupt.

446
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,254
You destroy whatever's in your path.

447
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,881
Hmm.

448
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,594
Name me a president you wouldn't
describe in exactly the same way.

449
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,180
We're all ruthless.
We all destroy.

450
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,808
But corruption?
That's a matter of perspective.

451
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,018
No.

452
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,604
It's a matter of law.

453
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,606
All right, you seem
a little confused here, Tom.

454
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,985
One moment you're talking about my soul,
and the next moment you want to get legal.

455
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,240
Let's at least achieve
some clarity here today, shall we?

456
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,784
You want the real story?

457
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,622
Zoe Barnes?

458
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,708
Yes, we knew each other.
Professionally.

459
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,378
I scratched her back
and she scratched mine.

460
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,506
And you printed all of it.

461
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,677
You were her source
for the education bill.

462
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,805
- And Michael Kern.
- You sabotaged him.

463
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,726
Okay, ask yourself
why I would have done all those things.

464
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:54,691
Because the education bill was a disaster,
and I had to move the president off of it.

465
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:58,069
Because Michael Kern was
a terrible choice for Secretary of State.

466
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,531
We could do better,
and we did, with Cathy.

467
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,283
I was trying to help Walker.

468
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:06,578
I was trying to steer a weak president
in the right direction.

469
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,622
Now, you want to print that story,
you go right ahead.

470
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,206
But the rest of it is just nonsense.

471
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,875
You didn't make any deals
with Raymond Tusk?

472
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,461
- Absolutely not.
- Then why did you pardon him?

473
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,145
Same reason I pardoned Walker.
Because the country had to move on.

474
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,800
You didn't orchestrate his impeachment?

475
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,511
Why would I want to impeach a president
I was working so hard to help?

476
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,721
You're still here.
He's not.

477
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,766
I was trying to save him
from himself.

478
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,937
Unfortunately, I failed.

479
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,694
- Do you trust your instincts, Tom?
- I always have.

480
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,737
Then look me in the eye.

481
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,953
I've told you the truth.

482
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,124
What you said...

483
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,794
is it on the record now?

484
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,797
Do you believe me?

485
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,425
Not for a second.

486
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,472
Then, no.
Not a word.

487
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,275
We'll give you a few hours
if you want to make an official comment.

488
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,499
I'm ready to go now.

489
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,045
If they release the father, you're a hero.

490
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,341
<i>It's not enough.
I don't know how we survive this story.</i>

491
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:50,391
My mind keeps racing,
over and over and over again.

492
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,560
<i>What we could've done differently.
How we could've covered our tracks.</i>

493
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,896
<i>The people we should've kept closer...</i>

494
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,149
I'm frightened, Claire.

495
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,444
<i>If we can't stop the damage,
we have to control it, Francis.</i>

496
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,572
There is a solution.
There always is.

497
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,908
Hold on.

498
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,451
They're on, sir.

499
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,161
We just got word.

500
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,163
- They've called in.
<i>- Yes, I was just told.</i>

501
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,457
<i>All right, this first.
One thing at a time.</i>

502
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,181
- The link is up?
- Yes, ma'am.

503
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,641
We've located the building.

504
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,444
Matches the description
from Caroline Miller

505
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,977
and the drive time
from where they were found.

506
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,729
Are we certain that they're there?

507
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,816
No, sir, but we have a team en route.

508
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,945
Let's see how the phone call goes,
and then we'll decide if we're gonna move.

509
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,280
The line is open.

510
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,615
Go ahead.

511
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,453
- This is the president.
<i>- Where's Ahmadi?</i>

512
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,081
We're about to connect him via video,
so you know that he's speaking freely.

513
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,877
But before we do, be aware that if
you release any of this call to the media,

514
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,130
anything we discuss will be off the table.

515
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,799
<i>Put him on.</i>

516
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,683
Assalam-alaikum.

517
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,351
Walaikum-assalam.

518
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,853
<i>I know you are trying to free me.</i>

519
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,486
English.

520
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,365
Listen to me.

521
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,118
You've already done your duty.

522
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,203
You have made the world pay attention.

523
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,540
But the U.S. government,
they will not free me.

524
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:43,044
And if you harm this man,
they'll bring more bloodshed on Muslims.

525
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,838
Let him go.

526
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,759
They have promised me they will
only charge you for kidnapping...

527
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,301
not as terrorists.

528
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,432
<i>Are they forcing you to say this?</i>

529
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,934
No.

530
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,816
<i>Who are you looking to?</i>

531
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,620
Off.

532
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,755
They've hung up.

533
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,010
What did he just say?

534
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,261
What did you say?

535
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,598
Tell me what you said.

536
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,852
I'm not a traitor.

537
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,273
Keep him down here.

538
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,654
<i>"Release the video.</i>

539
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,948
<i>If they don't send me home, kill them.</i>

540
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,325
<i>If they find you, kill him.</i>

541
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,370
<i>Make sure you have proof that I..."
And then it goes black.</i>

542
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,540
<i>Where that leaves us,
we don't know right now.</i>

543
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,793
<i>The White House has not briefed the press
or issued any statement...</i>

544
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,092
What do I say to this?

545
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,895
- We say nothing.
- No, I can't say nothing,

546
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,262
'cause I got 100 reporters
that are about to break down that door.

547
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,725
We are not going to expose ourselves
until we have something concrete to go on.

548
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,268
Like the guy's head rolling?
Or are you saying nothing then, too?

549
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,436
Or how about the <i>Herald</i> article?

550
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,021
When that comes out,
are you gonna say nothing?

551
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,106
Seth...

552
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,442
Look, I will lock myself up in here.
I'll bury my head in the sand.

553
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,071
But eventually,
it's me that has to face these people.

554
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,698
All right, I can't hide the way that you...

555
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,157
Stop. Stop!

556
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,078
Keep your shit together.

557
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,247
Okay?

558
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,002
Eat some food.
Rest your eyes for a little bit.

559
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,380
I'll let you know when I know more.

560
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,316
- Oh, sir, a...
- Not now.

561
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,663
- You brought him here?
- I brought myself.

562
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,831
It's serious, Doug.

563
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,595
Ready.

564
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,636
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

565
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,263
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

566
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,601
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

567
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,476
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

568
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,109
<i>Clear.</i>

569
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
<i>- It's empty.
- All clear.</i>

570
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,158
- It's empty, sir.
<i>- Confirmed. All clear.</i>

571
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,545
Francis, did they find...

572
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,465
No.

573
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,468
- I thought Ahmadi was going to...
- No, we are where we are.

574
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,179
We knew it was a risk.

575
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,182
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

576
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,228
Let's get you upstairs.

577
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,017
<i>...by Tom Hammerschmidt, 15 minutes ago.</i>

578
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,728
<i>In the article, it says the president
was asked to comment, but declined.</i>

579
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,523
<i>Among those quoted
are ex-president Garrett Walker,</i>

580
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,942
<i>Congresswoman Jackie...</i>

581
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,362
How many phone calls
have you got so far?

582
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,992
Uh, at least 30.

583
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,996
- You?
- Ah, I stopped counting.

584
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,918
Where should we go?

585
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,091
Surprise me.

586
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,183
No, we don't say anything.

587
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,061
We'll let him burn in the lights
for a few days and see how this plays out.

588
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,396
And then we blanket
every swing state with ads.

589
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,649
Thirty seconds, in silence.
Just the headline.

590
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,776
Let that sink into people's gray matter.

591
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:42,904
Yeah.

592
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,448
Okay.
We'll talk soon.

593
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,159
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

594
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,536
I'm still upset.

595
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,082
You can't pretend that nothing's happened.

596
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,253
I am not weak.

597
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,214
I shouldn't have said that.
I know you're not.

598
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,050
And here's something else I know.

599
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,803
You're gonna be the next
First Lady of the United States.

600
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,572
All right, stay in your office.

601
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,242
I'll call you back in a bit.

602
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,457
Some Prinivil and aspirin, please.

603
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,014
It's out?

604
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,560
Yes.

605
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,691
Doug's got Macallan with him, too.

606
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,610
They're expanding his program,
but without him in charge.

607
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,363
So we're not safe there, either.

608
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,907
Well, if he was...

609
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,868
if he was there to manage it,
but he's not, so...

610
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,706
No, we're not safe.

611
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,508
- Should I call Dr. Saxon?
- No, it's not necessary.

612
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,802
- Thank you very much. That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,441
Three weeks...

614
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,445
then the election.

615
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,781
It's nothing.

616
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,245
And then we lose.

617
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,791
And they investigate.

618
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,214
And everything we...

619
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,803
Gone.

620
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,477
I feel...

621
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,480
numb.

622
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,400
I do, too.

623
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,831
We make time.

624
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:49,049
We can't fight everything off
one by one, Francis.

625
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,594
But if we make this...

626
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,974
we make it work for us.

627
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,396
Create chaos.

628
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,274
More than chaos.

629
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,621
War.

630
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,624
Fear.

631
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,835
Fear.

632
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,255
Brutal.

633
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,468
Total.

634
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,181
I'm done trying
to win over people's hearts.

635
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,143
Let's attack their hearts.

636
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,188
We can work with fear.

637
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,817
Yes, we can.

638
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,498
You should put on a fresh suit.

639
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,961
The navy blue.

640
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,590
Yes, the navy blue.

641
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,515
- Where's Macallan?
- We sent him home.

642
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,933
All right, tell him to stay put.
We'll tackle that later.

643
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,187
Have Seth inform the networks.
The Oval, one hour.

644
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,314
- Do you need him to draft something?
- Tom will write it.

645
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,192
- He's not here.
- Then get him here.

646
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,614
What about the last part
that you crossed out?

647
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,660
Uh, "To mourn is not to fear.
To grieve is not to admit defeat."

648
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,328
You should keep that in.

649
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,039
But it presumes he's going to die.

650
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,459
He is going to die.

651
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,256
We talk to the lawyers first,
then you can talk to the press.

652
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,049
I've got major funders
pulling out already.

653
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,884
The president should put in calls
to set them at ease.

654
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,053
No. No calls.
The campaign's on hold.

655
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,515
We lose that money, so be it.
We need to stabilize.

656
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,310
I don't think he should say
the part about mourning and grief.

657
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,020
I agree, but Yates said
they wanted it back in.

658
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,189
Is it true?

659
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,276
What Hammerschmidt wrote?
Is it?

660
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,402
No.

661
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:19,240
That's the first time you've lied to me...
since you stopped lying to me.

662
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:37,342
My fellow Americans,
over the past two years,

663
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,802
certainly within
the last several days and hours,

664
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,639
I have asked myself,
"What does it mean to be president?

665
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,434
What does true leadership look like?"

666
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,604
It's a question many of you
have asked yourselves

667
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,231
as November approaches.

668
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:55,526
Right now, as I sit in this chair,
in this office,

669
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,445
where so many of my predecessors

670
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,906
have steered our nation
through turbulent times...

671
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,870
I realize that this job is one
that transcends politics and rhetoric.

672
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,374
<i>Entrusted to anyone
who sits behind this desk</i>

673
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:14,337
<i>is something far more elemental,
the very survival of our nation.</i>

674
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,468
<i>And I, as your president,
must confront the storm before us.</i>

675
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,970
<i>That storm is terror.</i>

676
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,516
More dangerous and unpredictable
than any hurricane.

677
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,186
It has endangered us abroad.
It has endangered us at home.

678
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:36,066
And right now, it has placed James Miller
in the gravest of dangers.

679
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,612
<i>We attempted to communicate
with his captors.</i>

680
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,698
<i>We hoped for a peaceful solution.</i>

681
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:48,162
<i>We're relieved that Caroline
and Melissa Miller are safe and sound.</i>

682
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,542
<i>But terror is blind to reason.</i>

683
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:57,755
<i>Given the opportunity to renounce terror,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi chose to encourage it.</i>

684
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,675
<i>So, unfortunately,</i>

685
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,554
<i>we must now move beyond reason.</i>

686
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,806
<i>We must respond with force.</i>

687
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:11,143
Because there is no scenario
in which we will release him.

688
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:15,147
He will remain in United States custody
until his dying breath.

689
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,902
If the captors call again,
we will not answer.

690
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:25,157
The time for conversation is over,
no matter the consequences.

691
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,119
Regardless of whether James Miller
is released or not,

692
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,246
rescued or not,

693
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,873
killed or not...

694
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,377
ICO will be destroyed.

695
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,798
We are at war.

696
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,133
It will be a war more total

697
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:48,305
than anything we have waged thus far
in the fight against extremism.

698
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,433
Soldiers will die.

699
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,852
Civilians may die.

700
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:57,147
There will be pain.
There will be suffering.

701
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:02,236
We will be confronted with
the most horrific aspects of humanity.

702
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,698
We will confront the inhuman.

703
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,033
Evil itself.

704
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,703
But we will triumph.

705
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,831
It is not a war we will lose.

706
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,503
And if the worst happens
to James Miller...

707
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,505
we must remember,

708
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:26,552
To mourn is not to fear.
To grieve is not to admit defeat.

709
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,679
God bless America,

710
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,058
and all of those
who believe in freedom and democracy.

711
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,108
- Any news?
- They just posted on Twitter.

712
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,233
9:00 sharp, live on the Internet.
We won't find them before that.

713
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,528
Do we have the capability
to block the video?

714
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,154
Well, we might be able
to block some sites,

715
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,115
- but if they have enough mirrors...
- Don't block anything.

716
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,492
Yes, sir.

717
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,038
The whole world should watch this.

718
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,457
And we should, too.

719
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,802
- What you said, "We're at war..."
- I want to build a coalition.

720
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,554
- More air strikes?
- Ground, air...

721
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,263
The full force of our military.

722
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,933
Well, I wish you would have
consulted first.

723
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,520
- This type of escalation...
- Not escalation, Cathy. Obliteration.

724
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,649
This is
your response to the article?

725
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,109
We're doing what's necessary.

726
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,411
When you find them...
you will kill them.

727
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,207
If we're able to apprehend alive,
we may get...

728
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,252
I understand, Mr. President.

729
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,755
Sir?

730
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,137
I wanna be 100%.
I can give you that.

731
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,182
But it's gonna be a lot harder if I...

732
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,060
If you want me here by your side,
I will be.

733
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,312
- But I'd prefer...
- No.

734
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,858
You do what you have to do.
Be back when it's over.

735
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,860
I will.
Thank you, sir.

736
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,631
- Hey.
- Hey.

737
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,217
Do you want to come inside?

738
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,262
- The kids there?
- Yeah.

739
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,474
- You're not letting them watch...
- No.

740
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,310
No, I forbade them to.

741
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,274
Although, I mean, with school and...
and their friends,

742
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,443
it'll be impossible to prevent if...

743
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,279
if they really wanna see it.

744
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,491
They all right?

745
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,077
Are you all right?

746
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,330
I will be.

747
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,333
I have to be.

748
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,513
All these people in their houses...

749
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,768
about to see this awful thing...

750
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,354
that they'll never be able to erase.

751
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,278
Were you there,
when your husband died?

752
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,990
In the room?

753
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,912
No.

754
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,260
Have you ever watched someone die?

755
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,530
I know you gotta go
back there tonight...

756
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,992
but when you're done...

757
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,577
whenever that is...

758
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,747
you're staying here.

759
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,056
<i>We do this in the name of
the Islamic Caliphate,</i>

760
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,852
<i>in the name of Yusuf Al Ahmadi,
in the name of God.</i>

761
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,896
<i>Melissa, I love you.</i>

762
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,397
<i>Caroline, I love you.</i>

763
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,774
<i>Please, dear God, look out...</i>

764
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,418
Turn off the sound.

765
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,139
That's right.

766
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,226
We don't submit to terror.

767
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,358
We make the terror.
