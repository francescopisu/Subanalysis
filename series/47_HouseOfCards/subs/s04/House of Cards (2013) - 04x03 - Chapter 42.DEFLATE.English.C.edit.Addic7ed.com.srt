John! We're paying you to clean cars,
not read the paper.

00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,825
Yeah, okay. Sorry.

When I think of the goodness of Jesus
and all that He's done for me,

18
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,158
my soul shouts out, "Hallelujah."

19
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,701
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

20
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,915
That was absolutely beautiful.

21
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:13,921
You sang it as heavenly
and as loudly as we do in Dallas. Amen!

22
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,548
Amen.

23
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,138
My mother and I are proud to introduce
a man who fought for you in Congress.

24
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,141
He's fighting for you now
in the White House.

25
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,893
We wanna help him to stay there.

26
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,978
- Amen.
- Amen.

27
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,897
President Frank Underwood!

28
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,273
All right!

29
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,526
Thank you.

30
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,165
You're all wonderful.

31
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,168
Thank you.
Please be seated.

32
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,507
You know, it's on a morning like this,
in a church like yours,

33
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,552
that I'm very proud
to be a South Carolinian.

34
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,725
"How many of you drove to church?

35
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,937
Let me start by asking, how many of you
drove to church here this morning?"

36
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,439
How many of you drove
to get to church here this morning?

37
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,026
And how many of you drove together?

38
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,903
Well, I can appreciate that.

39
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,198
Gas prices right now are putting a strain
on everybody's pocketbooks.

40
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,033
Isn't that true?

41
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,576
I think maybe more here in Gaffney,

42
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,871
at least I feel it here in Gaffney
more than anywhere else.

43
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,372
"Especially here in Gaffney.

44
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,040
Now, as president,
I feel responsible for that.

45
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,292
Or maybe, I feel even more so here.

46
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,711
You know, we've never been a rich town.

47
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,214
You know, a lot of times in my childhood,
I thought to myself,

48
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,259
'Why, we just, we were almost like
an invisible town to people...

49
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,177
We didn't matter.'"

50
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,513
That we didn't matter.

51
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,556
And, of course, I was a white boy.

52
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,809
And as poor as my family was,

53
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,104
we still were a lot better off
than a lot of your families...

54
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,439
who not only had to
struggle through poverty

55
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,275
but had to fight racism as well.

56
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,777
Now, how many of you remember 1973?

57
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,196
"Now, how many of you remember 1973?

58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,908
When gas prices were
as bad as they are today,

59
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,995
and we had to wait hours
just to fill our tank.

60
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:14,499
Why, OPEC was trying
to hold us hostage then

61
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,086
just as Russia's trying
to hold us hostage now.

62
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,963
But somehow...

63
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,799
our little community, why,
we came together, didn't we?

64
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,842
We came together, didn't we?"
Yes.

65
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:29,181
We looked out for each other.
We were there for each other.

66
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,224
Now, maybe we didn't matter
to the rest of the country,

67
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,518
but we sure as heck
mattered to each other.

68
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,896
<i>We're still struggling with poverty,</i>

69
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>and racism is still something
we have to fight against.</i>

70
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,945
<i>But I know that this town does matter.</i>

71
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,490
That all of you matter.

72
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,118
And I don't just say that
because African Americans

73
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,869
represent half the vote in this state.

74
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,667
I say that because,
despite our troubles...

75
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,837
we are one community.

76
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,965
One family.

77
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,342
<i>And that gives us strength.</i>

78
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,847
<i>That strength is a powerful thing.</i>

79
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,225
<i>It's not invisible.</i>

80
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,851
It radiates.

81
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,813
I place my faith in God
to give me purpose.

82
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,444
I put my hope in you to give me strength.

83
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,113
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,407
And come tomorrow,
when you vote...

85
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,535
I hope that you will
place your trust in me...

86
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:38,959
...to help continue to lead this country
as we have led this community, together.

87
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,252
Thank you all very much.

88
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,050
Good morning.

89
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,219
I'm LeAnn Harvey, traveling to Washington.

90
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,845
The First Lady isn't here yet,
Ms. Harvey,

91
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,430
but you're welcome to board the plane,
if you'd like.

92
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,517
Uh, no, I'll wait until she gets here.
Thank you.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,601
Aidan.

94
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,020
<i>Hey,
I just sent the research.</i>

95
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,024
- What's the gist?
- The anger, it's biblical.

96
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,068
- Uh, gas prices?
<i>- Yeah, gas is school.</i>

97
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,694
Gas is work.

98
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,073
Gas is the family trip to Disneyland.

99
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,827
Every cent it goes up
is another six points on the anger index.

100
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,706
We predict that $7 a gallon
will get you riots.

101
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,208
What about the First Lady?

102
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:24,421
<i>Oh, she's faring better than he is.
Sympathy for the sick mother.</i>

103
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,006
Thanks for the rush job on this.

104
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,551
Well, you're a friend.
And this is far more interesting than...

105
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,637
testing names of anti-depressants
for five-year-olds, or...

106
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,224
<i>what color cross trainers
soccer moms will drool over.</i>

107
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,019
- I thought you hated politics.
<i>- I do.</i>

108
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,647
But anger?
And seduction?

109
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,150
Those are interesting.

110
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,032
- Mother, my earrings.
- Yes?

111
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,366
You took them.

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,285
I did no such thing.

113
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,421
I said I don't...

114
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,345
You're taking my money.
I took something of yours.

115
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,517
Claire...

116
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,522
When you leave today,
I don't want you coming back.

117
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,817
Oh, I'll come and go as I please, Mother.

118
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,189
This is unreal.

119
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,940
You sure we can count on this guy?

120
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,985
He loathes Francis.
That we can count on.

121
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,321
But use your best judgment.

122
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,864
Who compiled this?

123
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,285
An analytics firm I contract with,
one of the best in the country.

124
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,413
- They can be trusted?
- Yes. I work directly with the owner.

125
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,334
Francis really needs this win
in South Carolina.

126
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,710
He sure does.

127
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,713
Let's release more
of the strategic reserve.

128
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,091
<i>That might slow down
the price inflation, but it won't halt it.</i>

129
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,345
How are you two ladies
enjoying those ribs?

130
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,598
Mmm, I'm gonna need a nap after this.

131
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,518
Well, you'll have time. I have two hours
of fundraising calls to make.

132
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,188
It was very nice of you to let us
stay at your house, Mr. President.

133
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,064
Well, that's how we do things
here in Gaffney.

134
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,149
<i>Sir?</i>

135
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,610
Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout
if he won't budge on privatization.

136
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,529
If he wants to let his own people starve,
so be it.

137
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,656
<i>He may look for relief from Beijing,
and that would--</i>

138
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,491
The only thing he hates
more than us is China.

139
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,659
He won't kowtow.

140
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>But if Petrov does cave to them,
that puts the global energy--</i>

141
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,955
Look, Cathy, I have to call you back.

142
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,082
- When?
- About 30 minutes ago.

143
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,339
- So this will be your box, number 433.
- Thank you.

144
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,799
Would you like to open up
a savings account with us?

145
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,301
- Debit card?
- No, the box is fine.

146
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,385
Okay.

147
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,430
- Would you mind if I...
- Oh, sure. I'll give you some privacy.

148
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,848
Thank you.

149
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,411
Good to see you.

150
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,621
You, too, Francis.

151
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,789
I'm surprised.

152
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,916
I don't hear from you,
then you just show up.

153
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,670
Mmm, to be honest,
I wasn't sure until I landed.

154
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,092
You've gotten some sun.

155
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,388
Tractor-pulling event yesterday.
I should've worn a hat.

156
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,934
- Are Doris and Celia here?
- They were.

157
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,936
I set up cots for them in the guest room,

158
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,481
but when I heard you were coming,
I sent them off to a hotel.

159
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,649
I figured you'd want
that room for yourself.

160
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,193
That's very thoughtful.

161
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,530
You have an event now.

162
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,866
Limestone College.

163
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,493
Well, I'll join you.

164
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,411
They'll be there,
if you'd rather not see--

165
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,037
It'll be fine.

166
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,458
Unless you'd rather I not go.

167
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,251
No, I'd love you to come.

168
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,841
- If he knows I'm involved...
- So make sure he doesn't.

169
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,719
Can I see it?

170
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,855
Oh, boy.

171
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,360
Now, this could get interesting.

172
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,194
We need it done by tomorrow morning.

173
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,492
Well, my cousin has a friend,
owns an industrial print shop,

174
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,868
but a job that size...

175
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,537
This should cover it.

176
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,462
And then some.

177
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,173
Oh, I didn't know Heather Dunbar
had it in her.

178
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,467
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Chase.

179
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,555
Well, are you sure you wouldn't
like some iced tea?

180
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,598
Thank you, no.
I should get going.

181
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,396
How about some fries with that shake?

182
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,610
Get done what I want done.
Don't make me come back here.

183
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,264
- What did Manny say?
- I got your shift, bro.

184
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,309
- What about the car?
- The Fusion.

185
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,145
I can reset the odometer,
park it in front of your place after work.

186
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,607
But, hey...
you gotta get it back by tomorrow night.

187
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,150
- Otherwise, when they do the inventory--
- I promise you.

188
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,736
All right.

189
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,238
So the cost.

190
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,448
As soon as I get my paycheck, I'll--

191
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,075
No. I don't want money.

192
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,414
Most of the other guys work here,
they ain't much to look at.

193
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,709
You?

194
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,503
Keep lookin' over.

195
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,631
Hey, man, listen...

196
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,467
- You want the car or not?
- I'll find some other way.

197
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,888
Yo.

198
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,849
I know about you.

199
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
I seen your parole officer
come check in on you.

200
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,564
What would he say about
you taking one of these cars?

201
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,487
Come on.

202
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,490
Get in.

203
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,182
I just learned today
that Limestone College,

204
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,684
founded in 1845,

205
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,729
was the first women's college
in South Carolina,

206
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,606
and one of the first in the nation.

207
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,441
And that's something to be proud of.

208
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:13,616
And since then, this school
and its students have flourished.

209
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,914
A young, eager community of men and women
of all races and backgrounds,

210
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,750
a true reflection of America's future.

211
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,423
How did he convince you to come back?

212
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,385
I convinced myself.

213
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,139
Forty-six years I was married
to my husband before he passed.

214
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,852
But if he'd pulled on me
what Frank pulled on you,

215
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,812
he would've been long gone.

216
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,773
I think it's worked out for the best.

217
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,275
Your daughter is going to make
a fabulous congresswoman.

218
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,986
Well, thank you.

219
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,239
Two minutes.

220
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,408
Now, Frank Underwood understands
the need for equality,

221
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,829
in education and throughout our lives.

222
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,083
Most of all, he believes
in giving every American

223
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,128
the opportunity to earn a living.

224
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,923
He put this belief into action before
and he will again,

225
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:16,012
and Frank Underwood will not allow
this journey to end with Limestone.

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,850
You will go out into this world
and astonish us all with your intellect,

227
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,645
your... your worthiness,
and your strength.

228
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,111
Now, I would like to introduce
two of the strongest women I know.

229
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,031
Well, don't you look thick as thieves.

230
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,994
...and the First Lady
of the United States, Claire Underwood.

231
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,712
It's as though she never left.

232
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,505
And that's what I'm afraid of.

233
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,611
All right,
let's hurry on up, now.

234
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,663
Bugayev is telling me
that they are willing

235
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:28,000
to reduce their oil output by another 20%
by the first of next month.

236
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,336
What are the projections on gas prices?

237
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,463
<i>North of 150 a barrel for oil.</i>

238
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,924
Six, maybe $7 a gallon for fuel.

239
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,093
My phone has been
ringing off the hook, sir,

240
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,803
from the U.K. to Poland.

241
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>The IMF wants to help us
with the debt relief solution.</i>

242
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>Sir?</i>

243
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,253
We need to respond to strength
with strength.

244
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,213
Well, I don't know how
we could be any stronger,

245
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,091
other than to invade Russia.

246
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,720
And what if we do?

247
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,432
- Excuse me, sir?
<i>- Not with troops.</i>

248
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,351
With fear.

249
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,853
He's never trusted us.

250
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,647
He already thinks
we're behind Milkin's failed coup.

251
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,400
What if we put Milkin
in a position to succeed.

252
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,111
<i>Now, I don't care
if Milkin actually succeeds.</i>

253
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:41,073
<i>Unfreeze all his assets.
Fly him to a border country.</i>

254
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,785
Put him in a room with other dissidents.

255
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,830
Petrov needs to know
that we'll stop at nothing.

256
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,417
Sir, the diplomatic repercussions
of such an action--

257
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,585
All I want is the appearance.

258
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,923
Let's look at best and worst case
scenarios as soon as possible.

259
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,132
Thank you very much.

260
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,770
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were--

261
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,982
That bed was too stiff.

262
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,318
- I'll sleep in there then.
- Sleep in here.

263
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,135
We had the mattress on the floor.

264
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,386
What?

265
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,806
That first year,
the mattress and those lumpy pillows.

266
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,895
Which you used to steal from me
in the middle of the night.

267
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,730
Well, because you would hog
all the covers.

268
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
God, we were living like heathens.

269
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,070
Well, because we were
spending everything we had on the race.

270
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,992
I remember I used to think this place
was a palace, though.

271
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,289
- It was.
- Not compared to the ranch.

272
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,208
Well, it was a palace because it was ours.

273
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,921
Good night, Francis.

274
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,870
The press has surrounded the house.

275
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,999
I can't leave the damn place
until I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

276
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,125
We need to cancel your events.

277
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,667
Of course we need to cancel my events.

278
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,212
- The expression on my face is a--
- What's going on?

279
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,796
<i>...taken in a nondescript location,</i>

280
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,716
<i>does not seem to be
a direct endorsement for the KKK.</i>

281
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,344
- My God.
- My father.

282
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,474
Sir? Congresswoman Jones
is heading back to Texas.

283
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,894
Get her on the phone for me, right now.
Meechum, I need you to do me a favor.

284
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,271
<i>There are no clues at the moment</i>

285
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,148
<i>as to who may be responsible,</i>

286
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,442
<i>but Gaffney PD is taking
the canvas picture down</i>

287
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,903
<i>within the hour for further examination.</i>

288
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,906
On primary day.

289
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,368
I can't verify anything yet
in terms of who it is,

290
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,412
or even whether it's real, or--

291
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,211
The day before New Hampshire,
there's a marriage story,

292
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,130
and now in South Carolina we have this?

293
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,674
Uh, how are we getting blindsided?

294
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,510
- I should get that--
- Let it ring.

295
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,930
Look...

296
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,016
I didn't even know about
the fight until you told me.

297
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,061
And how was I supposed
to know about this photo?

298
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,646
Because it is your job
to get out ahead of this shit.

299
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,524
The oppo team should've tracked this down.
That's the campaign.

300
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,610
So, if Vaughn didn't know,
or the president didn't tell him...

301
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,988
It has to be somebody close to him.
Someone with a lot of access.

302
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,617
The president's on the line.

303
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,167
Sir, it's Doug.
I'm in here with Seth.

304
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,961
I'm gonna tell the truth.
I'm gonna say it is my father.

305
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,379
<i>That's probably
the best response,</i>

306
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,714
<i>if you have a good way to frame it.</i>

307
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,092
I know what to say.
The question is where.

308
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,844
One-on-one.
Something exclusive.

309
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,597
Not in front of the media.
I need to connect directly to the voters,

310
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,931
the African American voters.

311
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,725
Mr. President,
I've got the Secretary of State.

312
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,352
I'll call her back.

313
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,312
Hang on, boys.
Meechum?

314
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,606
It's here, sir.

315
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,773
<i>What can you tell me?</i>

316
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,736
Yesterday, a woman named Leslie McIntyre
opened a new box.

317
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,614
<i>I'm having the name run now,
but it looks like she used a fake social.</i>

318
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,407
What about security footage?

319
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,700
<i>They reset the cameras every morning.</i>

320
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,868
I asked what she looked like

321
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
and all the manager said
is that it was a Caucasian brunette.

322
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,497
Nothing strange about her.

323
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,167
All right. Bring the box back here.
Don't let it out of your sight.

324
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,964
As far as I know,
there's only one photograph.

325
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,799
<i>Meechum says it's still at the bank.</i>

326
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,512
Sir, it's just me.

327
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,182
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

328
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,475
Yes, sir.

329
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,561
<i>Well, you keep an eye on him.</i>

330
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,194
I want emails and phone records
of everyone in the White House.

331
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,280
Including yours.

332
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,365
Mine?
You honestly think--

333
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,450
Is there a problem?

334
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,618
No.

335
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,204
Good.

336
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,545
<i>It's unfortunate.</i>

337
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,297
<i>Ms. Dunbar!
Ms. Dunbar? Ms. Dunbar?</i>

338
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,714
<i>The imagery...</i>

339
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,885
<i>That anyone would try to inflame
racial discord by doing something so base.</i>

340
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,263
<i>Whether it's Calvin Underwood
isn't the point.</i>

341
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,098
<i>If it is,
and we have no confirmation on that,</i>

342
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,851
<i>I mean...
Who put this up? And why?</i>

343
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:29,481
<i>Who knows. And the sins of the father
aren't necessarily the sins of the son.</i>

344
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,651
<i>But... it's troubling.
Very troubling.</i>

345
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,113
<i>Stunts like these have the potential
to open old wounds.</i>

346
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,451
<i>We can't let that happen.
We need to rise above it.</i>

347
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,370
<i>Make clear,
no matter who you support,</i>

348
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,914
<i>that this sort of behavior
will not be tolerated.</i>

349
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,250
Get me Reverend Clark
and Gene Clancy on the phone.

350
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,399
Hey, they want you out by the bus.

351
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,567
By the bus?

352
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,319
- Um, who are you?
- Sorry.

353
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,862
Mark from the Butler County office.

354
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,280
They want all the Cincinnati volunteers

355
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,156
to gather by the bus
for a photo with Dunbar.

356
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,908
Jenn told me I wasn't supposed to leave--

357
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,495
That's why she sent me.
She didn't want you to miss the photo. Go.

358
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,204
Out by the bus?

359
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,623
She told me to cover for you.

360
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,875
Okay, um...

361
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,337
well, there were a couple of no-shows,
but, you know, otherwise, everyone's here.

362
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,631
- Okay. Thanks.
- Very convenient. Thanks.

363
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,840
Enjoy.

364
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,671
I'm David Grimes
with the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer.</i>

365
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,714
Where's your credential?

366
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,216
I was an idiot and left it in the car.

367
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,929
They recognized me
at the check-in desk, though.

368
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,140
I can direct you to the bullpen,
but this area is off-limits to the press.

369
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,268
I'm actually supposed to do an interview
with Cynthia Driscoll.

370
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,978
The Advance guys
said I should come this way.

371
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,565
Wait here.

372
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,993
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
we just can't do it.

373
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,871
Forty-five percent of the vote here
is African American.

374
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,249
You and your mother standing by my side
would go a long way to put this--

375
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:57,087
I am running for Congress
in a black and Latino district.

376
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,674
My mother was beaten
and hosed down in marches.

377
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,135
You want us to vouch for a man
whose father was in the KKK?

378
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,222
- No, he was not in the Klan.
<i>- That was him in that picture.</i>

379
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,682
Yes, but I've explained that.

380
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,601
<i>This is the state
where the Civil War started,</i>

381
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,061
where you can still see
rebel flags on bumper stickers.

382
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:17,566
There is a history
of racist brutality here, Mr. President.

383
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,485
Those sort of symbols matter.

384
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,195
<i>Could you put your mother on, please?</i>

385
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,617
Mom?

386
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,369
He wants to speak to you.

387
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,790
Mr. President.

388
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,711
Listen, we need to stand together.
Now, I've endorsed Celia.

389
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,755
Claire can do a great deal
for her in Texas.

390
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,216
She's better off
without the Underwoods at this point.

391
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,718
But what about your clinic?

392
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,096
<i>Imagine how that would look,
holding our clinic for ransom.</i>

393
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,099
I'm appealing to your goodwill,
Congresswoman.

394
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,020
When we stop getting beaten and shot...

395
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,273
you'll have my goodwill, Mr. President.

396
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,651
Goodbye.

397
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,242
Get me Gene Clancy again.

398
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,748
What if it's Oren Chase, Francis?

399
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,084
He could've gotten his hands on a copy.
There may be more than one.

400
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,380
Meechum first, then Clancy.

401
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,470
Lucas?

402
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,515
We need to talk.

403
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,975
- I thought you were--
- I was. I'm... I'm out now.

404
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,603
This is important.

405
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,148
Mr. President, was your father a racist?

406
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,365
Was your father a racist?

407
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,871
Mrs. Underwood,
is your mother okay?

408
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,291
Mr. President!

409
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,798
- Mr. Chase?
- Who are you?

410
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,967
United States Secret Service.

411
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,761
We're not after you, Mr. Chase.
We're after whoever put you up to it.

412
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,430
Put me up to what?

413
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,975
You can answer me here, or we can go to
the Columbia field office for questioning.

414
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,351
I have no idea what you're talking about.

415
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,103
All right,
I need you to come with me, sir.

416
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
- Now, hold on.
- Step outside, sir.

417
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,649
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

418
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,736
- I need backup at 4126.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

419
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,363
- Come on, that's not necessary.
- Not if you cooperate, sir.

420
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,618
If I talk to you,
I won't get in trouble?

421
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,538
I swear to God, Ms. Dunbar.
It's all true.

422
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,664
Then where's the proof?

423
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,084
I don't have the means,
but you do.

424
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,419
You've investigated him before.
You know he's dangerous.

425
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,505
Mr. Goodwin--

426
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,256
Why would he go after me
if I wasn't onto something?

427
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,092
This was a high-level sting operation.

428
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,595
Major resources were dedicated to it.

429
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,346
I'm... I was a journalist,
no criminal record.

430
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,265
How am I suddenly such a threat,
unless I'm--

431
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,808
Even if I did believe you,

432
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,311
I am no longer part of the DOJ.
I am a private citizen now.

433
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,105
Who's running for president--

434
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,315
Aren't you breaking WITSEC protocol
by being here?

435
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,901
I am no longer comfortable with this.

436
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,153
- You're... you're my last chance. Please!
- Hey, hey.

437
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,196
- I suggest that you go back home.
- I'm... The things I've--

438
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,658
- Don't make us get security involved.
- Please. Just--

439
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,118
Just give us five minutes
until she's out of the building.

440
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,579
Please.
Please listen to me.

441
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,831
I'm... I'm begging you.

442
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,708
Just help me...

443
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,334
Help.

444
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,803
Please, please...

445
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,848
Oh, God...

446
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,185
How could you put me in a room with him?

447
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,895
I didn't know what he was gonna say.

448
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,814
But I assumed that
if he went to such great lengths--

449
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,067
The DUI, that's all he has proof of.
That's nothing.

450
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,902
Even I have helped people
get off for that.

451
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,613
- There's the affair...
- With no evidence.

452
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,990
Then he leaps to murder...
Two murders?

453
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,992
The man is troubled.

454
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,744
We saw the look in his eye.

455
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,371
I thought he might have
something real.

456
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,915
He used to be a good editor.

457
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,042
And now he is a convicted felon.

458
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,794
You said no stone unturned.

459
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm sorry,
I should have thought better of it.

460
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,801
Yes, you should have.

461
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,973
Let's let it go.
How are we doing in South Carolina?

462
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,683
Early exit polls are good.

463
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,978
- We have a shot at winning.
- Actually winning?

464
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,021
That billboard's done real damage.

465
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,738
I appreciate you doing this, Gene.
You're really saving my life here.

466
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,240
Just remember it
when I run for county executive.

467
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,200
I'll be down here whenever you need me.

468
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,245
Oh, it's not the when, it's the what.
And how much.

469
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,626
Afternoon, Oren.

470
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,586
- Mr. President.
- Have a seat.

471
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,594
Didn't you learn your lesson
with all that Peachoid nonsense?

472
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,598
Well, you promised
to help me with the 4th.

473
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,771
I let my bitterness get the better of me.

474
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,063
Mmm-hmm.

475
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,191
Who specifically approached you?
A woman?

476
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,277
- Brunette?
- Yeah.

477
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,364
Uh, about so tall, good-looking.

478
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,033
Wouldn't give me her name.

479
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,242
We should get photos

480
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,870
of everyone in Dunbar's staff
that fits that description.

481
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,496
Already compiling it, ma'am.

482
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,501
And as for you...

483
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,546
you're gonna plant yourself
in front of as many TV cameras

484
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,674
that can gather around
that bony ass of yours.

485
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,592
You're gonna be wracked with guilt
and overcome with conscience.

486
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,470
And you do that and I'll make sure
that you aren't charged.

487
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,472
You want me to say it was Dunbar?

488
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,559
Come on, be smarter than that, Oren.
She'll sue you for slander.

489
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,145
Just say you were bought and
people will connect the dots on their own.

490
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,065
Get him out of here.

491
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,945
I hope you don't welsh on your promise
to me the way you did with Oren.

492
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:59,615
You're family, Gene.
I would never betray one of the family.

493
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,034
Shall we?

494
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,412
Ready?

495
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,040
<i>Many of you voted for me for mayor</i>

496
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,418
<i>because you've known me your whole lives.</i>

497
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,714
<i>Well, I've known Frank Underwood
my whole life.</i>

498
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,632
He's my friend and I trust him,

499
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,635
and I don't care what's on that billboard.

500
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,013
I'm proud he's my president,

501
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,225
and I'm proud to have...
be standing with him here today.

502
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,819
Thank you, Gene.

503
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,909
Yesterday, I stood in this church...

504
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,787
and I talked about community.

505
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,039
I talked about our collective strength,

506
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,085
black and white,
coming together during times of crisis.

507
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,256
And today there's probably a lot of you
who think I'm a hypocrite.

508
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:07,475
How can a man whose father was in the KKK
stand up here and mean the things he said?

509
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,437
Yes, that is my father in that photograph,
I'm not going to deny it.

510
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,024
But the truth is he wasn't in the Klan.

511
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,153
The year that photo was taken,

512
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:23,283
my father needed $5,000
to pay off our debts,

513
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,787
or the bank was gonna
foreclose on our farm.

514
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:32,542
Now, my father went to every other bank
within a hundred miles of here,

515
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,419
and no one would give him a loan.

516
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,131
He asked friends, he asked family,
but nobody had that kind of money.

517
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,842
And we were about to lose everything.

518
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:45,513
Now, at the time,
the owner of the Gaffney First Bank

519
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,973
was a member of the Klan.

520
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,266
Some of you know that.

521
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,520
And he would do whatever the Klan
told him to do, and my father knew that.

522
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,816
So my father did what he had to do.

523
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,444
<i>He went to a meeting
and begged the leader of that chapter</i>

524
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,487
<i>to talk to the owner of the bank.</i>

525
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,075
<i>And at that meeting,
that's when that photograph was taken.</i>

526
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,412
<i>The only reason he was there
was to try to save our farm.</i>

527
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:14,167
Now, Calvin Underwood
hated himself for going to that meeting.

528
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,086
He hated himself
for taking that photograph.

529
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:20,048
But he would've hated himself even more
if he'd lost our farm...

530
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,136
if he hadn't been able to provide
and support his family.

531
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,975
Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you
to forgive him being in that photograph.

532
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,310
He probably thought
no one would ever see it.

533
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,648
But I am asking you
to empathize with his predicament.

534
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,568
And ask yourselves...

535
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,614
what would you do to save your family?

536
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,326
Now, whoever stole that photograph
and vandalized that billboard,

537
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,371
they're not trying to unearth
some big scandal about my past,

538
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,663
'cause it just isn't true.

539
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,583
What they're trying to do is divide us.

540
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,252
What they really wanna succeed in doing

541
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,921
is making sure
you don't vote for me today.

542
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:05,593
They've gone to a whole lot of trouble
to make me look pretty bad.

543
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,470
But that's politics.

544
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,807
My hope in coming here today...

545
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,686
and speaking openly
and honestly about this...

546
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,606
is that we can stay united.

547
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,486
So my plan is to stay here
as long as it takes,

548
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,239
to speak to each one of you individually,

549
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,409
and answer every question
that you might have.

550
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,912
Thank you very much.

551
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,796
Thank you very much, ma'am.

552
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,173
<i>President Underwood, speaking live</i>

553
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,758
<i>in his home town of Gaffney,
South Carolina,</i>

554
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,554
<i>addressing claims that his father
was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

555
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,515
<i>A billboard there was vandalized
late last night</i>

556
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,436
<i>with a photo of his father
standing next to a man in Klan robes</i>

557
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,772
<i>with the caption, "Underwood 2016."</i>

558
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,984
<i>As we've just seen,
the president did not deny allegations</i>

559
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,987
<i>that his father had some connection
to the organization,</i>

560
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,574
<i>instead explaining that Calvin Underwood
attended one meeting</i>

561
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,703
<i>as a last resort to save
his family's peach farm from foreclosure.</i>

562
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,957
<i>The president was subject
to widespread criticism</i>

563
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>after news of his family's alleged
Klan connection broke this morning.</i>

564
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,213
<i>Today's primary result will show--</i>

565
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,217
<i>I don't know her name.
I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.</i>

566
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,427
<i>And I deeply regret that I allowed</i>

567
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,932
<i>my political leanings
to compromise my better judgment.</i>

568
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,560
<i>I want to apologize
to anyone I might have offended</i>

569
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,606
<i>by hoisting up such painful imagery.</i>

570
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,483
We're getting calls asking if it was us.

571
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,527
- Do you think someone from our team--
- Absolutely not.

572
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,030
I think Underwood put this guy up to it.

573
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,324
He's trying to turn this
back around on us.

574
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,369
We need to deny, forcefully.

575
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,871
I'm already putting a press avail together
at your next event.

576
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,126
Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.

577
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,505
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm not sure.

578
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,885
Mmm.

579
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,679
Look at this.

580
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,023
It came from the goddamn White House!

581
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,482
We're questioning
the photographer now, sir.

582
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,235
I've got a statement prepared
that this was a run-of-the-mill event,

583
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,695
that you took photos
with lots of re-enactors.

584
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,614
<i>It doesn't matter
how you spin it.</i>

585
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,618
I just stood in front of a group
of African Americans in a church,

586
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,037
asking them to believe in me.

587
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,414
It's bad enough
they see my father next to a Klansman.

588
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,125
Now they see me
next to a symbol of slavery.

589
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,921
<i>I wanna find out who's leaking this shit,
and I want their head on a goddamn stake!</i>

590
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,885
Sir, I have a theory.

591
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,763
I think...

592
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,934
Well, I think it might be Edward Meechum.

593
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,020
<i>Meechum?</i>

594
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,272
He knew about the argument
between you and the First Lady.

595
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,107
<i>He was there on that trip to Virginia.</i>

596
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,860
- He would never do something like this.
<i>- Dunbar has a lot of money.</i>

597
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,321
Put out a statement to the networks

598
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,239
that I won't be giving
a concession speech.

599
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,658
Sir... don't you think that might
look like you're running from--

600
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,495
I just lost my home state.
I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.

601
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,170
Meechum?

602
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,256
I'm not ruling anyone out.

603
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,890
Sir?

604
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,022
I brought the safety deposit box for you.

605
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,858
You can put it down.

606
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,654
- Meechum.
- Yes, sir?

607
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,408
Have I given you any reason to hurt me?

608
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,160
Hurt you, sir?

609
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:03,248
Have I done you wrong in any way?

610
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,833
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

611
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,303
Look me in the eyes, Meechum.

612
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,555
- Sir...
- Meechum, shh.

613
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,291
Are you all right, sir?

614
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,000
I've been better.

615
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,713
I'm still on duty.

616
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,770
Is there...

617
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,439
anything I can do?

618
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,483
You could go out
and stuff some ballot boxes for me.

619
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,029
- You'll bounce back from this.
- I sure hope I can.

620
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,494
Uh, when I got fired...

621
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,913
from the Capitol Police...

622
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,541
I mean, I know it doesn't compare, but...

623
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,211
I felt pretty bad.

624
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,339
I thought my career was over.

625
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,342
Then you turned everything around.

626
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,680
You don't get second chances in elections.

627
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,806
I know.

628
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,976
But there's a lot of primaries ahead.

629
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,731
All I'm saying is it's not over.
You'll get through this.

630
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,238
- I'm sorry, that must sound so stupid.
- No, it doesn't.

631
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,865
I appreciate it.

632
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,791
I'll be out by the motorcade, sir,
if you need anything.

633
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,378
Thank you, Meechum.

634
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,069
I knew it, but I didn't wanna believe it.

635
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,555
It's only a wound.

636
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,223
It's not fatal.

637
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,934
My home state, Claire.

638
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,019
Have a seat.

639
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,563
I end your race so you end mine?

640
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,315
- Let me explain, Francis.
- Spite, revenge!

641
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,943
Please, sit down.
We need to talk.

642
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,491
Nothing is going to come
from anger right now.

643
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,013
Last night when we were talking,
you called this house a palace.

644
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,641
This is where we began.

645
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,102
And do you remember
when my mother almost left Daddy

646
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,730
because he funded your campaign?

647
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,400
That's how much she hated you.

648
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,734
But I didn't care,

649
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,236
because I saw something.
I saw a future.

650
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,406
Our future.

651
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,492
We had a future
until you started destroying it.

652
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,661
Well, you wouldn't have
listened otherwise.

653
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,871
I always listen to you.

654
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,041
Only when it's what you want to hear.

655
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,671
Well, all right, Claire.
I'm listening now.

656
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:05,090
What is it you so desperately
needed to say?

657
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:10,345
We've never lost a race in 30 years.
We started here and we've always won.

658
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,931
You and I, together.

659
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,892
But you are losing, Francis.

660
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,269
People are getting killed
at the gas pumps.

661
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,731
America Works is falling flat.

662
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:24,652
Your campaign manager
is ten years behind ten years ago.

663
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,362
You don't have a viable running mate.

664
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,281
We both know it can't be Donald Blythe.

665
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,492
Well, of course not.

666
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:35,120
But I have to win the goddamn nomination
before I can start worrying about winning.

667
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:38,499
Even if I hadn't done what I did,
your race is in real trouble.

668
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,751
You need me, Francis.

669
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,963
My approvals are higher than yours.

670
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,965
I can help you win Texas.

671
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,968
Exactly. Which is why
I didn't want you running in Dallas.

672
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,553
I need you at my side.

673
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,888
Yes, but in a different way.

674
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,849
Different how?

675
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,102
We make each other stronger,
can we agree to that?

676
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,814
When it's working,
but it's not working.

677
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,440
We can make it work.

678
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,696
We can accomplish that future
I saw when we first got married.

679
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:13,158
It was us, as partners, real partners.

680
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,245
Let's run together, again.

681
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,372
Not just as husband and wife.

682
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,214
You don't mean...

683
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,133
Yes.

684
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,805
I'm worried about you, Claire.

685
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,977
You're not making any sense.
You've let your ego get in the way--

686
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,896
I've always been your running mate.

687
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,732
- You just didn't wanna see it.
- As my vice president?

688
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,401
- Jesus. Do you have any idea--
- I've put a lot of thought into this.

689
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,485
You can't have thought it through.

690
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,947
- You'd come up with a million reasons--
- She's never run for anything.

691
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,367
No children, nepotism, arrogance,
I've run through them all.

692
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,622
You can't win without me.

693
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,878
I would rather have a spineless
Donald Blythe as my vice president

694
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,631
than a woman
who's never held elected office.

695
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,052
You're losing to a woman
who's never held elected office.

696
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,513
You don't deserve it.

697
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:21,143
You have no idea
what it means to have nothing.

698
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,605
You don't value what we have achieved.

699
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:29,359
I have had to fight for everything
my entire life.

700
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,950
Do you know why I kept this?

701
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,327
Do you know?

702
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,915
Because it's the one time
I was proud of my father.

703
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:47,294
Because this man, in this moment,
as despicable as it was,

704
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,046
is fighting to survive.

705
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,593
He is doing whatever it took.

706
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,470
And so will I, with or without you.

707
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:01,016
So no, I will not have this conversation.
I will not indulge you any further.

708
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,352
You have to let this go.

709
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,772
I can be a part of your campaign,
or I can end it.

710
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,111
I'll do whatever it takes, too.
Just like your father.

711
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,239
But I will not let this go.

712
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,917
I'll need a car to the Greenville Airport.

713
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,544
To Dallas, yes.

714
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:45,746
