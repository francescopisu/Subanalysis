2
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:53,030
China provides 40% of the bailout,
the IMF provides another 40%

3
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,575
and a consortium of American
and Chinese energy companies

4
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,119
tackles the remaining 20%,

5
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,706
in exchange for which
they get drilling rights.

6
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,501
The US would only have
to contribute 150 of the $800 billion.

7
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,755
Russian companies would oversee production
and get a slice of the revenues.

8
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,799
These are the proposed development zones.

9
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,217
We split the drilling rights?

10
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,555
Yes, sir. China puts in more money,
but we contribute our drilling technology.

11
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,349
Should we really be sharing that?

12
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,143
They're already trying
to hack it from us.

13
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,853
Has Petrov agreed to this?

14
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,898
I'm planning to propose it to him
in Brandenburg at the G7 Summit.

15
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,818
We've invited Russia and China to attend,

16
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,487
but we didn't wanna move forward
until we had congressional approval.

17
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,950
- Bob?
- We should discuss privately.

18
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,743
You're going to Brandenburg yourself?

19
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,789
If his health continues to worsen--

20
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,459
We'll assess as we get closer,
but, no, I'll stay here if it looks dire.

21
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,212
We should probably draft
an appropriation

22
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,339
in case we need to pay
for a state funeral.

23
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,836
- Doug.
- Madam Secretary.

24
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,049
I could've come to the White House.

25
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,721
The organ network, it answers to you.

26
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,141
Yes and no.
Uh, in a regulatory capacity--

27
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,518
You have the power to modify
the recipient list.

28
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,561
That's up to the network.

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,188
They have an expert committee that--

30
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,900
The president's life isn't going to be
decided by a committee.

31
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,652
Let me show you something.

32
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,121
He was number three yesterday.
Number one got a transplant.

33
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,500
Makes the president number two.
His chances are very good.

34
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,088
But this man, Anthony Moretti,
he's just hours away from dying.

35
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,173
Then let him die.

36
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,804
I'm not doing this.

37
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,889
It's not just the law.
It's the ethics--

38
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,891
Then change your ethics.

39
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,518
Or you can resign,
and your deputy can make this call.

40
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,396
And if he won't,
then he can resign, too.

41
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,024
I will strip away this entire department
until I find who I need.

42
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,990
Now make the call.

43
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,037
- Okay, I'm on.
<i>- You ever use it?</i>

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,872
No, I use Google.

45
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,209
Uh, it's a small market share, but still,
it's billions of searches a month.

46
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,253
Now, what if a certain candidate
got more hits,

47
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,174
<i>was ranked higher, more positive coverage
favored over negative coverage?</i>

48
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,969
What if that candidate
was William Conway?

49
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,473
<i>Manipulating searches?
The public would turn on them.</i>

50
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,434
- It gets them millions of votes.
- Can you get me solid proof?

51
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,561
<i>Well, I am not getting involved
in something like this.</i>

52
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,481
<i>What I will give you is advice
as a friend.</i>

53
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,150
Don't waste a year of your life
on the Underwoods.

54
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,238
<i>They've already lost the election
and they don't even realize it.</i>

55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,074
I know you're only trying to help,

56
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,035
and I'm sure you must feel
frightened about Frank's condition--

57
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,661
You don't have to be delicate, Cathy.

58
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,915
I'd like you to let me do my job.

59
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,585
China cannot be at the center
of this negotiation, or Raymond Tusk.

60
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,463
Involving the oil companies
is the only shot we have

61
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,215
at winning Republican support.

62
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,303
Do you remember when we played beer pong
and you let me win?

63
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,598
The two of us were sitting
right over there, in those two chairs,

64
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,018
and you asked me for my advice.

65
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,352
It was good advice.

66
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,854
And you listened to it.
I don't know why you won't now.

67
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,150
You were proposing a way forward.
This time you're not.

68
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,486
Well, unlike you,
my nomination was confirmed by the Senate,

69
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,906
because they believed
I knew what I was doing.

70
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,698
Forgive me, Claire,
but it seems to me

71
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,035
that you are taking advantage
of the situation

72
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,120
to assert authority
you don't have a right to assert.

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,205
Cathy, you don't have Francis right now.

74
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,958
I'm the best thing you've got,
so please work with me on this.

75
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:19,296
Congress will never approve this.
You're just wasting everybody's time.

76
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,008
- The Republicans will get in line.
- Not the Republicans, the Democrats.

77
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,971
I spoke to Jackie Sharp.
When she heard you developed this plan...

78
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,935
She's a formidable woman, Claire,
and very persuasive.

79
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>- Remy Danton.</i>
- Remy, we need to talk about Jackie.

80
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,716
Such a nice night.

81
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,010
Let's go somewhere outside.

82
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,762
And where do you wanna go?

83
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,598
Take me to the bay.

84
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,808
We'll go skinny-dipping.

85
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,729
- I thought you only had a couple hours.
- I'll make up some excuse.

86
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,231
I'm sick of hotel rooms.

87
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,318
We both got a big day tomorrow.

88
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,820
Why are you being no fun?

89
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,531
Because you're trying to kill my bill.

90
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,368
You didn't wanna see me.
You wanted to lobby me.

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,828
- Jackie, listen--
- Who told you I was against it?

92
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,041
Birch's Chief of Staff.

93
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,502
Well, I'm sure you stand to make
a lot of money on this, but--

94
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,964
- It's not about the money.
- Isn't that how Claire convinced you?

95
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,802
I just wanted to leave it tonight.
I didn't wanna be mad at you.

96
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,305
I just wanted...

97
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,271
I don't understand why you're helping her.

98
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,232
You've gotta get Birch on board.

99
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,986
The Underwoods have lied to me,

100
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,904
they've used me,
they've tried to intimidate me.

101
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,239
I don't know what Claire's up to,

102
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,991
but I'm not gonna let it happen
without a fight,

103
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,700
not with the State Department against it.

104
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,202
Claire knows.

105
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,580
About you and me.

106
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,001
She got photographs of us

107
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,212
leaving the same hotel at the same time,
multiple occasions.

108
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,551
Take me back to my car.

109
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,638
- Jackie, listen--
- Turn around now, please.

110
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,308
It's the reason I haven't been in touch.

111
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,560
I wanted to protect you...
but she's making--

112
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,853
I don't wanna talk about it.

113
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,731
Just stop the car and let me out
or drive me back.

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,984
I'll take you back.

115
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,616
A day or two.

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,327
We might not have much warning,
Mr. President.

117
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,995
When the liver is this close to failure,
things can happen suddenly.

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,248
You should be prepared.

119
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,210
- What's happening with his hands?
- It's called asterixis.

120
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,504
It happens when the body
can't clear ammonia.

121
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,381
Thank you, Dr. Saxon.

122
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,915
I'm not going to Brandenburg.

123
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,126
No, you have to.

124
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,254
- Cathy will negotiate on my behalf.
- I don't trust her on this.

125
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,173
That's a risk we'll have to take.

126
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,385
The risk I won't take is being overseas
if the president dies.

127
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,471
We don't even know if Congress will
approve the appropriation for the bailout.

128
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,765
They will approve it.
I'll make sure they do.

129
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,061
You shouldn't be worrying
about this now, Claire.

130
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,979
You should be focused on Frank.

131
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,456
We need to put him

132
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,999
on the ventilator to protect his airways.

133
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,377
You should go, ma'am.
Go get some rest.

134
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,523
<i>♪ Pretty Polly ♪</i>

135
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,983
<i>♪ Would you take me unkind? ♪</i>

136
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,156
<i>♪ Tell you my mind ♪</i>

137
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,839
Shh.

138
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,686
- Now's not a good time, LeAnn.
- This can't wait.

139
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,688
- What is it?
- Pollyhop.

140
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,149
- The search engine?
- Conway is working with them.

141
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,569
They can manipulate
what people search for.

142
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,820
It gives them a huge advantage--

143
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,988
Wait, slow down.
What does this mean?

144
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,656
It means that we lose.

145
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,033
Conway's name, his image,

146
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,828
they can control what people see.
They can force-feed it.

147
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,037
Even if they're not doing that,

148
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,874
even if they're just tracking users,
it's enough to beat us.

149
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,335
You know what people are searching for,
you know everything,

150
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,295
their hopes, their fears,
what they're thinking about

151
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,757
when they're staring at the ceiling
in the middle of the night.

152
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,217
- Who told you this?
- Someone I trust.

153
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,846
I can't deal with this right now.

154
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,806
We have to do something, Claire,
or the election--

155
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,684
LeAnn, my husband just had a seizure.
There may not even be an election.

156
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,852
I'm sorry. I--

157
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,062
If Francis survives,
we will deal with this then.

158
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,232
Right now, I need to focus
on what's right in front of me.

159
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,571
There was no criminal wrongdoing.

160
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,323
That we can fathom.
But why take the chance?

161
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,785
Because pleading the Fifth
makes it look like I broke the law.

162
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,077
I agree.

163
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,331
So I'll tell the truth.
I'll own it.

164
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,626
Yes, that you didn't meet with him.

165
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,087
Are you suggesting that--

166
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,923
It's the attorney general's word
against Heather's.

167
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,802
As your lawyer,
I can't be part of this conversation.

168
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,679
We can still win this campaign.

169
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,223
I'll be in the lobby.

170
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,901
I'll back you up.

171
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,447
The security detail
only saw me and Goodwin together,

172
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,239
not the two of you.

173
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,995
This is under oath.

174
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,457
Underwood's people are trying to smear us.

175
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,501
The whole point of this campaign
was to be the opposite of Underwood.

176
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,422
- I thought you wanted this.
- Not if it means breaking the law.

177
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,591
Do you think he'd even be
having this conversation?

178
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,803
You actually care about the law,
Heather...

179
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,848
which is why you need to be president.

180
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,746
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Bob, I didn't realize--

181
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,040
The Leader and I were just discussing
the bailout package.

182
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,167
President Blythe
just wanted me to stress

183
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,005
how important it is that the Democrats
stick together right now

184
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,548
with Francis being--

185
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,301
There's no need. I just called the Speaker
to schedule an emergency vote.

186
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,138
I'm sure the president will be pleased.

187
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,725
- How... How's Frank?
- He's hanging in there.

188
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,434
I'm sure you wanna
get back to the hospital.

189
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,104
But thank you for making
the personal visit.

190
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,065
- Thoughts and prayers, Claire.
- Thank you, Bob.

191
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,694
I'll walk you out.
Excuse me, Leader.

192
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,791
You came here to threaten me.

193
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,709
We don't need to be at odds, Jackie.

194
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,006
Do you plan on hanging this over my head
every time I try to oppose you?

195
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,300
You can't fault me for your sloppiness.

196
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,511
That's a "yes."

197
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,598
As long as we're working together,
you have nothing to worry about.

198
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,439
Mr. President,
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

199
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,527
The members of the G7 are already ruffled
because Russia was invited,

200
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,071
and Petrov may be using this opportunity
to embarrass us

201
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,073
in front of the international community.

202
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,157
Yes?

203
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,284
- <i>The First Lady is here, sir.</i>
- Send her in.

204
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,703
Sir, I would like to finish our briefing--

205
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,081
I'm not gonna keep the First Lady waiting
if she wants to see me.

206
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,794
- I'm sure you've heard.
- Yes, Birch called a few minutes ago.

207
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,130
I'd like to join you
in Brandenburg, Cathy.

208
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,633
Well, I appreciate you
wanting to pitch in,

209
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,051
but I really don't think that's necessary.

210
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,220
Well, I know this plan
better than anyone.

211
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,931
- Mr. President--
- There is only one shot at this.

212
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,183
- Everyone at the same table.
- What about Frank?

213
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,436
In Brandenburg, I can be useful.
I can't here.

214
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,648
The First Lady cannot negotiate
on behalf of the United States government.

215
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,068
The delegation is
at your discretion, Mr. President.

216
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,362
It might be good for you
to have some support.

217
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,240
Her presence undermines my authority
as Secretary of State.

218
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,995
Cathy, Petrov is incredibly stubborn.
Trust me, I know.

219
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,372
Why wouldn't you wanna have
every asset available to you?

220
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,333
- Allow me to do this, Mr. President.
- Sir--

221
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,879
- If it increases our chances.
- It will, I promise.

222
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,091
Then join us.
We're going over the briefing now.

223
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,441
You tried, Frank...

224
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,404
which is more than most people ever do.

225
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,657
Right now, it's just us.

226
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,785
Rest your eyes.

227
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,536
We have all the time in the world.

228
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,047
Danny, what was that?

229
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,260
- Danny?
- Nothing, Mom.

230
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,269
Open the door.

231
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,815
Open the door.

232
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,163
Mrs. Underwood?
Dr. Saxon is on the line.

233
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,667
Excuse me.

234
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:34,966
Hello?

235
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,304
Good evening,
or good morning.

236
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,392
President Underwood
is currently being prepped for surgery

237
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,186
to receive a liver transplant.

238
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,731
Barring any complications,

239
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,649
the surgery is expected to take
12 to 13 hours.

240
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>Uh, we'll update you
about the progress if need be,</i>

241
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,531
<i>but probably nothing more
until the operation's completed.</i>

242
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,702
We can turn the plane around
right now, ma'am.

243
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,162
You'll be back
before he's out of surgery.

244
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,249
We should do that, Claire.

245
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,167
I'll be late to the summit,
but everyone will--

246
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,294
No. We're almost there.

247
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,883
- We keep going.
- Honestly, Claire--

248
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,218
- Inform the captain to stay on course.
- Yes, ma'am.

249
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,807
Connect me with Seth Grayson, please.

250
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,066
He's already gone in.

251
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>The First Lady is currently
en route to Brandenburg</i>

252
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,446
<i>and will not be in Washington
for the surgery.</i>

253
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,004
<i>She will continue onto the G7 Summit
to assist Secretary Durant, as planned.</i>

254
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,049
She asked me to read
the following statement.

255
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,636
"It was a difficult decision
for me not to return..."

256
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,015
But I know my husband.
If he were conscious...

257
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,558
<i>"...he'd tell me to press on..."</i>

258
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,853
<i>...that the best way to be
at his side is to serve my country.</i>

259
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,647
"And I can serve it better in Germany
than in a waiting room.

260
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
<i>If there's an emergency,
I'll return immediately..."</i>

261
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,611
<i>...but I have the utmost faith...</i>

262
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,488
"...in the medical team
at Jefferson Memorial."

263
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,657
I'm praying for a successful procedure,

264
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,412
<i>and I ask all of you to join me
in praying for my husband,</i>

265
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,081
<i>your president.</i>

266
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,553
Right over there, Ms. Dunbar.

267
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,931
Will your attorneys
be joining us?

268
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,891
I've asked my attorneys not to attend.

269
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,144
We have to advise you
that it's in your best interest--

270
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,855
I'm well aware, Mr. Morgan.

271
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,191
It's not my first time at this table.

272
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,545
Thank you, President Zhou.
President Petrov?

273
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,257
Russia shares
China's desire for inclusion.

274
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,135
We are looking forward
to productive talks.

275
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,262
And we also want to extend
our sincere best wishes

276
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,597
for President Underwood's surgery.

277
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,183
He is dearly missed at this meeting.

278
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,644
Thank you, Mr. President.

279
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,023
So, shall we begin?

280
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,569
The most pressing order of business

281
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:48,367
is the joint IMF, American-Chinese
debt relief package

282
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,411
to the Russian Federation.

283
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,121
We're recording?

284
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,044
Ms. Dunbar, any statement you make
will be part of the public record

285
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,586
as part of the DOJ report.

286
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,048
Although this video is simply
for purposes of--

287
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,300
You can make the video
available to the media.

288
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,467
I have nothing to hide.

289
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,762
So you're waiving your right
to keep the video from public view?

290
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,472
I am.

291
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,641
The attorney general
says you pressured her

292
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,185
to look into Lucas Goodwin's claims--

293
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,770
I've read
the attorney general's statement.

294
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,065
We also have a deposition
from a young woman,

295
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,400
a staffer, who says Goodwin posed

296
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,195
as a volunteer at an event
in Cincinnati on March 8th.

297
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,448
Did you meet with Mr. Goodwin?

298
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,242
I shake hundreds
of people's hands at every event.

299
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,580
If he was in Cincinnati,
there's a chance I may have shaken his.

300
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,043
But the claim that he and I
met one-on-one...

301
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,340
So you're saying
you didn't meet with him?

302
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,718
We have phone records, Ms. Dunbar.
You did speak to the attorney general.

303
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,846
Martha is my former boss
and an old friend.

304
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,140
We speak frequently.
Why she would claim that I--

305
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,101
We need a simple answer,
Ms. Dunbar.

306
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:59,313
Did you or did you not meet with
Lucas Goodwin privately in Cincinnati?

307
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,947
Yes.

308
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:14,161
I met with a man I didn't know
who turned out to be unhinged.

309
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,080
I contacted the attorney general

310
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,540
because she's the top law enforcement
official in the country

311
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,503
and WITSEC is under her jurisdiction.
I did nothing wrong.

312
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,837
Tell us the nature of this meeting.

313
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,131
I'd like to say,
for the record,

314
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,966
that I think this interview
is an act of political sabotage.

315
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,762
Its goal is to make me
look guilty by association,

316
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,849
but there are the way things look
and the way things actually are.

317
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,645
When I investigated Frank Underwood,
he looked innocent, but he wasn't.

318
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,688
I couldn't prove it,
but I knew it to be true.

319
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,939
Ms. Dunbar--

320
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,317
You have proof
that I met with Mr. Goodwin.

321
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,069
I've admitted it.

322
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,821
All that proves is that I'm honest,

323
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,116
unlike a president who would
use the Department of Justice

324
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,787
to target his political opponent
for his own personal gain.

325
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,165
Let me remind you, ma'am,
the president was unconscious

326
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,916
when this investigation began--

327
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,335
It doesn't matter whether
he was unconscious or not,

328
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,504
whether he lives or dies.

329
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,923
The president is the people
who work for him.

330
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,865
I don't think
this is going to work.

331
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:19,120
Petrov's talking the talk in session,
but he won't meet with me privately.

332
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,247
Chinese are ready to sign,
if that's the hold-up.

333
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,789
It's not the Chinese.

334
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,084
He refuses to meet with anyone
other than a head of state.

335
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,587
Then see if he'll meet
with the president's wife.

336
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,717
<i>It doesn't change the fact
that he is morally corrupt,</i>

337
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,803
<i>and he has corrupted
the institutions that report to him.</i>

338
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:41,767
<i>That is why I am running for president,
because someone needs to fight this.</i>

339
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,602
<i>So not only did she meet with Goodwin,</i>

340
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,272
<i>she's using the investigation
to attack a president</i>

341
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,939
<i>who's on the operating table as we speak.</i>

342
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,775
<i>Yeah, the way
she keeps defending herself</i>

343
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,318
<i>only gives conspiracy theorists more...</i>

344
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:52,403
She's done.

345
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,737
<i>Now, I'm not saying
that she was involved...</i>

346
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,863
Without a doubt.

347
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,323
<i>...but many are
taking to social media...</i>

348
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,450
- Seth.
<i>- Hello, Cynthia.</i>

349
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,785
Think you might have anything for me?

350
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,704
<i>...and certainly not a president
whose approval rating...</i>

351
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,206
On your campaign?

352
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,124
<i>Yeah, it's ironic...</i>

353
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,835
<i>I'm gonna hang up now.
Good luck.</i>

354
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,338
<i>...but I think
she may have just tanked it.</i>

355
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,927
Mr. President...
the transplant's complete.

356
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,682
Now they're closing him up.
We'll see how he accepts the new organ.

357
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,644
Maybe we should try and get Claire
on the phone.

358
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,895
Yeah.

359
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,399
Soon. We're waiting for him now.

360
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,071
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Donald.

361
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,992
- So it's going well?
- Well, unless his body rejects the liver.

362
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,458
- Mr. President.
- Mrs. Underwood.

363
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,917
Mr. President.

364
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,129
I thought we were meeting alone.

365
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,757
As the administration's representative,

366
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,385
I need to participate
in any conversations--

367
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,097
Madam Secretary, I believe my people
were very clear, hmm?

368
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,183
Would you give us a moment,
please, Cathy?

369
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,520
Just a little while.

370
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,237
I'll be outside.

371
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,412
So... how is surgery going?

372
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,456
So far, so good.

373
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,959
Ah, you must be exhausted.
Now, sit. Sit.

374
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,381
I imagine
you'd rather be at the hospital.

375
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,090
Well, this is too important,

376
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,843
and you weren't going to negotiate
with Secretary Durant.

377
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,304
What makes you think
I'll negotiate with you?

378
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,015
Oh, well, isn't that
why we're sitting here?

379
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:50,646
Hmm. Maybe I just wanted to...
see your face again.

380
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,856
Maybe I'm fond of it.

381
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,110
You are a beautiful woman,
Mrs. Underwood, hmm?

382
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,529
Those lips...

383
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,742
Would you say something for me?

384
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,122
Would you say, um...

385
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:14,420
"Shame on you... Mr. President."

386
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,840
Really, Viktor?
Are we gonna dredge that up?

387
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,968
An apology would do...

388
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,805
if you want to negotiate...

389
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,060
Well, you would lose respect for me
if I apologized.

390
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,688
Yes.

391
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,232
Yes, this is true.

392
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,322
I'm not here
for a sightseeing trip, Viktor.

393
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:46,034
So, Francis needs a liver
and I need a bailout.

394
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,871
- What do you need?
- I need for you to agree to the terms.

395
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,584
Oh, yes, the terms.
The terms, yes.

396
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,421
But why are you here...
and not with Francis?

397
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,302
When your mother is sick,
you go to her.

398
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,220
Not your husband, hmm?

399
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,350
Were the stories true?

400
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,479
Are there problems, Claire?

401
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,774
What are your concerns with the Chinese?

402
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,531
There are too many drilling sites
in sensitive areas.

403
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,074
It's a security issue to us.

404
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,951
And what sites, in particular,
are you worried about?

405
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,787
Oh, you... you are familiar
with the individual zones?

406
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,415
It's my plan.
I know it backwards and forwards.

407
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,293
I see, so that's why
it's so important to you.

408
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,046
Because it's yours.

409
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,844
Is it one of these?

410
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,097
On the Pacific coast?

411
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,609
You asked for me, sir?

412
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,091
I wanna get out of this place
as soon as possible.

413
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,261
I'll make sure of it, sir.

414
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,432
Where's Claire?

415
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,809
She's in Germany.

416
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,061
Germany?

417
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,731
A lot to catch you up on,
Mr. President.

418
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,078
- <i>Raymond.</i>
- The Chinese are getting skittish.

419
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,831
<i>They wanna know
why it's taking so long.</i>

420
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,667
Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon,
they may back out.

421
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,212
- Thank you, Raymond.
<i>- I'm on standby.</i>

422
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,173
We need to shake hands on this.

423
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,011
No. No, I told you,
nothing on Sakhalin Island.

424
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,099
It's two zones on the southern end.
Then you have your bailout.

425
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,851
It opens a door I don't want to open.

426
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,604
They're being more than reasonable,
Mr. President.

427
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,313
Reasonable?
In whose eyes?

428
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,524
You and China are raping Siberia.

429
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,943
We didn't run your economy
into the ground.

430
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,402
You did.

431
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,073
Is this how you tried to convince
Michael Corrigan before he hung himself?

432
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,867
Because that's what
you are asking me to do,

433
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,910
to tie the noose around my own neck.

434
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,998
What's next?
The Black Sea? The Arctic?

435
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,919
I cannot allow the Chinese ships
to come this close to my sovereign--

436
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,884
Mrs. Underwood,
President Underwood is on the line.

437
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,137
- He's awake?
- Yes, ma'am.

438
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,306
Go, go.
We're done here.

439
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,607
- I can't speak with him right now.
- Mrs. Underwood--

440
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,358
I will let you know when I'm available.

441
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,443
Yes, ma'am.

442
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,823
You should talk to your husband.

443
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,451
I'm not leaving here
until we have an agreement.

444
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,287
But you're an amateur, Claire.

445
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,583
You fly in, you puff up your chest
and you pretend to play president.

446
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,210
But what would you be
without your husband?

447
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,505
Nothing.
A pretty face.

448
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,803
So, yes,
play the president if you like.

449
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:37,182
Go. Tell the Chinese
they get nothing on the Pacific.

450
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,978
You think you can do that,
Mrs. Underwood?

451
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,982
Your people are hurting.

452
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,069
Six months at most,
they're gonna be marching on Red Square.

453
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,239
I'm done letting you have your dignity.

454
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,284
The truth is you're a beggar
on your knees,

455
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,163
and you will take
whatever we shove down your throat.

456
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,464
Viktor.

457
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,556
Take the deal.
Get your dignity back.

458
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,487
Madam Secretary.

459
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,125
Joint control of zones 61 and 67.

460
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,921
We've got an agreement,
pending the president's approval.

461
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,716
Well, he's sleeping now.

462
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,136
They're moving him back
to the White House soon.

463
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,347
- And how did he seem?
<i>- I only talked to him briefly,</i>

464
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,977
<i>but the doctors say the organ is...
taking well so far.</i>

465
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,896
They're expecting a quick recovery.

466
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,151
You've done an outstanding job,
Mr. President.

467
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,571
- So have you, Claire.
- I'm going to try and get some rest.

468
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,784
<i>Of course.
Have a safe flight.</i>

469
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,210
<i>Experts were pessimistic
that anything meaningful</i>

470
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,212
<i>could come out of the summit.</i>

471
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,298
Draft of the appropriations bill
from the Speaker's office.

472
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,841
Just put it on the desk, please.

473
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,177
<i>...Catherine Durant
had this to say from Brandenburg.</i>

474
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,095
<i>President Petrov and I
worked through the night</i>

475
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,684
<i>in concert with the Chinese government
in order to come up with an agreement.</i>

476
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,519
<i>Along with partners
in the private sector,</i>

477
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,190
<i>the United States, China, and Russia
will collaborate on a plan</i>

478
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:55,445
<i>to extract oil from untapped sites
in eastern Siberia.</i>

479
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:59,615
<i>This will then enable a return
to a more stable oil market,</i>

480
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,203
<i>as well as a stable global economy.</i>

481
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,872
<i>Now, in order to make this plan viable</i>

482
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,833
<i>and mitigate any tax burden...</i>

483
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,501
<i>...to the American
and Chinese taxpayers,</i>

484
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,505
<i>the corporations will provide
the bulk of the investment,</i>

485
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,469
<i>the, uh, infrastructure
to extract the oil and the technology.</i>

486
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,429
<i>And then any of the profits</i>

487
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:26,226
<i>will then be distributed commensurately
among these corporations, as well,</i>

488
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,812
<i>and including
the land value invested</i>

489
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,897
<i>by the Russian government.</i>

490
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,399
<i>So at this time,
I'd like to open the floor</i>

491
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,818
<i>to any questions.</i>

492
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,651
I'm getting a lot of questions
about the First Lady's involvement.

493
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,362
We stick to our message
that she was just there to assist.

494
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,823
Secretary Durant led the effort.

495
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,533
There's multiple reports
that she and Petrov had a long meeting.

496
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,786
They greeted each other.
That's it.

497
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,454
So we deny?

498
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,414
The president
hasn't approved the plan yet.

499
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,167
We wanna focus on his recovery, not the--

500
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,047
- Yes?
<i>- Secretary of Health for you, sir.</i>

501
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,050
I'll find you in your office.

502
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,853
Madam Secretary.

503
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,064
- I just sent you an email.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

504
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,696
What is this?

505
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,158
<i>The father you see there?
That's who we bumped for the president.</i>

506
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:51,121
<i>He died an hour ago.
Father of two, loving husband.</i>

507
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,290
Delete it right now
from your outbox.

508
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,168
<i>I already did,
but I wanted you to see his face...</i>

509
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,046
the family he left behind.

510
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,219
Well, uh, it will probably
take a few days, but, uh, I'm--

511
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,639
My wife is up.

512
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,391
Thank you, gentlemen.

513
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,647
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Mrs. Underwood.

514
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,982
Claire.

515
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,634
Are you in a lot of pain?

516
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,137
Nothing I can't handle.

517
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,145
Meechum?

518
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,149
I spoke to his mother.

519
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,241
- Francis, don't--
- Help me up.

520
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,454
Are you sure?

521
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,790
Yes. It's good for the recovery.

522
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,043
Doctor's orders.

523
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,549
They want me on my feet
at least once a day.

524
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,142
Let's take a walk.

525
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,983
Now, let me see if I can do it.

526
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,101
I need a minute.

527
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,802
I'm going to approve your plan.

528
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,142
It's a good plan.

529
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,104
It was hard.

530
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,357
Harder than I thought it would be.

531
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,490
Stay with me.

532
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,036
It's us against them.
Always.

533
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,956
Otherwise, what's the goddamn point?

534
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,920
I can't do it, Francis.
I can't come back and be First Lady.

535
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,547
Not that.

536
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,220
Not that.

537
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,940
I said you were nothing,
in the Oval, without me.

538
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,569
It's the other way around.

539
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,410
It would have to be different.

540
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,247
I know.

541
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,501
That's what I'm saying.

542
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,011
Come on. Let's see if you can make it
to the end of the hall.

543
00:45:17,836 --> 00:45:25,887
