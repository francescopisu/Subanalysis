00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,258
[digging] [grunting]

00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,459
[exhales]

3
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,630
There are two kinds of pain.

4
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,175
The sort of pain that makes you strong.

5
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,761
Or useless pain...

6
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,014
the sort of pain that's only suffering.

7
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,810
I have no patience for useless things.

8
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,157
[sighs]

9
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,079
I turn around and see her,

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,458
my darling wife,
poised on the front stoop.

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,586
Surely she saw everything.

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,508
The killing, the lying about it,
but doesn't say a word.

13
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,012
She just enters the house
in quiet compliance.

14
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,141
This is love.

15
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,310
Everyone should be so...

16
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,606
[sighs]

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,276
[vehicle approaching in the distance]

18
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,868
[vehicle whooshes by]

19
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,504
[gasps]

20
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,691
[crowd cheering]

21
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,735
[Claire] <i>My beloved Americans.</i>

22
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,239
<i>My heart is very full today.</i>

23
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,618
<i>I am here to talk about the future.</i>

24
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>And the future has become very personal.</i>

25
00:04:55,128 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>We are gathered here at the very center
of our great nation</i>

26
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,512
<i>to celebrate this historic
Women's Conference.</i>

27
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>This is a profound moment
for all Americans.</i>

28
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,908
But it's also a perilous time

29
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,869
in our history, my friends.

30
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,956
Because the American oligarchs out there,

31
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
they are coming for us.

32
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,671
They are trying to strip me
of my constitutional power

33
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,131
as your Commander In Chief.

34
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,050
[jeering]

35
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,552
Now the lower court ruled in my favor,

36
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,804
but now they've taken this case

37
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,307
all the way to the Supreme Court.

38
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,852
And they want my finger
off the nuclear button.

39
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,188
And I have to ask...

40
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,648
Why do you think that is?

41
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,654
[jeering]

42
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,031
These oligarchs,

43
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,533
through an innocent seeming app,

44
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,578
have been trying to steal the midterms

45
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,498
by crawling your phones,

46
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,125
invading your privacy

47
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,087
and telling you how to vote.

48
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,923
Now, are you gonna
let them get away with it?

49
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,758
[audience] No!

50
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,052
We need to tell them to wake up!

51
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,970
Say it with me, Lebanon, Kansas.

52
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,014
It is time for Congress to...

53
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,432
[audience] Wake up!

54
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,227
And it's time for the Supreme Court to...

55
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,062
[audience] Wake up!

56
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,733
Now, my purpose is to elevate America,

57
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,693
<i>fight for America,</i>

58
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,280
<i>and if it ever came to it,
die for America.</i>

59
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>I will be father, mother, leader
and friend.</i>

60
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,703
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

61
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,248
[audience cheering]

62
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,917
[shuts off radio]

63
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,547
Father, mother, leader...

64
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,760
liar, killer.

65
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,949
Rest in peace, Rachel.

66
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,829
[engine starts]

67
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,491
[Claire] <i>When's the footage from?</i>

68
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,048
[Nathan] <i>It's from several days ago.</i>

69
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,969
<i>He's been staying at a cabin.
Childhood cabin for three or four weeks.</i>

70
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,972
<i>We suspect he's in the mountains
outside Los Cerillos now.</i>

71
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,640
And did he find where he buried her?

72
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>We're still not sure.</i>

73
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,227
<i>Ma'am, I got a tip from a former agent.</i>

74
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,772
One of the ones poking around Gaffney
on behalf of the Shepherds.

75
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,400
<i>Doug recently reached out to Seth Grayson.</i>

76
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,777
Do we know what was discussed?

77
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,073
<i>No, but it's the first time he's contacted
anyone connected with the Shepherds</i>

78
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,201
<i>since you last spoke to him.</i>

79
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,748
Well, if he's trying to get caught,
let's catch him.

80
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,088
So is Duncan Shepherd testifying or not?

81
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,049
His lawyers are negotiating the terms.

82
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,468
They're hoping that he could meet
behind closed doors.

83
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,803
Well, then he needs to be subpoenaed.

84
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,323
Every congressperson we've spoken to

85
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,408
- agrees he should be and yet...
- [woman] They're delaying.

86
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,393
I mean, there's no real desire
to move this app investigation along.

87
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
They're protecting their own.

88
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,689
The House asked for these hearings.

89
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,816
The theatre is good for them.

90
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,527
But we are in constant contact

91
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,650
with the Democratic members
of the committee, ma'am.

92
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,855
They're feeling the pressure.

93
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,824
Well, clearly, not enough.
We can start arresting congresspeople.

94
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,628
Pull them out of the chambers
if we have to.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,913
- The whole point of the hearings...
- Is what? Obfuscation?

96
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,542
What? We're talking about invasion
of privacy here.

97
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,461
The US Attorney is resistant
to pressing any kind of charges

98
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,297
- without hard evidence.
- The app is the evidence.

99
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,676
- This is grounds for prosecution, Nora.
<i>- </i>Yes, maybe.

100
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,720
- But the US Attorney would argue...
- Replace the US Attorney.

101
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,474
She's been dragging her feet
on this for months.

102
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,603
Ma'am, we still live in a world
of due process.

103
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,247
- That would send a chilling message...
<i>- </i>The message is we need to protect our democracy.

104
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,536
On a practical note,
we're canceling the fourth stop today.

105
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,541
Upon reflection, we decided Toledo
would be redundant with Cleveland.

106
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
Pam, it's fine. You can be honest.

107
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,715
The Commander In Chief is feeling
a little woozy today. That's all.

108
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,469
And yes, maybe a little cranky,
but nothing serious. I promise.

109
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,349
[sighs] When we touch down in Des Moines,

110
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,311
Nora, you can head straight back to DC.

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,826
Is it Slavic, "Skorsky"?

112
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,872
Polish, in my case.

113
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,207
You must be lonely.

114
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,005
I asked the press corps
to take the second plane,

115
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,716
so that you and I could meet privately.

116
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,720
Four months ago, you met with two people.

117
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,017
One of them's missing
and one of them is dead.

118
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,813
My life has certainly been punctuated
with loss lately.

119
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,733
And just a bit of great luck.

120
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,235
Tom Hammerschmidt was not lucky.

121
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,821
No, he wasn't. That was tragic.

122
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,659
That's why I think
you should pick up his mantle.

123
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,245
And tell the full story
of Francis' political career.

124
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,997
Are you messing with me?

125
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
No. Far from it.

126
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,293
You did a great job investigating
and exposing

127
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,587
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app.

128
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,131
Its nefarious uses.

129
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,260
We can't let congresspeople get away
with things like that.

130
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,847
I wonder if you'll get them in line

131
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,684
before the Supreme Court
takes your power away.

132
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,355
Tom Hammerschmidt and I,
the last time we spoke,

133
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,564
we talked about my husband.

134
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,859
And my hope is
I could pick it up with you.

135
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,899
I have a lot that needs to be said about
Francis, his crimes and misdemeanors.

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,285
You want my story or don't you?

137
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,871
[Claire] Oh.

138
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,376
Oh, it's these mini contractions.

139
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,463
They're, um... called Braxton Hicks.

140
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,798
Do you have kids?

141
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,050
- No, I don't.
- [gasps]

142
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,846
Oh, the baby's really moving now.

143
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,348
It's kicking. Do you want to feel?

144
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,267
No, thank you.

145
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,644
Such a strange feeling.

146
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,187
[sighs]

147
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,234
To be wholly responsible
for the life of another.

148
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,864
Also, I hear,
when you have kids, you never...

149
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,742
sleep quite the same again.

150
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,329
There are two kinds of pain.

151
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,295
Doug Stamper sent me that text,

152
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,591
he said it comes
from your husband's diary.

153
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,596
Now, I ask you,

154
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,726
who should I interview, you or him?

155
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,748
[Bill] I know that some of you are here

156
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,817
because you're not sure I'm gonna be
around at next year's gathering.

157
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,611
Oh, no, no, I can see it on...

158
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,614
On your faces. And it's true.

159
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,410
These last few months,
I've had to look back.

160
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,956
But I'm excited. I am.

161
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,959
As my sister told you,

162
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,172
there are changes coming to this country
in the next few months.

163
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,759
The kind that I haven't been able
to accomplish

164
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,303
in the 20 plus years
that I've been at it.

165
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,183
It'll cut regulation for the people,
give every man a chance.

166
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,519
You lead a man to fish, and he...

167
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,398
You want to lock me up in prison
for that, then so be it, but... [scoffs]

168
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,568
Seize my assets. Hmm.

169
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,698
Did you read...

170
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,580
finches dream?

171
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,460
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,712
They can... They have the...

173
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,299
They can sing to themselves
when they sleep.

174
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,885
[Bill] Where was I?

175
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,054
I have congressmen who want to break away.

176
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,723
Separate themselves from this.

177
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,143
Well, deflect and compliment.

178
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,979
That's how I survived the Hill.

179
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,107
[Bill] ...republic, army of clerks...

180
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,402
These hearings will blow up on us, Mark.

181
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,489
Now, one way or another,
we all used that motherfucking app.

182
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
And yes, they've been good to us, but...

183
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,581
why do we all have to pay
for what the son set in motion?

184
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,334
Anything you want to say about Duncan,
you say it to Annette.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,961
Well, I'm asking you to say it.

186
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,171
[scoffs]

187
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,052
I can't believe I'm looking to you
for help again all these years later.

188
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,017
You were vice president. [scoffs]

189
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,647
I've rebuilt my career
at least three times, Brett.

190
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,526
And I will continue to do so
as long as I have to.

191
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,239
Too bad Jane Davis won't have that chance.

192
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,911
"What I am to Claire
is not what I am to Zoe."

193
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,079
Do you know what it means?

194
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,874
Does he believe you should know
what it means?

195
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,003
Yes. He added,
"And that's what he left me..."

196
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,173
It belongs to some diary
that Francis kept.

197
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,106
But not part of his presidential papers?

198
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,178
Whatever it is, it's information
that President Underwood...

199
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,473
President Hale wants kept out
of the light.

200
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,060
Doug implied that she got pregnant

201
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,604
so as to keep him
from what was rightfully his.

202
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,665
When will you speak with him next?

203
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,692
My guess is the next time
he finds a payphone or a burner.

204
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,861
I'd like to meet with him.

205
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,831
- Annette.
- You're going to be famous, Brett.

206
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,333
Well, there's fame...

207
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,461
and then there's notoriety.

208
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,214
The bill you had your name on
all those months ago...

209
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,716
will be upheld in the Supreme Court.

210
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,011
This is Judge Abruzzo's majority ruling.

211
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,933
- How did you...
- We helped him write it.

212
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,063
It's worded in such a way
that her powers will be diminished...

213
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,108
over time and across the board.

214
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,861
Mark gave you a sense
of what we're thinking?

215
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,945
A bit.

216
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,843
[Annette] You just need to run out
the clock on these hearings.

217
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,868
After the midterms,
you can send a powerful message.

218
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:43,127
Over the years, we've been lucky enough
to support an array of talented

219
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
and like-minded politicians.

220
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,548
We've essentially operated
like a third party.

221
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,883
And one day,

222
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,095
in the not too distant future,
we'll make it official.

223
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,015
Brett, you will be the leader
of that party.

224
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,976
You'll be our man in the White House.

225
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,104
I told Brett how thankful we are

226
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,065
for keeping Duncan out of the spotlight.

227
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,110
I won't forget all you've done for him.

228
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,897
[Bill] <i>Well, that's actually</i>
<i>a very good question, Bob.</i>

229
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,616
Where do we rank
as a country in the world?

230
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,952
You have to ask that. We're 17.

231
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,997
That's where we are. 17th.

232
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,916
- That is a disgrace...
- Speaking of disgrace,

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,044
I have a question for you, sir.

234
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,212
Did your family make you sick

235
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,049
with their chemical plants
and their toxic sites?

236
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,383
Get her out of here.

237
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,135
You made yourself sick.

238
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,031
- And you're killing all of us.
- Somebody take care of this young lady.

239
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,016
Of course he's going to take me out.
You're killing all of us.

240
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,272
[Doug]
<i>"I'm not gonna lie, I despise children.</i>

241
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,024
<i>There, I've said it."</i>

242
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,609
What the hell is wrong with you?

243
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,944
"Thirty minutes ago I received a text
from Zoe.

244
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,114
- She intends to apologize, no doubt."
- Wait, wait, what's that from?

245
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,449
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

246
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,994
Doug, come here. Let's meet.

247
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>"Rebellion on all fronts..."</i>

248
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,416
"Claire, Zoe, Russo.
I must not lose my resolve."

249
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,293
Hey, stop. Where are you?

250
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,797
<i>No, no, no.
That's not how this is gonna work.</i>

251
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,301
Doug, we can find you.

252
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,594
<i>It won't take very long.</i>

253
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,304
I'll tell you where I am right now.

254
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,848
Right in the middle of nowhere.

255
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,505
I'm five minutes from out of here
and out of fucking mind.

256
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,937
She just wants to sit with you.

257
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,815
I'm going to tell you what I want said
and how.

258
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,694
They have the lawyers, the money.
I don't.

259
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,363
<i>They do what I tell them,</i>

260
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,740
<i>then I know we can meet.</i>

261
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,702
You will get everything that you are due.
I'll make sure of it.

262
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,124
When will I hear from you again?

263
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm so sorry that they called you
onto the plane, Dr. Larson.

264
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,641
I feel fine now.

265
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,726
All the same,
you're getting close to a time

266
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,563
where jumping on and off a plane
may not be the best idea.

267
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,690
You said you'd been feeling run down.

268
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,109
- Yes, a little bit. But...
- I think we should get

269
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,903
you back to DC to do some blood work
as a precaution.

270
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,530
Okay, that's fine.

271
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,075
But unless I'm putting the baby in danger,

272
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,995
I've got two more appearances today.

273
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,705
I'd advise against that.

274
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,289
[sighs]

275
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,543
I cannot be the indisposed president,
Dr. Larson.

276
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
I'm sure you're fine,

277
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,921
but your sample tells me
you're a bit dehydrated.

278
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,257
At least let me get you on an IV.

279
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,633
It won't take long.

280
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,927
We'll get your fluids back to normal.

281
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,598
Is this really necessary?

282
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,266
He's a grown man.

283
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,269
If you'd rather have Seth bring me
the signed documents that's fine, too.

284
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,395
Annie, you have to admit

285
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,732
- this is the most cockamamie thing...
- That's Dad's word.

286
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,109
And please don't confuse me with someone

287
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,404
who's willing to listen to one more
of your goddamn opinions.

288
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,948
Each of us will legally adopt him.

289
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,409
And when we're dead and gone,
it will be Duncan...

290
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,748
who is the face, voice and embodiment
of Shepherd Unlimited.

291
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,419
I'm doing this for you.

292
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,296
- I'm late.
- I'm signing.

293
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,639
Is it your plan to keep avoiding me?

294
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,392
- Bill.
- Lordy, what exactly is it I did to you?

295
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,394
You think you know what's best for me.

296
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,230
I am not our father.

297
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,565
Would have been swell
if you'd realized that sooner.

298
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,489
So glad you got to spend some time
with your friends like this, Bill.

299
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,038
I can't get that woman out of my head.

300
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,667
Do you think she was right?

301
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,337
Did we poison ourselves?

302
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,262
[door opens]

303
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,515
[Walter] Is Abruzzo impeachable? Yes.

304
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,309
Would the Senate convict him?

305
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,270
Who knows?

306
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,272
But what does it matter?

307
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,984
You need him scared, and this might do it.

308
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,903
He received an interest-free loan

309
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,824
from a Shepherd-owned entity
for a lake house at the same time

310
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,828
that he was ruling on a case that involved
another part of that company.

311
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,539
Is everything all right?

312
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,003
Yes. Sorry.
I'm just a little bit dehydrated.

313
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,590
Why hasn't this ever come up before,
Walter?

314
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,093
Abruzzo was never fully-vetted.

315
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,429
By you, by anybody.

316
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,557
In a way, the fact that
he was railroaded through

317
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,184
[laughs] has proved
to be your opportunity.

318
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,687
And the rest of the court?

319
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,355
Locked in.

320
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,442
Abruzzo's the swing vote.

321
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,070
We at the Shepherd Freedom Foundation,

322
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,323
freedom being the operative word there,

323
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,033
believe in the individual.

324
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,661
I could argue that our foundation is

325
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,248
more inclusive, more forward-looking

326
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,126
than any so-called progressive agenda.

327
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,628
- [clamoring]
- Oh, listen.

328
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,634
Listen to you. You are so programmed
that you can't hear my argument.

329
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,431
Nathan. I wish I could help you.

330
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,477
Withholding information from
an ongoing investigation is a crime.

331
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,355
If you know anything
about his whereabouts,

332
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,439
suggest you tell me.

333
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,242
What are you gonna do
when all this is over?

334
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,318
I mean, think about it.

335
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,488
How long before you become the one
with too many secrets?

336
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,823
Our president scares me.

337
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,535
If anyone knows
what she's been up to, it's you.

338
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,329
You have children, right?

339
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,081
How many wives?

340
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,874
Leave them out of it.

341
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
Can you?

342
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,712
My father was a cop.

343
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,714
My mom's a widow.

344
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,259
It's a hard life, Nathan.

345
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,930
All those years at the Bureau.

346
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,016
The time you put in,
all that experience, it's valuable.

347
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,352
- Where's Doug?
- [sighs]

348
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,230
The thing about these events,

349
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,107
there's cameras everywhere.

350
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,190
Seth.

351
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,403
No, because this is where
I turn to the camera.

352
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,780
And I say,

353
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,448
I don't know.

354
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,871
<i>I'm sad to say, but there is
a Russian troll factory</i>

355
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>that has begun to manipulate
your husband's accomplishments.</i>

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,043
That's awful.

357
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,588
<i>No. We caught them. But for instance,</i>

358
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>records of his years at Harvard,</i>
<i>his years at the </i>Sentinel,

359
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,638
<i>are virtually impossible to track down.</i>

360
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,392
<i>Now, instead you find fabrications
about him.</i>

361
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,353
<i>They filled the air with noise,
so to speak.</i>

362
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,482
<i>I know from last we spoke,
you were concerned</i>

363
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,401
<i>something like this could happen.</i>

364
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,153
Well, I was.

365
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,596
That someone had mentioned the possibility
to me. But I had no idea it could be done.

366
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,576
<i>We have unfortunately entered an era</i>

367
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,788
<i>where our digital truths are vulnerable.</i>

368
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,248
In that case,

369
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,294
couldn't these trolls amplify
my husband's crimes as well?

370
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,545
<i>Yes.</i>

371
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,508
<i>And those would be
very difficult stories to take back.</i>

372
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,428
Viktor, that would be terrible
if that were to happen.

373
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,766
<i>History belongs to the highest bidder now.</i>

374
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,479
Well, I hope his reputation
can survive his crimes.

375
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,315
And I hope... [winces]

376
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now.

377
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,239
<i>Claire, something wrong?</i>

378
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,217
- [woman] <i>How's she doing?</i>
- [man] <i>She's tachycardiac</i>

379
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,577
<i>with elevated respirations,
Q5 contractions.</i>

380
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,455
You're 26 weeks pregnant, Madam President.

381
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,538
[monitors beeping]

382
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,292
We need to give her four grams of mag.
Start the drip.

383
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,045
[Claire gasping]

384
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,005
[man, muffled and echoing]
<i>Francis Underwood?</i>

385
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,508
[monitors beeping rapidly,
nurses agitated]

386
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,426
[man] <i>Francis Underwood.</i>

387
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,178
[gasps]

388
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,431
[man] <i>Francis Underwood?</i>

389
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,809
Why do you say his name like that?

390
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,103
Why would you get engaged?

391
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,855
I'm not engaged.

392
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,943
- Gretchen said...
- Gretchen should mind her own business.

393
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,493
[man sighs]

394
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,205
I haven't answered him yet.

395
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,499
The sex can't be great with him,

396
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,417
it just can't.

397
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,128
The sex is great with you.

398
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,177
I thought we were gonna
fuck our way across Europe

399
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,722
and China and Africa or wherever.

400
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,475
Hmm. Who says we won't?

401
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,565
- Francis fucking Underwood.
- Reed. Would you stop?

402
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,358
I mean, come on. The guy's not your type.

403
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,068
Oh, because you are?

404
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,199
I'm your parents' type.
But I wouldn't be if they really knew me.

405
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,119
Which I guess is another way
of saying yes.

406
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,204
- I am your type.
- Hmm.

407
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,708
Francis is the patron saint of animals.

408
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,296
He never stops talking. Every time
I see that guy, his mouth is running.

409
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,425
Because he always has an audience
and you never know what he's going to say.

410
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,263
Claire Hale.

411
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,017
What do you want?

412
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,816
What?

413
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,408
I want...

414
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,871
every door to be wide open

415
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,251
and stay that way.

416
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,632
Then call him...

417
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,385
and tell him it's over,
because you're coming with me.

418
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,055
I am?

419
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,332
Hi, Francis, it's me.

420
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,669
I'm five minutes away.

421
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,138
[man] <i>Someone will have to get</i>
<i>to the bottom of it, Madam President.</i>

422
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,597
I mean...

423
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,142
Pitocin induces labor.

424
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,686
She'll never practice again.

425
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,232
Is the baby gonna be okay?

426
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,526
The baby is fine.

427
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,654
Here we go.

428
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,699
[heart beating]

429
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,284
Would you like to know the sex?

430
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,497
[cell phone rings]

431
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,000
Hello.

432
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,170
[beating]

433
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,801
[beating continuing]

434
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,265
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.

435
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,477
[beep]

436
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,656
[gasping]

437
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,173
I'm coming for you, Claire. [exhaling]

438
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,992
I'm not gonna run, Nathan.

439
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,760
35 degrees, 28 minutes,
22 seconds north,

440
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,389
by a 106 degrees,
8 minutes, 58 seconds west.

441
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,767
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,397
It's where Rachel Posner is buried.

443
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,694
Let me ask you something, Nathan.

444
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,822
After all this time.

445
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,742
All these years together.
Everything that we did for Frank.

446
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,703
Stuff with Lucas,

447
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,121
Macallan,

448
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,331
the terrorist kid.

449
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,045
Everything we ever did. Are you seriously
telling me, you're gonna choose her?

450
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,802
Literally, all I care about
is getting out of this alive.

451
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,599
Get in.

452
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,110
How is it possible
we still haven't found him?

453
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,112
<i>Last time anybody saw him,</i>

454
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,031
he was in New Mexico
near a border checkpoint.

455
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,908
<i>You honestly believe he's out
of the country?</i>

456
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,620
<i>It just doesn't fit, Nathan.
It's not like him to leave.</i>

457
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,539
When's the last time he had contact
with the Shepherds?

458
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,041
<i>I gather he did convey</i>

459
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,293
a few more curious quotes to Mr. Grayson.

460
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,211
But at this point, the feeling is

461
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,797
<i>they're like the ravings
of a crazy person.</i>

462
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,551
- We'll speak later.
- [hangs up telephone]

463
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,598
How did he get...

464
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,229
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.

465
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,441
I will not reap...

466
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,277
what your father has sown.

467
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,549
[grunts, panting]

468
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,902
Is everything all right, Madam President?

469
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,182
Yes.

470
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,684
I was just looking for something.

471
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,106
[Lynn] Ma'am, Congressman Cole's here.

472
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,150
Shall I send him in?

473
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,942
[Claire] Yes.

474
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,990
- Madam President.
- Brett.

475
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,787
I wonder if you would do me a favor.

476
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,413
The George Washington painting.

477
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,249
Would you mind hanging that back up
over the mantle?

478
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,418
No.

479
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,848
[Brett sighs]

480
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,687
Thank you so much and thank you
for coming. Please have a seat.

481
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:14,278
Now, the Shepherds started
backing you when?

482
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,700
Was that during or after your tragic
affair with the poor young woman?

483
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,916
My wife knows about the affair.

484
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,978
- There was no way I could have predicted...
- Don't worry.

485
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,214
I wasn't planning on using that
nasty little piece of business.

486
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,551
I just wanted to gauge
how long this was going to take.

487
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,054
So, putting the Senate aside,

488
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,224
how many members of the House
were using that app?

489
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,060
Ballpark figure is fine.

490
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,938
That's what our judiciary hearings
are trying to determine.

491
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,275
I'll go straight to arrests if I have to.

492
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,194
This is treason, Brett.

493
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,780
Somebody will go down for it.

494
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,325
So, I guess the real question is will you?

495
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,827
[Brett sighs]

496
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,705
Because I know the chair in this room
that you're gunning for

497
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,374
is not the one your ass
is currently warming.

498
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,920
Forgive me.

499
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,965
I think pregnancy
has brought out the sailor in me.

500
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,259
So.

501
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,138
What you're going to say to the press
as soon as this meeting is over.

502
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,099
You're going to say
that you asked to meet with me

503
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,519
so that you could report
some good old-fashioned quid pro quo

504
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,313
that came to your attention.

505
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:35,276
That my recent Supreme Court appointee

506
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,904
was found trading

507
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,073
a favorable ruling for a lake house.

508
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,325
Shocking.

509
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,327
And that you and I both knew

510
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,289
that the only choice you then had
was to go to congress and initiate...

511
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,499
No Supreme Court justice
has ever been impeached.

512
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,004
The good Justice Abruzzo wouldn't want
to be the first then, would he?

513
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,173
Justice Abruzzo...

514
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,467
is black.

515
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,552
Which makes this all the more...

516
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,679
There's that word again,

517
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,473
tragic.

518
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,945
Madam President.

519
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:23,950
Before you explain to me how we shouldn't
be meeting or how Brett shouldn't be here,

520
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,868
separation of branches and all that.

521
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,121
We are considering a case
that will directly affect

522
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,831
the office of the presidency.

523
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:36,712
I know, a case based on the monumental
piece of legislation co-signed by Brett.

524
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,759
But the three of us standing here
right now have nothing to do with that.

525
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,679
Isn't that right, Congressman?

526
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,431
Yes, Madam President.

527
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,434
I'll let the speaker explain.

528
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,104
'Cause you have a number of options
to consider.

529
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,357
And I want you to know how
truly embarrassing it is for me.

530
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,651
The sad fate of my choice for the court.

531
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:06,701
And by the way, I love Lake Champlain.

532
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,622
I've only been there twice,
but I'll never forget the thrilling shock

533
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,457
of the cold water on my feet.

534
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,837
My grandson has MS. He needs to swim.

535
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,757
Oh. I don't judge, Justice Abruzzo.

536
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,511
I'll correct that. Except for mendacity.

537
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,931
That I can't support.

538
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,894
And, Brett, when you report this back
to the Shepherds,

539
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,064
give them my best.

540
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,615
As a Shepherd, it's your duty
to give back to the arts

541
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
and the communities you're involved in.

542
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,413
You know, everything we've ever done
at Gardner Analytics is to serve the user.

543
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,248
You've made that clear, yes.

544
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,932
And yet, you were aware of the amount of data
the user was essentially signing over to you.

545
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,379
<i>No more than any other application.</i>

546
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,191
<i>But the White House is saying
that the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app</i>

547
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,884
<i>went beyond any other application.</i>

548
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,967
<i>That it allowed congressional campaigns
complete access to the user's phone.</i>

549
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,766
Some are even saying that the app
is essentially mining peoples' psyches.

550
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,602
[laughs] Look.

551
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,729
<i>You design the thing,
but at the end of the day,</i>

552
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,023
<i>you have no idea how it will be used.</i>

553
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,106
Mr. Shepherd.

554
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,111
Could you excuse me
for one moment, please?

555
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,866
I'm Agent Slater with the FBI.

556
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,531
[Duncan] What's this about?

557
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,661
Please come with us.

558
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,598
[Duncan] I'm not going anywhere
until I call my lawyer.

559
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,165
Mr. Shepherd, please.

560
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,167
It'd be best if you cooperated.

561
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,717
Abruzzo is recusing himself.

562
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,219
[Annette] On what grounds?

563
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,346
His conflict of interest.

564
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,808
This is about the future
of the presidency.

565
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,893
He's using his military service.

566
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,437
Get him over here.

567
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,732
It's too late, he can't reverse himself.

568
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,903
I decide when it's too late.
I will not have that ruling upheld.

569
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,364
Who else can we get to?

570
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,158
[line rings, beep]

571
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,159
Barry.

572
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,495
[Barry] <i>Annette, do not turn on the TV.</i>

573
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,539
What are you talking about?

574
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,417
<i>They took him.
They came in with a warrant.</i>

575
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,585
What do you mean they took him?

576
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,089
<i>They're using his work with the app
as grounds to charge him with treason.</i>

577
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,508
<i>I promise you,
we will do everything we can.</i>

578
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,719
<i>But anyone connected with the app
is distancing themselves from it</i>

579
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,971
<i>and you.</i>

580
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,639
[beep]

581
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,687
It's finally here.

582
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,554
Where did these changes come from?

583
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,531
Directly from the Shepherd family.

584
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,450
His mother?

585
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,910
Look, just do your thing.
Let's get it on tape.

586
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,083
[scoffs]

587
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,169
Nazi-like tactics?

588
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,381
You bring up Nazis in any situation
other than the Second World War,

589
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,133
you've already lost the argument.

590
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,844
I mean, come on, we all knew
what Duncan was doing.

591
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,637
Is anybody really surprised?

592
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,181
- I mean, really?
- Melody...

593
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,481
[man] What?

594
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,942
- What are you...
- No.

595
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,696
She's polling in the high 70s.

596
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,699
We're looking at close to 80
by the midterms.

597
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,701
The anti-corporate rant

598
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,994
is gaining traction.

599
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,163
She's weaponized her feminism,

600
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,582
and it's grown tiresome.

601
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,293
"I'm a mother, I'm a general."

602
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,878
Spare me.

603
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,881
Anyone that popular is bad for democracy.

604
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:50,965
Mark.

605
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,427
So, the pros.

606
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,681
After her death,
with the vice presidency vacant,

607
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,768
our friend Brett Cole will be president.

608
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,440
We suspect we'll get a call for stability
and unity.

609
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,236
Heal the nation, we all know the drill.

610
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,489
The cons. We're gonna
take a hit in the midterms.

611
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,366
I think we hold on to the House.

612
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,284
The Senate is a long shot.

613
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,038
The markets will fluctuate for a while.

614
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,165
I've brought Lorraine in for that.

615
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,293
She's got some impressive
computer models and projections. But...

616
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,171
all in all, we're confident we can absorb

617
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,133
whatever financial hit an assassination
would have on the economy.

618
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,678
We're talking about a quarter point loss

619
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,721
in the GDP, at the most.

620
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,016
And what about all the conspiracy nonsense
we'll be hearing?

621
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,103
The theories are a useful distraction.

622
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,649
And eventually, they consume themselves.
History will back us up on that.

623
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,651
There's one hiccup. It's a big one.

624
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,862
She's with child.

625
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:59,243
That is a variable we don't know how
to account for in our models or predict.

626
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,246
We use it. Play into it.

627
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,582
We'll make her a martyr.

628
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,084
A victim of the times.

629
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,752
A feminist icon.

630
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,299
God, she might even end up on a coin.

631
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,677
As long as another Zapruder
doesn't show up.

632
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,429
Jack, that's not funny.

633
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,391
Well, that's as much as I want to know.

634
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,978
Yes, I think it's best
if you all leave now.

635
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,938
I'll take it from here.

636
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,783
Bring him in.

637
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,083
It's 11 o'clock, as they say.

638
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,546
You want what I have.

639
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,884
Actually, I want you to hold on to it.

640
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,846
I told Seth, and I'll tell you again.

641
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,892
I want to bring her down, but not Francis.

642
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,603
Don't you know that's impossible?

643
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,563
Even if she killed her husband?

644
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:52,898
Doug...

645
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,694
my goal and yours have become the same.

646
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,948
Does she call you Doug?

647
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,368
Or does she do that Francis thing of hers.

648
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,204
Douglas.

649
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,415
You know what we need to do.

650
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,959
You keep mistaking me for someone I'm not.

651
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,170
I don't care about you or what you want.

652
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,922
But you do care what Frank wanted.

653
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:21,468
And it's time you admitted it.
Frank wanted her dead.

654
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,930
This seems too personal for you.

655
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:29,393
All politics is personal.
You of all people know that.

656
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,312
And you want her dead, too.

657
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,733
And neither one of us can do it alone.

658
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,738
[mutters]

659
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,580
You'll come to your senses soon.

660
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,332
You're no fool.

661
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,419
You want to protect what he left you?

662
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,296
It's the only way.

663
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,646
Congratulations on the ruling coming out
of the court.

664
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,440
They still haven't decided.

665
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,650
But we all know how it's going to go.

666
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,070
Please, sit down.

667
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,572
[sighs]

668
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,742
Nora Cafferty...

669
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,161
has a secret.

670
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,247
Excuse me.

671
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,626
I assume you were worried
about the scare with the baby.

672
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,754
I spoke to President Petrov.

673
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:43,091
He's informed me that ICO
is trying to acquire a nuclear device.

674
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,637
Yes. They are.

675
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,263
So why didn't you tell me?

676
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,562
I have full confidence in you, Nora,
and your abilities, but this concerns me.

677
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,566
You cannot under any circumstances

678
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,445
withhold information that is essential
to our national security.

679
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,491
I had such high hopes for you.

680
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,993
I'm sorry.

681
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,332
I didn't want to have to say this.

682
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,336
I was hoping the Supreme Court
would rule against you.

683
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,713
That they would take away the football.

684
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,842
And I'm not the only one
who's starting to feel it.

685
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,683
This is my house, and I want you out.

686
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,912
She's ready to condemn her husband.

687
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,332
So why aren't you?

688
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,884
It wasn't a thief who killed Tom.

689
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,682
No.

690
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,310
- I don't think it was.
- Look,

691
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,022
- Tom and I were working on...
- Okay, I know what he was working on.

692
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,528
It took me almost a month to find it,
but it was on his dog's collar.

693
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,865
It was the same thing
Lucas was working on and Zoe before that.

694
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,451
Always with the same problem,

695
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,578
no one will believe it.

696
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,665
- Look, I laid it out for him...
- Without any evidence. [scoffs]

697
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,169
Or do you have any?

698
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,345
All there is, is your word. And what
is that even worth these days?

699
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,767
I mean, what the hell are you protecting?

700
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,770
[sighs]

701
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,653
I can keep driving. I don't mind.

702
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,701
Or you can help me finish the story
of Tom, Lucas, Zoe, you

703
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,827
and...

704
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,789
maybe me.

705
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,258
I tested you. And you passed.

706
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,053
That's basically how I see it,
Madam President.

707
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,181
You're impertinent.
That was clear from the start.

708
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,766
No, I'm ambitious.

709
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,728
Which is something that I've always
admired, from afar, about you.

710
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,482
[laughs]
Even when you were attacking me?

711
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,819
Forgive me.
I become aggressive when I'm nervous.

712
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,195
It's always been that way.

713
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,364
Can we start over?

714
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,616
Because I think I finally understand you

715
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,535
and what you're trying to do
for this country.

716
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,787
I can help you get your message out.

717
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,039
Sure.

718
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,083
[clears throat]

719
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,269
- [man] All right, settle, people.
- Okay, let's begin.

720
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,296
Let's go in four, three, two...

721
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,632
First things first.

722
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,719
Despite what the odds-makers have decided,

723
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,055
I am going to be the mother
of a baby girl.

724
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,017
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

725
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,435
And have you picked out a name?

726
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,353
Um, not yet.

727
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,190
I need to see her face first. [chuckles]

728
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:33,196
What do you most wish
the American people knew about you?

729
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,241
Something surprising.

730
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,704
That I like nothing more than to laugh.

731
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,249
And what does the prospect
of becoming a mother,

732
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:48,045
while being the leader of the free world,
feel like?

733
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,921
Bittersweet.

734
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,593
I didn't expect to deliver Francis' child
as a widow, of course.

735
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,680
But I have things to do

736
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,059
for my unborn child,
for this unformed nation.

737
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:06,980
I want to create
a progressive and productive Hale legacy

738
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,273
for the ages.

739
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,775
Speaking of which.

740
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,943
Why did you return to your maiden name?

741
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,987
Well, I think your question
answered itself.

742
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,322
Maiden name.

743
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,742
The assumptions behind that expression

744
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,662
led me back to what I can only call
my name.

745
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,582
President Hale,

746
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,001
why the delay

747
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,338
in nominating a replacement
for the vice presidential vacancy?

748
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,382
Two reasons. One, constitutionally,

749
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,384
Congress needs to confirm the choice

750
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,347
<i>and our current Congress is dirty.</i>

751
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,017
<i>We'll have to see what happens
with the midterms.</i>

752
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,435
<i>And two,</i>

753
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,688
<i>if I've learned anything
from partnerships,</i>

754
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,149
<i>you have to choose someone</i>

755
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,276
<i>who'd take a bullet for you.</i>

756
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,072
<i>And, Melody, I'd like
to come clean on something.</i>

757
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,156
[Cruz] <i>Please.</i>

758
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,202
<i>The truth is, and it pains me to say this,</i>

759
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,204
<i>but the truth is, this country</i>

760
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,207
<i>never got to know
the real Francis Underwood.</i>

761
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,168
<i>I'm not sure I ever
really knew him myself.</i>

762
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,422
<i>I know you saw it, too.</i>

763
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,135
<i>He was impossible to know,
like all con men.</i>

764
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,971
<i>He played us all.</i>

765
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,432
<i>Come and get me, Doug.</i>

766
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,377
[winces]

767
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,090
[sighs]

768
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,232
She leaves me no choice.

769

770
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,550
