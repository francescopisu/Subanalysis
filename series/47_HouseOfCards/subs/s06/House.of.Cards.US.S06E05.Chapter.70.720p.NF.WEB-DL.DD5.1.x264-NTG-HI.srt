1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,422
[lighter clicks]

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,802
[door opens, closes]

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,096
[exhales]

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,809
[girl] Hey!

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,646
- Good day, Calonice.
- Claire, what are you doing?

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,564
Thinking.

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,524
You're supposed to be on-stage right now.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,986
"Calonice, it's more than I can bear.

9
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,947
I am hot all over
with blushes for our sex.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,242
- Men say we're slippery rogues..."
- "And aren't they right?"

11
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,244
Come on, let's go.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,914
[Claire inhales and exhales]

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,124
Come on.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
We're all gonna die one day.

15
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,795
What?

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,506
I'm gonna be dead,

17
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,759
you're gonna be dead.

18
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,218
They're all gonna be dead.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,553
Everybody.

20
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,805
What the fuck are you talking about?

21
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,602
Are those my earrings?

22
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:05,356
I... didn't think you'd care.

23
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,402
You do it.

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,113
You be Lysistrata.
You know all my lines, right?

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,531
You can't just...

26
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,367
[blubbers]

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,497
What about the show? Claire!

28
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,460
We are almost good.
We just have to adjust the lights.

29
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,586
That's fine.

30
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,839
I did want to thank you personally
for doing this.

31
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,424
I really appreciate it.

32
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,603
Wait till we're finished
before you do that.

33
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,554
[laughs]
Well, I won't deviate from the questions.

34
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,974
You can ask me anything,
as long as it's about the...

35
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,267
the president.

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,270
Can you get away from me with that? -[man] My apologies.
- [Bill] I'm fine.

37
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,000
Sorry, Mr. Shepherd. It's just
that the lights are pretty harsh.

38
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,401
It's fine. Let's go.

39
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,405
This Russia debacle,

40
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,367
it's essentially a 20% tax

41
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,371
on American companies that are just
over there trying to help out the region.

42
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,208
It's the latest in a series of...

43
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,462
disastrous steps taken
by this White House.

44
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,631
And you wonder...

45
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,259
You wonder why Congress
was looking at legislation

46
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,902
to take the nuclear button away from her.
[scoffs] As a patriot,

47
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,476
as an American who loves his country
and, yes, his company,

48
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,853
we can do better.

49
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,273
We can do so much better.

50
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:38,319
Even Bill Shepherd, who the last time
he was interviewed on air was never...

51
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,113
Even he felt compelled to speak out.

52
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,157
She's the head of my party,
and I have to say, I'm at a loss.

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,911
- Her entire schedule is empty.
- Presidents have gone missing before...

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,555
But there's a difference between
clearing your head at Camp David

55
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,582
and going full-blown Howard Hughes.

56
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,170
She hasn't been seen publicly
in three weeks or heard from.

57
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,007
Except for a late night pardon
for her husband's chief of staff.

58
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,011
- Which many consider a strategic mistake.
- Well, Doug Stamper has issues.

59
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,263
Everyone in her administration has issues.

60
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,849
Sean Jeffries, the press secretary,
has resigned.

61
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,934
And there are probably
more departures to come.

62
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,853
Her cabinet has had enough.

63
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,939
And if she thinks a pardon
is gonna keep the US Attorney away,

64
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,857
- she's...
- She's...

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,943
- Depressed.
- I don't know about depressed.

66
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,697
You know, she looks either very disturbed,
or depressed.

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,907
But, I mean, "disturbed"?
Can you really say that?

68
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,867
Yeah. Look, hold on.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm asking a very real question
about her ability to lead here.

70
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,831
Have you seen this photo? Because we have.

71
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,294
Now we're not here to diagnose,
but you look at this, and you need to ask.

72
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,463
[Cruz] On behalf of our country,

73
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,300
that woman undid 30 years
of foreign policy

74
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,304
by acting like,
pardon my French, a... [bleep]

75
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,390
But now,
now we're into a new phase.

76
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,393
When the White House lights are on,
but nobody's home.

77
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,979
I mean, she's home, but she won't leave.

78
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,275
Been hunkered down in there
for 23 days and counting.

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,236
Apparently, she's stopped doing anything.

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
She's paralyzed.

81
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,282
A paralyzed... [bleep]

82
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,827
And there's nothing more dangerous
than a paralyzed... [bleep]

83
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,374
Seriously,
I think she might be the worst thing

84
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,667
that has ever happened to this country.

85
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,586
SOS.

86
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,048
Save our souls, save our ships,

87
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,466
Take your pick.

88
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,595
This [bleep] is real.

89
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,933
I'm Melody Cruz, and that's what I got.

90
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,230
Hi.

91
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,858
That's quite a snapshot, right?

92
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,404
Unique. Carefully calibrated.

93
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,990
Pain, hysteria

94
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,451
and just a small dose of crazy.

95
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,871
Claire Underwood,
like they've never seen before.

96
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,795
It's actually not as easy as it looks.

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,465
See, in order for me to make that face,

98
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,092
I have to imagine...

99
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,262
the perfect combination of things.

100
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,514
Here's the recipe.

101
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,017
First, I have to think about all the ways

102
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,564
in which men have tried
to manage me my whole life.

103
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,275
Then, I think of...

104
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,320
America's worst fear...

105
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,159
when it comes to a female
in the Oval Office.

106
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,076
[door opens]

107
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,096
- [Kelsey] Her schedule has been cleared.
- And finally...

108
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
[Mark and Kelsey chattering]

109
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,209
...my biggest regret...
Francis J. Underwood.

110
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,384
- [knock on door]
- [sighing]

111
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,724
Madam President.

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,732
Are you ill?

113
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,196
If you're ill,
I'll call the White House physician.

114
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,621
Claire.

115
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,916
Just get out, Mark.

116
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,628
- Claire, this has to stop.
- Please, just leave me alone.

117
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,091
You are alarming the nation.
You need to get up.

118
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,302
Listen.

119
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
I've prepared a short statement

120
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,606
explaining your absence
and announcing your return.

121
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,817
You can deliver it
in the Rose Garden this afternoon.

122
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,278
I promise you
this is for both of our sakes.

123
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,030
[sniffles] You don't understand...

124
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,233
[Mark] If you would, please.

125
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,451
Claire...

126
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,120
look at me.

127
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,706
- Look at me.
- Get out.

128
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,959
Please get out. Just leave me alone.

129
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,337
You are not only digging your own grave,
you are burying the presidency. Stop it.

130
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
You can try.

131
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,258
- Can you try?
- [gasping] I can't, Mark.

132
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,842
I just can't.

133
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
[sighs]

134
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,265
I can't. [shudders, sighs]

135
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,101
[panting]

136
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,154
Don't worry.

137
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,489
I have a plan.

138
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,534
[electronic whirring]

139
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
[man] Excuse me.

140
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,541
[man] Sir.

141
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,587
We're good here?

142
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,422
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

143
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,426
Was it paranoia or is it due diligence?

144
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,052
You tell me, Mark.

145
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,348
We both just lived through
what that bitch is capable of.

146
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,767
Something is definitely wrong.

147
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,226
She...

148
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,188
Coffee?

149
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,276
I mean, she can't even
put two sentences together.

150
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,861
[Annette] Are you sure?

151
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,821
I've never seen her like this.
She's a mess.

152
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,196
Well...

153
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,243
Either way,
that doesn't change where we are.

154
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,995
And, Mark...

155
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,913
when Conway imploded,

156
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,792
we recognized
that you were a little squea...

157
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,919
squeamish about stepping in.

158
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,172
And we appreciate that.

159
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,673
But it's time.

160
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,801
You'll make a great president.

161
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,013
- We'll see to that.
- Now, wait, wait. Let's be clear, okay?

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,142
I know we've been hitting her pretty hard,

163
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,603
but I can't condone another attempt.

164
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,480
- I can't.
- Calm down.

165
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,440
My God, Mark. I mean, really.

166
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,108
There are other ways.

167
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,070
Okay, so we're talking about impeachment

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,613
or a congressional government?

169
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,407
25th Amendment, Section 4.

170
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,453
- Which has never been used.
- [Annette] It's built for speed,

171
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,122
intended to smother a crisis
of confidence.

172
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,249
Reassure the public.

173
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,959
Reassure the world

174
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,253
that continuity remains
at the American government,

175
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,214
even if a president becomes...

176
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,051
- Unable to fulfill his duties.
- Her duties.

177
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,512
- It requires her to be unfit.
- And she is.

178
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,765
I mean...

179
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,309
our lawyers have already looked into this.

180
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,395
She only needs to be deficient.

181
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,731
The language is vague and accommodating.

182
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,610
Mark, if you have any doubt about this

183
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,320
- at all...
- I'm just listening.

184
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,574
The Cabinet is yours.

185
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,704
You have relationships inside the Senate,

186
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,123
the House, on both sides of the aisle.

187
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,291
It's a natural fit.

188
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,461
But the thing has to cascade with...

189
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,838
Precision.

190
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,425
A chain reaction beginning
with a letter to Congress,

191
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,511
signed by the vice president

192
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,349
and a majority of his Cabinet,
recommending my removal from office.

193
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,769
And how do I know
that's what they'll try to do?

194
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
Because the 25th gets personal.

195
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,068
Bill likes me being the damsel
in distress.

196
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,071
He wishes I were.

197
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,323
[gulps]

198
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,537
Where you headed?

199
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,873
I have family up north.

200
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,956
Where?

201
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,333
North.

202
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,337
Cathy's sister still on the Cape?

203
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,048
Hyannis, right?

204
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,134
It's good.

205
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,762
Family's important.

206
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,741
- Especially during trying times...
- I'd invite you in, but I really...

207
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,808
There's still something
that I can't get straight.

208
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,311
If we could go through it
one more time. So...

209
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,938
she was picked up by car
to be taken to the doctor.

210
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,502
- She wasn't feeling well. - You were with her the whole
time -leading up to the embolism? - Mr. Stamper, enough!

211
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,788
I'm just trying
to understand what happened.

212
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't need you
coming around here anymore.

213
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,160
You know exactly what happened.

214
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,746
You have the coroner's conclusions.
And that's that.

215
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,545
I'm in mourning for my wife,

216
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,841
and I'm not reliving the final moments
of her life anymore. Not with you.

217
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,552
I think your wife was murdered.

218
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,267
I'm closing the door now.

219
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,190
[car alarm chirps]

220
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,868
[phone ringing]

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,668
- Hello.
<i>- Doug. Fred Amburg here.</i>

222
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,922
- Whose phone is this?
<i>- This one's mine.</i>

223
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,131
I just got out.

224
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,424
<i>I had no idea.</i>

225
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,176
<i>I talked to Cole this morning.</i>

226
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,388
Heard an interesting thing
about our esteemed shrink.

227
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,141
You know, that sabbatical, leave,
walkabout, whatever you want to call it.

228
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,894
<i>You are looking for him, aren't you?</i>

229
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,104
Yes.

230
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,815
<i>He's in a cabin down in Virginia.</i>

231
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,546
Here you go.

232
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,014
Would you mind if I...?

233
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,556
Thanks.

234
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,065
[phone line trilling]

235
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,734
[phone ringing]

236
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,781
[beeps]

237
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,659
Oh, hello?

238
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,163
[Fred] <i>Don't say another word.</i>
<i>Don't speak. Just wait.</i>

239
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Ah...

240
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
[grunts]

241
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,690
My apologies, I took a wrong turn
and wound up in some stairwell.

242
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,360
We don't have much time
until we have to get back upstairs.

243
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,114
When Marcy first came to me
with this proposition,

244
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,203
I was stunned, to say the least.

245
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,580
Until recently I...

246
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,084
I don't know. I didn't realize
how truly bad things were.

247
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,752
But unseat the president?

248
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,253
Jesus Christ.

249
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,673
President's my friend.

250
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,179
And while I worry about her mental state,

251
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,807
I worry about the state
of this nation more.

252
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,310
Mr. Vice President, I admire you greatly.

253
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,688
But I'm not used to this kind of thing.

254
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,564
Back rooms, after hours.

255
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,358
We need to take every precaution.

256
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,027
And yet we're still at risk
just by being here.

257
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,195
I'm sorry,

258
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,031
but I believe in the sanctity
of the office of the presidency.

259
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,915
[Siegerson]
And that's exactly why we're here.

260
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,035
You're asking us to betray an oath.

261
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,745
I'm asking you to speak your mind.

262
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,957
A concentrated effort,
all of us in this room.

263
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,268
We may not be able to save the president,

264
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,837
but we may just be able
to save our administration.

265
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,506
[man] The 25th is not just about timing.

266
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,967
It's about secrecy.

267
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,970
- And the Senate hasn't kept a secret...
- [Mark] Earl, I appreciate that.

268
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,305
I have the House,
and I'll take care of the Senate.

269
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,449
[Siegerson] I'll prepare a letter

270
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,726
detailing the president's dereliction
of duty,

271
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,854
laying out a case for Congress
and for posterity.

272
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,481
And when the time comes,
you'll all be notified.

273
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,191
[Mark] Look, we're all patriots here.

274
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,944
[sighs] Our first concern,

275
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,989
our only concern, has got to be...

276
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,783
the survival of our nation.

277
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,216
[crickets chirping]

278
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,489
[sighs]

279
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,454
[exhales]

280
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,219
[Rosen] Fuck! Ah!

281
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,428
[panting] [laughs]

282
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,140
[both sigh]

283
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,435
- Sit and take a deep breath.
- [exhales]

284
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,146
Sit down.

285
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,903
Dr. Rosen, sit down.

286
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,038
[panting]

287
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
How did you get in here?

288
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,008
I'm assuming you're here
because you're suffering.

289
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,637
And if it's not over Zoe Barnes,

290
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,432
it's over some other soul
that you've torn apart.

291
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,516
No.

292
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,312
You're assuming I'm here because
I figured out what you took from me.

293
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,732
- Took?
- Kept.

294
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,199
All personal property
should have been returned upon release.

295
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,743
You're right. It should have.

296
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,747
There's no accounting for the behavior
of supposed professionals.

297
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:34,256
[clears throat]
I once met this psychologist, socially,

298
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,759
who told me about a party that
she hosted once for a group of her peers.

299
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,720
It was just a roomful of shrinks.

300
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,222
At the end of the night,
she was cleaning up,

301
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,515
she went into the bathroom

302
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,102
and she saw that one of her colleagues
had smeared shit

303
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,313
all over the bathroom wall.

304
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,816
Now, what kind of fucked up person
would do something like that?

305
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,530
Well, I guess it's true what they say.

306
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,699
That shrinks
are the most fucked up of all.

307
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,867
[Rosen sighs]

308
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,455
Such a violence to that act.

309
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,084
But violence is a funny thing.

310
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,880
You know, it's not so much
the physical pain

311
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,506
that can victims can remember.

312
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,384
It's the feelings around it.

313
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,554
- The fear.
- [shouts]

314
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,226
Where is it? The will you intercepted?
Where is it?

315
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,478
I don't have it anymore. [whimpering]

316
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,729
[glass shatters]

317
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,191
I don't have it!

318
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,278
What was in it?

319
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
[gasping]

320
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,618
He left you everything.

321
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,496
[coughs]

322
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,292
[sobbing]

323
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,636
God...

324
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
[Doug] Take it.

325
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
[Rosen] Thank you.

326
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,026
I thought it was a strange question.

327
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,736
What?

328
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,490
When you asked me what Francis Underwood
had given me.

329
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,744
That's how the will ends.

330
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,539
"Remember the last thing I gave you."

331
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,925
Don't call her or I'll be back.

332
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,513
Hope you figure out your problems, Doctor.

333
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,598
[crying]

334
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,003
[Claire] Take it.

335
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,132
If you want it, it's yours.

336
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,848
Do you ever wonder if you're living
somebody else's life?

337
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,059
Whose life are you living, Jane?

338
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,894
Not me. You.

339
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,938
You seem to be struggling
with your identity.

340
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,608
If that's not too impertinent
to say to a...

341
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,360
sitting president.

342
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,406
Come keep me company
while I put my jammies on.

343
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,790
Please.

344
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,471
Your little show of compliance
at the funeral

345
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,308
as you made your side deal with Victor.

346
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,978
Makes me wonder.

347
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,315
And now what?

348
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,484
What do you call this show?

349
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,947
How to turn 323 million people against you
in three short weeks?

350
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,366
Congratulations, Claire.

351
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,202
You've become a problem for everybody.

352
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,370
And...

353
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,915
Just so you know,

354
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,752
Syria may be too far gone.

355
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,587
Tell me what to do, Jane.

356
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,175
I was at an event tonight.

357
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,595
An event the president usually attends.

358
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,932
And how was that evening?

359
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,229
The storm that's gathering is a rough one.

360
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,066
When you think they'll strike?

361
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,902
I have no idea.

362
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,327
It's late.

363
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,538
That's exactly what I'm saying.

364
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,462
I think I should move out.

365
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,051
I understand.

366
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,517
Stick to this course, Madam President,

367
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,227
and...

368
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,034
[Kelsey] Full house.

369
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,994
You must be looking for different answers

370
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,347
to the same questions
we've been going over for the last...

371
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,247
Now, 24 days.

372
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,531
And the president still hasn't left the residence.
- And this is where I say... - [woman] Kelsey, come on.

373
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,798
For now, the ground-breaking accord
with Russia,

374
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,636
which aims for a just and lasting peace
in Syria, speaks for itself.

375
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,762
So,

376
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:18,016
unless there are any more questions,
or shall I say new questions? Yes.

377
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,685
Isn't the vice president
really the one running the show,

378
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,979
essentially acting as president?

379
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,733
There are members of the cabinet
who are saying as much.

380
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,904
Well, firstly, I would refrain
from using the word "show,"

381
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,448
- when it comes to the White House.
- [woman scoffs]

382
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,284
And... yeah. That's all for today.

383
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,453
- [shouting]
- Thank you.

384
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,710
Are you sure you're not hungry?

385
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
The soup is quite nice.

386
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,800
I don't know how you can...

387
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,175
Eat?

388
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,846
[sighs] No, I'm...

389
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,932
glad to see you're eating.

390
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,396
Madam President, it's beyond repair.

391
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,523
You understand that, at this point?

392
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,610
You've lost the Hill.

393
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,279
You've lost your cabinet.

394
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,698
You've lost the country.

395
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,159
You've lost.

396
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,123
Your own party can't even
find a reason to support you.

397
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,041
I entreat you...

398
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,668
You entreat me?

399
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,046
Resign.

400
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,295
And are you speaking to me as vice
president? I'm speaking to you as a person.

401
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
Blame it on...

402
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,769
the strain after Francis' death,
the strain of the office itself.

403
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,857
Language can be found,
but the best you can hope for now...

404
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,652
is a dignified exit.

405
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,250
What's so moving about him
is he can't help himself.

406
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,420
He can't help being decent. Human.

407
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,506
His glorious flaw.

408
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,384
What this means is

409
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,345
they're gonna go through with it.

410
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,809
No, Mark.

411
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,437
I'm staying right where I am.

412
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,131
[police radio chatter]

413
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,295
[man] You got two minutes.
That's not Rachel Posner.

414
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,641
Is it?

415
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
You knew Rachel Posner.

416
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,231
Uh, I mean...

417
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,899
yeah, I guess.

418
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,984
Enough to use her name
for someone else's ID?

419
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,445
That's what you do, isn't it?
Kind of pay the names forward?

420
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,363
No.

421
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,948
What name did you give Rachel?

422
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,658
I don't remember.

423
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,451
I don't.

424
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,162
When did you last see her?

425
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,291
Come on. Um...
Couple of years ago or something.

426
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,085
It was where she worked.

427
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,377
Is she dead?

428
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,426
- I got nothing to do with that.
- Did you help kill her?

429
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,509
[man] Oh.

430
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,345
I'm talking to you.

431
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,601
Hey, hey, hey, man. I want my lawyer.

432
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,812
Do you know...

433
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,605
Doug Stamper?

434
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,314
No.

435
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,151
What name did you give her?

436
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,527
What was her name?

437
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,612
Lisa.

438
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,157
- Lisa?
- Yeah. Lisa Cassie.

439
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,533
- Lisa Cassie?
- Cassie, Lisa.

440
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,535
- [man] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [Hammerschmidt] <i>Lisa and Cassie?</i>

441
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,662
Back at the White House.

442
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,540
You took his room.

443
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,835
It's bigger.

444
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,218
Can you tell me why it was so important
that we meet here and now?

445
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,387
Honestly, I was hoping we could meet
in the West Wing.

446
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,890
I haven't left the residence in...

447
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,893
Well, I'm sure you still read the news.

448
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,230
And your pardon...

449
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,816
hasn't helped me or Francis.

450
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,985
I don't feel comfortable here.

451
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,278
[sighs]

452
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,408
Whatever bad memories
you may have, Doug...

453
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,454
sometimes it takes a long time
to understand

454
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,790
who's the real source of our harm.

455
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,627
And I have failed to make you trust me,

456
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,754
and that's a shame.

457
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,721
I trust what I know.

458
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,560
You have enemies,
and they underestimate you.

459
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
And how do you think they'll come at me?

460
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,399
Has Congressman Cole said anything to you?

461
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,652
I think she's alive.

462
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
Cathy Durant.

463
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,817
I don't know where she is
or what she's up to, but...

464
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,450
I knew you'd want to know.

465
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,376
I want you to know something.

466
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,589
Francis died in this room.

467
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,550
I told everyone it was in my bed.

468
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,013
But it was right there on the floor.

469
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,931
Whoever killed him.

470
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,188
Am I missing something?

471
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,983
Whoever killed him

472
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,320
will get what she or he deserves.

473
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,082
Timing decided the shape of the universe.

474
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,709
[man] Who said that?

475
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,792
Me.

476
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,422
Hell is truth seen too late.

477
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,091
Did you say that?

478
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,801
Thomas Hobbes.

479
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,345
Usher...

480
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,514
your bet.

481
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,518
- Hmm. I'll check, please.
- Don't be polite.

482
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,520
I played with you before.

483
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,064
I know you're holding.

484
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,106
Bill, you sure?

485
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,275
I can deal you in on the next hand.

486
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,528
- I don't play.
- Is it true she's a basket case?

487
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,864
Or just a plain old Democrat.

488
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,408
- [laughing]
- So, I'll have the letter.

489
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,410
That's a hundred to see mine.

490
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,162
And when it comes time, Hank,

491
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,499
I don't want to end up on the Senate floor
with a piece of paper in one hand...

492
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,627
And your balls in the other?
We've all been there.

493
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,379
Just keep my balls out of it.

494
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,923
Usher, you want me to whip,
but you don't want me

495
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,258
to tell my senators
what they're voting on.

496
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,427
And pass without debate.

497
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,511
I'm out.

498
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,931
At least tell me what they're getting.

499
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,685
A new resident in the White House.

500
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,275
[Hank] Well, Mr. President.

501
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,903
Are you in or are you out?

502
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,532
I call.

503
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,034
And...

504
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,664
Um... bump you 500.

505
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,380
[Duncan]
I would never call this enemy territory.

506
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,091
It might sound quaint,

507
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,093
but I believe in the Republic.

508
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,554
[Claire] Oh. Well, thank you for coming.

509
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,851
[sighs] It's not sustainable.

510
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,103
This media onslaught.

511
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,024
I wonder if you'd consider
calling off the dogs.

512
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,819
All I'm asking for is a pause.
Couple of days or so.

513
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,655
You flatter me, Madam President.

514
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,324
But my reach only goes so far.

515
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,160
It seems they want you to resign.

516
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,661
Who's they?

517
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,746
Who isn't?

518
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,080
Pardon my bluntness.

519
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,875
Oh, no, I enjoy bluntness. Saves time.

520
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,253
But should I resign
for the high crime of being a female?

521
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,547
Oh, I think the reasoning
goes deeper than that.

522
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,466
I think...

523
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,802
and this is just my perspective,

524
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,055
- if you want to hear it.
- Oh, please.

525
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,433
Dueling agendas between my family,

526
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,395
and, well, you,
have taken on their own life.

527
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,941
And in some sense,
your husband just won't leave you alone,

528
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,567
will he?

529
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,656
I can't change history.

530
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,575
I'll bet sometimes you'd like to.

531
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,079
Wouldn't you like to erase him?

532
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,205
Madam President...

533
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,209
your dead husband told my mother things.

534
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,503
Things you don't want the world to know.

535
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,548
A dead man's words are worthless
as far as I'm concerned.

536
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,218
Not when his claims can be verified.

537
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,642
It's possible to make the memory
of a person disappear.

538
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,061
Digitally.

539
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,439
Move them far
into the background, anyways.

540
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,400
There are ways.

541
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,320
Algorithms.

542
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,200
You're a very confident young man.

543
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,828
Even your deeds can go away.

544
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,997
Now, I can make it easier
for all of us to work together.

545
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Does your mother know you're here?

546
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,171
No.

547
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,845
Just out of curiosity,
what's your first memory?

548
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,099
Your first memory of her?

549
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,269
That's a strange question.

550
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,646
I was just curious.

551
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,319
I have a photograph of her catching me.

552
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,782
My mother had thrown me up into the air,

553
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,619
and my uncle snapped a picture
on his new Nikon camera.

554
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,081
She's beaming.

555
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,500
Gleeful.

556
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,629
I treasure that photo.

557
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,592
It's how I like to think of her.

558
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,306
[inhales sharply] Do me a favor.

559
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,932
Ask Annette...

560
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,894
Ask your mother where you came from.

561
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,034
It's still light out?

562
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,246
[sighs]

563
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,874
You're very dehydrating.

564
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,182
I know, I know.

565
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,851
You want to talk about the deal.

566
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,107
[clicks tongue] You excluded me, Jane.

567
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,029
When the dust settles,
I'll give you what you want.

568
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,908
Never doubted your value.

569
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,264
Have you seen my phone?

570
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,142
It's in the restroom.

571
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,331
[sighs]

572
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,883
Shit.

573
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,518
Did you do something to my...

574
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,617
I went to the EPA.

575
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,411
There is nothing.

576
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,371
Jesus Christ.

577
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,584
There are people walking around this town,

578
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,587
dressed down, acting like they belong.
But I know they don't.

579
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,466
- Have you been threatened?
- Come on, they're too smart for that.

580
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,721
Well, so they're following you.

581
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,933
- But if there's nothing, then there's...
- I have screenshots...

582
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,811
of the e-mail chain.

583
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,524
'Cause it's wrong what they did.

584
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,153
'Cause I'm so stupid.

585
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,996
So stupid to believe
in doing the right thing

586
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,948
in this totally fucked up world.

587
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,076
[sighs]

588
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,220
There's an e-mail from Bill Shepherd's office
in the chain. [scoffs] I told you. They knew.

589
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,087
They knew somebody was gonna die.

590
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,096
I gotta go.

591
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,314
Hey! Hey, wait.

592
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,399
What?

593
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,734
Your phone.

594
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,362
- What about it?
- I don't trust it.

595
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,533
I got rid of mine. I swear, it felt like
they were following my phone and not me.

596
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,911
- How?
- Look, I gotta go. I'll reach out to you.

597
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,414
- Okay?
- No. What...

598
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,364
[panting] She's somewhere in Saudi Arabia.

599
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,161
Ma'am, she poses a significant risk
in enemy hands. You know that.

600
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,913
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

601
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,624
No negotiations.
Options are being drawn up at SOCOM.

602
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,127
But nothing can happen
without an executive order.

603
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,503
Well, then.

604
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,630
That's gonna have to happen
when you're president.

605
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,550
No one's secrets are safe
with Jane in captivity.

606
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,345
That may be more concerning for you
than it is for me.

607
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,683
Kicking the hornet's nest.
Time to move this thing along.

608
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,646
- You arrogant little prick.
- Please, just calm down.

609
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,090
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

610
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,774
I'm not staying if there's name-calling.

611
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,194
Oh. There's not enough names
to call him, Annie.

612
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,280
- Such stunning stupidity.
- Nice alliteration, Uncle Bill.

613
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,574
This towel is smarter than you.

614
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,494
This window is smarter than you.

615
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,829
This rug is smarter than you.

616
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,123
- Hello, Seth.
- Hello, sir.

617
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,083
Seth is smarter than you!

618
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,295
The sweat on my brow
is smarter than you, Duncan.

619
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,797
- Jesus H. Christ, spare us.
- Because sweat on my brow,

620
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,258
would have at least known
not to pay an unsanctioned visit

621
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,942
- to the President of the United States.
- Get your hands off him.

622
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,931
I know you're not feeling well, but...

623
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,892
Well, what the hell
is that supposed to mean, anyway?

624
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,143
You can't act like this.

625
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,395
You know, I was trying to help.
She invited me and...

626
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,231
And you went, like a fucking idiot...

627
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,524
I wanted to be a bridge.

628
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,193
[Annette]
Shut up, both of you, just shut up.

629
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,320
God, is there anything
we haven't done for you?

630
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,364
Well, you know,
that's what people do for family.

631
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,950
- Anything.
- Listen, you shouldn't have gone.

632
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,786
She can't be trusted,
as I've told you a million times.

633
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,538
He jeopardized our timing.

634
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,540
He jeopardized our timing with her!

635
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,917
I can't stand the sound
of male arguing anymore.

636
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,835
You know, she told me
to ask you something.

637
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,256
She told me to ask you where I came from.

638
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,766
[Annette] Seth. Seth!

639
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,477
Sixteen weeks.

640
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,531
The one from the pregnancy
with her husband.

641
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,022
Annie, I do think it'd be a mistake.

642
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,399
Seth, confirm it.

643
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,193
- That's right. Sixteen weeks.
- Her husband told me.

644
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,946
But you don't know
how it's gonna play. Okay?

645
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,240
It could backfire. Get her sympathy.

646
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:01,603
- [Annette] Who waits 16 weeks? - The narrative can't be controlled...
What kind of person, that's what people will be talking about.

647
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,915
Let's get Mark on the phone.
We start this now.

648
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,718
Only "Lisa" is what we called her.

649
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,846
The lady at Central Market,
where she worked,

650
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,016
said you stopped by
a few times asking for her.

651
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,434
She owed us some money, but...

652
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,936
She dead?

653
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,062
Hmm. I don't know.

654
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,658
There's not much in there.

655
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,869
Some letters.

656
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,872
Scraps and lists and...

657
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,292
Picture.

658
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,128
Nothing, really.

659
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,299
<i>Our country has a problem right now.</i>

660
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,550
<i>The president,</i>

661
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,637
<i>she has ignored the advice
of her senior advisers,</i>

662
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,431
<i>people who have studied
and fought battles.</i>

663
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,225
<i>Her state of mind has left us
in a weakened...</i>

664
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,604
[sighs] <i>We need to hold the line</i>

665
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,898
<i>till our country gets back on course.</i>

666
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,692
That is a truly stunning video.

667
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,779
What is your reaction
to the secretary of defense's critique

668
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,863
of this president?

669
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,158
Secretary Defense Hanna
is a four-star Marine General

670
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,119
with over 40 years of service
to this country.

671
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,580
I understand his frustration.

672
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,292
Is there any truth to the idea
that Mark Usher

673
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,795
is the Dick Cheney of this White House?

674
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,755
No, there is only one Dick Cheney.

675
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,191
- Okay, fair enough.
- Mark Usher is

676
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,633
the Mark Usher of this White House.

677
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,009
So, how would you characterize

678
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,845
- the vice president's role?
- The vice president

679
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,473
<i>has the full support
of the entire cabinet.</i>

680
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,641
<i>And the president?</i>

681
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,685
<i>Well, the president speaks for herself.</i>

682
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,187
<i>Are you suggesting that
the secretary of defense</i>

683
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,565
<i>is not the only one
who's frustrated with this president?</i>

684
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:57,111
<i>You know, Lawrence, this town
feeds off of rumor and gossip</i>

685
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,840
<i>- and it's counter-productive.</i>
- Raha? [Siegerson] <i>It's a distraction. I don't work that way.</i>

686
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,926
[O'Donnell] <i>You don't work that way.</i>
<i>How do you work?</i>

687
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,494
<i>- How do you work with this president?</i>
- You have a call.

688
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,287
It's your president.

689
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,456
<i>Is this a dysfunctional administration?</i>

690
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,140
[Siegerson] <i>My relationship with this...</i>

691
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,418
[Jane] <i>Claire.</i>

692
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:18,382
Jane, I just need to know exactly
when they're going to pull the trigger.

693
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,600
<i>Don't you want to come home?</i>

694
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,356
You look like you're having fun.

695
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,569
I see real affection there.

696
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,865
And, listen, there were rumors
about Tom and me, of course,

697
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,616
but nothing to them.

698
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,535
He was like a brother to me.

699
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,120
So comforting.

700
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,542
Which is what makes this
all the more difficult.

701
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,087
The truth is, Kelsey...

702
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,757
the Russians killed Tom...

703
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,843
and Mark Usher covered it up.

704
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,013
Now, I'm doing my best
to hold him accountable,

705
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,181
but I need your help.

706
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,935
I need you to tell the FBI

707
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,562
about your relationship with Tom.

708
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,647
- Madam President, I...
- I know. It's fine.

709
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,150
You just say you were dating.

710
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,194
You were in love.

711
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,488
And in a private moment,

712
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,742
he told you about
his suspicions regarding

713
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,787
Mark Usher and his collusion with Russia.

714
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,998
And the last time you saw him,

715
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,083
he was on his way
to the vice president's home

716
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,168
to confront him.

717
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,799
I'm not going to let the vice president
get away with this.

718
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,469
You and I, as women,

719
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,972
we have to fight back.
I need you by my side.

720
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,901
And before we transmit the letter,

721
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,696
I'd like to suggest we all take a moment
to bow our heads

722
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,199
and pray for this great nation.

723
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,264
Could you pass me that letter?

724
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,065
[Siegerson sighs]

725
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,449
And gather all of your things.

726
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,494
Every single cabinet member in this room

727
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,745
is dismissed.

728
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,247
You're all fired.

729
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,165
[murmuring]

730
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,542
[Claire] Escort them out.

731
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,378
[chattering]

732
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,551
You know,

733
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:12,014
I never took you for someone
who wanted to get himself into the Oval.

734
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,018
All it is, is a four year job,
eight if you're lucky.

735
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,728
- [cell phone rings]
- [beep]

736
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,521
Hey, where are you?

737
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,898
What?

738
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,943
All right. I'm on my way back.

739
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,780
<i>Listen, if she prevented the signing,
that's obstruction.</i>

740
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,741
<i>And likely, it's impeachable.</i>

741
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,824
<i>You hear me?</i>

742
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,172
[Wolf Blitzer]
<i>Details are still coming in.</i>

743
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,372
<i>But we're being told there are reports
that the FBI...</i>

744
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,625
- Mark.
<i>- ...has today been provided evidence...</i>

745
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,811
- Get to a television.
<i>- ...that Mark Usher had quote...</i>

746
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,004
- Or a computer.
<i>- ..."significant and ongoing...</i>

747
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,380
Or a goddamn radio.

748
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,508
<i>...contact outside the logs
with Russian officials."</i>

749
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,969
<i>This leading up to
and during the president's</i>

750
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,722
<i>recent polarizing Syrian peace deal.</i>

751
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,183
<i>The FBI's expected
to look into the matter,</i>

752
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,186
<i>but has yet to announce
whether or not they are opening</i>

753
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,979
<i>an official investigation.</i>

754
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,691
<i>If so, this could be
a catastrophic setback</i>

755
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,277
<i>for an already-beleaguered administration.</i>

756
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:12,074
Before we begin, I'd like
to offer youthe chance to resign.

757
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,622
I'll leave you to it then.

758
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,004
I never had any contact
with any Russians outside the logs. None.

759
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,424
[woman] You vacationed at Deputy Foreign
Minister Zorkin's family dacha

760
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,861
- on the Black Sea in summer 1991.
- [Mark] That was 20 years ago.

761
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,821
[man] Let's work backwards,
start with questions that have arisen

762
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,806
after Ms. Kelsey Stewart's deposition.

763
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,889
Who?

764
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,478
We located her phone
in a liquor store in Bellport.

765
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,063
She knows about the app.

766
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,315
We should assume so.

767
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,109
Have you told my uncle yet?

768
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,027
- I can't reach him.
- [knock on door]

769
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,779
I can't reach your mother, either.

770
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,502
We have some men tracking the journalist.

771
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,992
But we don't even know
if she has her hands on anything yet.

772
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,745
- Package for Mr. Shepherd.
- Oh, thank you.

773
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,792
This is addressed to you.

774
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,555
Leave me alone, please.

775
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,861
<i>My name is Catherine Durant.</i>

776
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:35,073
<i>Today is Tuesday, July 18, 2017.</i>

777
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,035
<i>And the time...</i> [inhales]

778
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,995
<i>is 8:37 p.m.</i>

779
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,623
<i>Now, before I begin, let me just say...</i>

780
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,085
<i>that every punishment</i>

781
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:51,715
<i>that history will surely visit
upon Claire Underwood</i>

782
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,302
<i>will be exactly what she deserves.</i>

783
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,723
<i>I rue the day that I accepted
her husband's offer</i>

784
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,767
<i>of secretary of state.</i>

785
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
<i>Now, then...</i>

786
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,273
<i>I hereby swear that everything
I'm about to say</i>

787
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,357
<i>is the truth.</i>

788
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,570
Her husband has disappeared,
as of six hours ago.

789
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,198
- Do you want to hear any more?
- No.

790
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,282
I know the rest.

791
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,204
Do you think the Russians got them out?

792
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,540
Uh, no, I'm sure of it.

793
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,752
Do you think she sent it to anyone else?

794
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,504
We would know about it by now.

795
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,507
[Claire]
I've asked Nathan to be available to you.

796
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,510
I know how well you two work
with one another.

797
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,595
We'll find her.

798
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,809
And, Doug, I haven't forgotten about
the promise we made to each other.

799
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,268
I hope you haven't.

800
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,650
[sighs]

801
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,084
[line trilling, phone ringing]

802
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,176
[beep]

803
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,471
<i>I just got back from New Mexico.</i>

804
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,307
<i>What did you do with Rachel?
Or is it Cassie?</i>

805
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,103
I'm five minutes away.

806
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,521
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

807
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,897
- Doug...
<i>- Hang it up</i>

808
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,482
<i>or you'll never hear from me again.</i>

809
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,568
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

810
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,738
[beep]

811
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,164
Nathan,

812
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,125
<i>are you still listening?</i>

813
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,254
<i>You're a fool to think she'll protect you.</i>

814
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,714
[beeps]

815
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,515
Seems fitting, somehow,

816
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,561
that you're the first person I meet with
after I've returned to work.

817
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,814
There's something
very full circle about it.

818
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,775
So, you've talked to your son.

819
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,528
Or rather, not your son.

820
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,657
Do you know how developed
a fetus is by then?

821
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,118
Sixteen weeks is... beyond the beyond.

822
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,836
That is what 16 weeks looks like.

823
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,422
That is what I can't get out of my head.

824
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,675
I'm quoting Melody Cruz here, by the way.

825
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,470
She just taped her segment,
due to run tomorrow.

826
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,597
Visual aids and everything.

827
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,893
For the first time ever,
Americans will hear the story

828
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,061
of a childless president...

829
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,647
who had an abortion,

830
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,440
while married,

831
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,859
at 16 weeks.

832
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,737
I wanted to see your face.

833
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,573
I wanted to see Frank's betrayal register.

834
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,952
[sighs] Nobody can keep
their mouths shut these days.

835
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,329
Not even to-the-death secrets are safe.

836
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,580
It's shameful.

837
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,792
But honestly, what's worse?

838
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,877
That he betrayed your secret

839
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,338
or that you waited until 16 weeks?

840
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,839
You and your party.

841
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,301
Your moral rectitude, how convenient.

842
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,012
You don't even believe half
of what you say, Annette.

843
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
Run it.

844
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,266
Cruz's piece.

845
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,767
Run it.

846
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,645
And then go home

847
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,648
and talk to Duncan
about the beginning of life.

848
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,943
But actually before you go,

849
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,362
I want to show you something.
Come with me.

850
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,464
Meet my new cabinet.

851
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,761
I just wanted to see your face.

852
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,108
Thank you all for assembling
at such short notice.

853
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,986
And I want to thank you

854
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,530
for your willingness to serve.

855
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,493
I am looking forward
to building a new America together

856
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,663
and our work begins today.

857
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,708
Now, if you could all

858
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,419
place your left hand on the Constitution

859
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,754
in front of you.

860
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,715
And repeat after me:

861
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,509
I do solemnly swear
