1
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,196
[Abruzzo] I never had sex
with a farm animal

2
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,490
or abused a girlfriend,

3
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,701
unless you count marrying her.
[laughs] Let me say, it was tough, uh...

4
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,541
narrowing down
my ten most significant cases.

5
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,418
I prefer the smaller questions.

6
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:12,006
Of my professional memberships,
my teaching.

7
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,801
Madam President, just between you and me,

8
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,680
my feeling is that it's not as far-fetched
as some people say.

9
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,934
I still think there is a universe

10
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,687
where the ERA gets passed.

11
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,066
Women truly are the best, aren't they?

12
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,325
I am deeply honored to be considered
for the late Justice's seat.

13
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,328
So, tell me.

14
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
[knock on door]

15
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,168
How did they buy you? The Shepherds.

16
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,604
[Mark] Judge Abruzzo, Madam President,
I hate to break this up.

17
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,632
Oh, I have already taken too much
of the president's valuable time.

18
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,342
Madam President.

19
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,204
- Mr. Vice President.
- Your Honor.

20
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,764
It has been a sincere pleasure.

21
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,771
I'll set up Judge Michaels
for the end of the day tomorrow?

22
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,552
I have Secretary Durant waiting for you.
I felt emasculated.

23
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,574
[Mark] Excuse me.

24
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,787
Bill Shepherd guiding my hand.

25
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,707
And you looked emasculated, Mark.

26
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,962
- You're mistaken.
- No, I'm not mistaken.

27
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,607
- I watched your face.
- Madam President...

28
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,466
Please don't call me that. Please.

29
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,092
- Claire.
- Better.

30
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,638
- Claire.
- Yes. What?

31
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,321
That was not a fight you were gonna win.

32
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,308
- Do you like being the messenger?
- What?

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,810
Has it been a dream of some sort
since you were a little boy?

34
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,354
Because I can tell you something.

35
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,024
Once you identify the degree
to which you are boxed in,

36
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,817
you'll see how liberating it is.

37
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,361
Are you with me...

38
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,696
or are you with those horrible,
horrible people

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,156
you've attached yourself to?

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,951
Because I can tell you something
about Bill Shepherd.

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,452
I could smell it on him.

42
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,830
The way I could on my father,
on my mother.

43
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,791
He's sick.

44
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,001
- Well, he was.
- He is.

45
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,296
And then where will that leave you?

46
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,506
With her?

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,924
Annette Shepherd?

48
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,676
I know what that woman is,

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,845
and more to the point, <i>isn't</i> capable of.

50
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,267
And that little encounter
with the honorable Judge Abruzzo

51
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,894
at the fundraiser,
that was orchestrated too, wasn't it?

52
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,978
Yes.

53
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,193
I look at him sometimes
and imagine him at six years old.

54
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,154
Was he always so deliberative?

55
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,281
Cautious?

56
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,450
And I think in another life...

57
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,828
some other context

58
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,663
might we have been friends.

59
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,876
It's time to decide, Mark.

60
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,547
[woman on TV] <i>I hold every president</i>
<i>to the same standard.</i>

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,049
<i>Are you making America better,</i>

62
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,386
<i>or are you making America worse?</i>

63
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>That's all that matters...</i>

64
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,907
[Bill] Excuse me.
Could you turn this off, please?

65
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,809
- [man] Yes, sir.
- The level of discourse in this city.

66
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,313
I'm telling you. She does have a point.

67
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,233
You need to tell Duncan to be careful
when it comes to his pit bull.

68
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,194
City.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,741
FDR turned this place into a city.

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,786
With his agencies and armies of clerks.

71
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
All the professors that followed.

72
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,750
Before the war,
this was just a small Southern town.

73
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,836
One built of marble, yeah, but just a...

74
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,547
small town sitting on a swamp.

75
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,341
Place to visit.

76
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,633
Place to...

77
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,470
protect the Republic.

78
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,223
Secure States' rights. [scoffs]

79
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,934
That's not what it is today.

80
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,190
Some top-down money grab for bureaucrats,
lobbyists and the entire Democratic party.

81
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,818
- You've always been more Teddy.
- Than that traitor pig Franklin?

82
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,156
Look, I know it's a sacrifice for you
to be here, in Washington.

83
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,284
But for God's sake,
why take the same room he was in?

84
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,659
Well...

85
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,704
Well, he wanted to keep an eye on her.

86
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,958
Francis never could let go
of the White House.

87
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,462
But he did give us the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

88
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,756
She's not qualified.

89
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,384
She stole the damn thing.

90
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,596
If ever there was ever a chance
to shrink the office down to size,

91
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,057
it's the presidency of Claire Underwood.

92
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,935
Maybe you should run for office.

93
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,354
[sighs] I think that time has passed.

94
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,357
[coughs]

95
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,858
I'm worried about you.

96
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,319
Oh, don't be.

97
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,863
Never better.

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,703
Deregulation bill
is the first of a hundred,

99
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,622
ready and waiting.

100
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,333
- [sighs] The speed you're moving at...
- [door opens]

101
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,298
I can come back.
The lawyers are due any minute.

102
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,385
No, no. Come on in here.
Grab yourself a cup of something.

103
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,179
I know Annette wanted to talk to you
in person,

104
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
before the rest of the team arrives.

105
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,392
I passed on what you told me
about the president.

106
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,755
I want you to have it all before

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,437
Duncan got his hands on it.

108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,939
She admitted
to all three of the abortions.

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,234
But I can get you the names of the men.
Who they were.

110
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,446
No, I'm not comfortable with this.

111
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,823
Let's take that off the table for now.

112
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,116
She'll play along.

113
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,868
We'll make sure of it.

114
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,172
I always imagined
that if I were president,

115
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,799
I would want you to be a member
of my cabinet.

116
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,843
[both chuckle]

117
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,303
You look like a movie star.

118
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,265
Oh, well, it's the glare.
I get migraines since the fall.

119
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,393
- They can come on quite suddenly.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

120
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,939
The vice president said that you wanted
to meet me in person.

121
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,568
It's so good to see you.

122
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Sit.

123
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,161
Not everyone comes back
from a fall like that, Cathy.

124
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,329
Yes.

125
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,165
I'm starting to feel
like a proverbial cat.

126
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,042
[both laugh]

127
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,211
Take off your glasses,
let me see your eyes.

128
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,179
You have no shortage of stories.

129
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,388
You know that.

130
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,642
My memory's been very erratic lately.

131
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,061
Sometimes, I think I might just forget

132
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:44,190
the details of my time
in office altogether if...

133
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,359
If?

134
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:54,242
Honestly, I would love nothing more
than to just move on, Madam President.

135
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,078
Well, I understand
that you have a job offer.

136
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,330
Several. I'm lucky. [laughs]

137
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,458
The Eisenhower Strategic Initiative,
isn't it?

138
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,378
Yes, a think tank makes sense.
Outside of government.

139
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,129
Well, not entirely outside.

140
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,714
And heavily funded by...

141
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,552
A coalition of industrialists
and civic-minded folk, yes.

142
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,845
Big plans to change the world.

143
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,179
Hmm.

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,350
I haven't accepted.

145
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,685
But you want to.

146
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,647
You think I shouldn't take the job?

147
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,692
I think you should trust your gut, Cathy.

148
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,820
Take care of yourself.

149
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,700
Claire.

150
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,163
I'm sorry I didn't write after Francis...

151
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,082
Oh, there's no need to apologize.

152
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,004
I can still feel his hand...

153
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,298
on my back.

154
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,051
Cathy, he's gone.

155
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,850
Bill Shepherd got to her.

156
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,603
I can feel it. She's going to testify.

157
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,314
My lawyers tell me her team
is still negotiating,

158
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,898
maybe for a while yet.

159
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,234
She thinks she's safe with them,
with this job.

160
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,194
Instead they're gonna be
sentencing her to...

161
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,411
It needs to look like complications
from her fall.

162
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,040
I can have her detail pulled.
I still know some people.

163
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,417
The opportunity will present itself.

164
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,673
One last piece
connecting us both to Francis.

165
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,846
The world is either with us
or against us, Doug.

166
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,277
You think you'll ever wear them?

167
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,323
Doesn't feel right.

168
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,200
Do you know the last thing he said to me?

169
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,827
"Promise me you and Doug

170
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
will take care of each other."

171
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,882
I want to thank the National Gallery
for curating this magnificent exhibit.

172
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,885
Our hope is, in due time,

173
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,138
these works of art
will return to their rightful place

174
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,351
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

175
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,023
Mr. Nasser.

176
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,818
They're making a fool of you,
these Shepherds.

177
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,653
The special interests. The go-betweens.

178
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,490
Your so-called peacekeeping in Syria
was a shameless land grab

179
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,326
built on the lives of American soldiers
you sent into battle.

180
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,330
Then you can blame Jane Davis, Mr. Nasser.

181
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,414
I do.

182
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,752
I had hoped to renegotiate the deal
Jane helped broker many months ago.

183
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,755
Now I know that's impossible.

184
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,425
Oh, because she's conveniently
unavailable.

185
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,927
Because you're in no position to do so.

186
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,929
You've been excluded, just as I have.

187
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,806
They're stripping power from you.

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,517
Have you ever seen the Baathist playbook?

189
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,146
It was inspired by
American intelligence agencies.

190
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,232
Sometimes, you need to be an insurgent
in your own country.

191
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,035
Well, that's interesting.
Because presently,

192
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm meeting with a member
of a known terrorist organization.

193
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,948
[scoffs] Pardon me. But I'm a lawyer.

194
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,160
If you allow American corporate interests
to cut ICO out of Syria's future...

195
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,829
Are you about to threaten me, Mr. Nasser?

196
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,124
No, but we all know
what ICO is capable of.

197
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,668
I'm merely conveying a message
from one of my clients.

198
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,547
You and your client are one and the same.

199
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:43,241
Americans have such faith in their ability to keep things
and people safe. Mr. Nasser, Syria is a country of...

200
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,815
former schools, former homes,
former places of worship.

201
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,277
Your organization played a large part
in the destruction.

202
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,821
And so have you, Madam President.

203
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,741
I'm afraid I can't help you.

204
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,825
No...

205
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,370
you can't.

206
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,799
I got two daughters, a beautiful wife.

207
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,884
Paid my dues.

208
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,511
Four terms.

209
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,765
A Republican in a diverse district.

210
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,560
I got a ground operation second to none.

211
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,020
And my volunteers,

212
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,981
their sons and their daughters
are coming up right behind 'em. I just...

213
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,442
I just feel like, um...

214
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,971
this could be my moment, you know?

215
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,311
Fred told me about the legislation
about to be introduced.

216
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,366
Mm-hmm.

217
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,119
I'm co-signing.

218
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,330
- It's...
- Ambitious.

219
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,999
It's unprecedented.

220
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,252
It's bipartisan, is what it is.

221
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,837
You worked for her.

222
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,422
I worked for her husband.

223
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,759
Nobody wants her hands
on a nuclear football.

224
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,929
Or sending any more uniforms anywhere,
here or abroad.

225
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,099
You're gonna have to be okay with that.

226
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,516
Are you?

227
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,728
I owe her nothing.

228
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,228
So what do they have on you?

229
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,072
Hold on, slugger. [chuckles]

230
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,424
I'm still trying to get acquainted here.

231
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,994
[chuckles]

232
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,581
- Right.
- Where do you think you're going?

233
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,749
Fred Amburg asked me to meet you.

234
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,252
- Well, Fred asked me to meet you.
- And we've met.

235
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,089
Where do you get off?

236
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,843
- After where you've been.
- You mean where I was.

237
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,511
With Mr. Amburg.

238
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,179
The last person you worked for...

239
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,682
Became the President of the United States.

240
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,101
He pushed you out.

241
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,314
I am your chance.

242
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,110
You know, not that I have
to prove myself to you,

243
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,361
or to anyone else,

244
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,906
but I can find the opening,

245
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,701
the crack, the weak spot.

246
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,536
I don't know,

247
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,623
maybe it's a curse
to know what people fear.

248
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,208
Like you.

249
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,086
I think what scares you, Congressman.

250
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,880
Your base,

251
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,049
your ground game, all that love.

252
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,051
You thought you deserved it,

253
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,054
that it was meant for you and nobody else.

254
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
You got blind.

255
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,142
You forgot that they'd come for you.

256
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,686
But they will come.

257
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,230
That's how this business is built.

258
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,735
So, I'm going to ask you again.

259
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,113
What is it that they have on you?

260
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,580
My district covers O'Hare.

261
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,624
Pensions.

262
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,962
The baggage handlers. I...

263
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,756
[sighs]

264
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,133
Shit. It was stupid.

265
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,598
Well...

266
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,686
it's only stupid
if you can't make it go away.

267
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,276
Tom, calm down.

268
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,445
I'm getting too old to be polite.

269
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,031
Hear the deal out.
Content will not be changed.

270
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,325
And you and I both know better.

271
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,830
Something happened that night.

272
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,540
Their marriage was broken,

273
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,958
he went over there.

274
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,626
I'm not saying they're connected,

275
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,004
but the next day he winds up dead.

276
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,839
She knew an indictment was coming.

277
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,550
Do you understand what that means?

278
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,634
Then keep writing.

279
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,054
So they can turn it into a 140 characters
for clickbait?

280
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,098
We don't write anymore,

281
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,975
we come up with feed for the trough.

282
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,769
Put that goddamn thing down
before I smash it!

283
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,980
You need to go back in there

284
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,481
and apologize.

285
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,401
To whom, Dayna?

286
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,197
Our new boss is a voice on a speakerphone!

287
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,283
He doesn't even know I walked out.

288
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,830
Why don't we write
about how Gardner Analytics

289
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,498
is buying up television stations

290
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,462
and some of the greatest papers
in this country? "Analytics." Oh, my God.

291
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,050
What the fuck does that even mean?

292
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,633
[thump]

293
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,180
[Nathan] According to the autopsy,

294
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,015
natural causes.

295
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,142
[Doug] Heart attack?

296
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,311
[Nathan] Overdose of his liver medication.

297
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,813
Accidental, presumably.

298
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,736
- [Doug] What aren't you telling me?
- [Nathan] Nothing.

299
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,615
He would never do that intentionally.

300
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,285
Witnesses in the lobby
of the Hay-Adams that night

301
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,080
said the former president
was acting disoriented.

302
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,373
Did you share this with his widow?

303
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,375
She's the one
who asked me to look into it.

304
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,128
She suspects the Shepherds.

305
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,297
He was with them a lot,
but not that night.

306
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,383
- And who was?
- Other than her?

307
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,805
That was her husband, Doug.

308
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,265
She's the president.

309
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,519
Don't you sound devoted, Nathan.

310
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,022
My only contact with her
is in my official capacity.

311
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,234
Did you think you'd seen the last of me?

312
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,196
That's the last thing I thought.

313
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,242
I'll take that as a compliment.

314
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,496
Doug, here.

315
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,168
I tracked his comings and goings
back to when he left the White House.

316
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,506
I got my hands on the metadata going
into his computer.

317
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,095
LeAnn Harvey's camera phone
was streaming during the crash.

318
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,182
A direct feed to only one IP address.

319
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,934
Francis'.

320
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,269
His laptop.

321
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,397
It's not easy to watch, but...

322
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,067
- Okay.
- Up to you.

323
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,916
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

324
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,044
Duncan Shepherd.

325
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,464
I'm sorry I couldn't be
at the meeting in person this afternoon.

326
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,015
My walker drops him off when it's late.

327
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,184
Come.

328
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,357
- You saw my little outburst.
- [scoffs]

329
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,652
I enjoyed it.

330
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,946
The outrage.

331
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
We need more of it.

332
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,242
I especially liked your appearance
on television the other night.

333
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,620
- [dog whimpers]
- Yeah. Well...

334
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,039
I get a little heated sometimes.

335
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,750
It's exactly the kind of exposure
the <i>Herald</i> needs.

336
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Tom,

337
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,881
you're now part of a conglomerate

338
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,966
with vast influence and reach.

339
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,015
The point is I can bring you
whatever evidence you need.

340
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,559
- Hold on.
- Divorce for pardon.

341
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,103
There's a kernel of truth to it,
but your source...

342
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,691
And before you say anything,
consider what I'm offering.

343
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,735
An opportunity for justice.

344
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,780
If you're talking about
manufacturing evidence, Mr. Shepherd,

345
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,157
- I'm not interested.
- Beg to differ.

346
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,868
And spare me the seasoned
journalist routine, please.

347
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,870
Your 30 years in the business.

348
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,141
I've spoken to your old assistant, Angela.
She's written a piece about her time with you.

349
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,086
I could run it, or...

350
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,174
Your dogged pursuit of Frank Underwood,
pardon the pun,

351
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,051
is now your pursuit of his bride.

352
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,534
[Hammerschmidt] Hmm. [dog whimpers]

353
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,723
Think about it.

354
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,312
Men your age,
they unravel very easily these days.

355
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,860
[woman]
<i>Judge Vincent Abruzzo has the credentials.</i>

356
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,154
<i>The published writings,
the public statements.</i>

357
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,615
<i>It all checks out. Full package.</i>

358
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,243
<i>So what's the hesitation, Madam Prez?</i>

359
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,371
Beltway Television is owned
by Gardner Analytics.

360
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,581
It's the latest brainchild
of Duncan Shepherd.

361
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,626
So far, I've deflected all questions
regarding Ms. Cruz's commentary.

362
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,878
Good. Let's not dignify it.

363
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,514
No. That's fine, thank you.

364
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,019
- They were a hazard, I couldn't resist.
- [Claire chuckles]

365
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,149
Sorry I missed the funeral.
Were there psalms?

366
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,817
Number 42.

367
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,444
I love 42.

368
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,700
Nasser had no business
coming to you directly.

369
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,704
Well, I knew if I met with him,
you'd suddenly appear.

370
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,914
He feels lied to, Jane.

371
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,458
Because he was.

372
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,170
We were never gonna give those bandits
a seat at the table.

373
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,465
Jane, he's threatened more ICO attacks.

374
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,009
ICO is neutralized, mostly.

375
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,845
It's time to re-think our involvement
in Syria.

376
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,388
Stand down, rebuild.

377
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,059
This deal is important for all of us.

378
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,977
Including the Shepherds.

379
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,355
Look, I'm no fan of that family,

380
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,484
but in the case of Syria,
our interests align.

381
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,985
The next phase of our...

382
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,653
presence in the region

383
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,282
is more about the spoils than the peace.

384
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,534
The problem is Petrov,

385
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,536
whom the Shepherds and I despise.

386
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,080
What do you have on the Shepherds?

387
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,876
I'm sure one of the several agencies
you're involved with has something.

388
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,879
And don't you keep files
on everyone you're dealing with?

389
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,507
Bill and Annette are very careful.

390
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,425
What about Annette's son, Duncan?

391
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,763
Well, Mark knows them more than I do.

392
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,895
I thought there were better options
for a former president...

393
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,649
but Annette wouldn't leave Frank alone.

394
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,569
That's their problem,
they don't know when to stop.

395
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,741
You know, when you left three months ago,
I wondered where you'd gone.

396
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,704
And then, I didn't think of you at all.

397
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,916
You say that.

398
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,962
But I detect pain in your eyes,
Madam President.

399
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,426
As a deer longs for streams of water.

400
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,886
So I long for you, God.

401
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,347
Do you miss him?

402
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,226
God? Always.

403
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,110
I'd like you to move in here with me,
Jane, into the White House.

404
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,987
I need your counsel

405
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,407
and your perspective
when it comes to Mark.

406
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,455
The truth is that whole last year
in the White House...

407
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,416
I just lost myself.

408
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,671
And the crazy thing is,
I've never even met Zoe Barnes.

409
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,257
Is that what you told the US Attorney?

410
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,759
Or did you and Claire Underwood
make a deal?

411
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,887
The president and I
are on different paths.

412
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,723
You're saying you haven't seen her.

413
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,600
We've spoken.

414
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,811
I just don't see a role for me
in her White House.

415
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,732
I'm working with Congressman Cole.

416
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,319
He's making a play for speaker.

417
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,445
[Hammerschmidt] Hmm.

418
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,660
I left the <i>Herald</i> today.

419
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,248
If that's why you wanted to see me,

420
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,334
- make a pitch for your new guy.
- No.

421
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,961
No, this is about making amends.

422
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,922
Last fall I started drinking again.

423
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,839
No.

424
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,176
You picked this place because
it's full of bloggers and Hill rats.

425
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:16,306
Right now, everyone here can see us
talking together, like civilized people.

426
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,850
As if I never called you a murderer
in print.

427
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,689
Your latest article on Francis.

428
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,522
This story about the nights leading up
to his death?

429
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,367
You want to make amends?
Who are your sources?

430
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,239
Peter Russo.

431
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,449
Zoe Barnes.

432
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,243
LeAnn Harvey.

433
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:45,293
Doug, there isn't a shadow
for you to hide in anymore.

434
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,338
The only person knows everything is you.

435
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,923
I don't.

436
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,510
Let him go.

437
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,616
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,191
At some point, you're gonna have to decide.
Claire Underwood, believe me,

439
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,114
she'll come for you when it's time.

440
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,408
Thanks.

441
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,924
[Annette]
You know, there's caffeine in that.

442
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,010
I do.

443
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,598
I love that you love Arnold Palmers, but...

444
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,142
Arnold Palmer was a great man.

445
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,354
She still on your mind?

446
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,986
This arrangement isn't working.

447
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,364
Which arrangement?

448
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,700
Mark, come to bed.

449
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,955
She needs to feel some degree of autonomy.

450
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,582
Fuck autonomy.

451
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,459
She serves at our pleasure.

452
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,419
I'm sure she feels undervalued.

453
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,629
Undervalued?

454
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,756
Claire Hale? Please.

455
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,411
What if Bill doesn't get better?

456
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,512
He is better.

457
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,432
If we don't play this right,

458
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,893
in the public eye, we are doomed to fail.

459
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,062
- You know that, right?
- She's doomed, you mean.

460
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,897
Look... [clicks tongue]

461
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,107
Let's be clear.

462
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,111
I am not attracted to her,
but she needs to see me as a partner.

463
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,447
And what is the rush?

464
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,867
Bill wants a majority on the court.

465
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,994
He's waited a long time.

466
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,456
Let her at least look like the president.

467
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,126
I'll scuttle the nomination
if it comes to that later.

468
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,713
I want Judge Abruzzo, Mark.

469
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,216
And don't ever question
my brother's ability

470
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,385
to function at the highest level.

471
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,181
What is that Sylvia Plath line?

472
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,101
"She eats men like air."

473
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,977
Who are we talking about?

474
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,612
Hey.

475
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,532
Sorry we missed each other yesterday.

476
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,702
[Bill] <i>Well, my apologies for leaving you</i>
<i>in the lurch again today.</i>

477
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,828
Everything okay?

478
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,204
I spoke to Annette.

479
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,289
<i>I really think this is the best course.</i>

480
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,502
- Did you ever meet George?
<i>- George?</i>

481
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,464
My brother George. Incurious George.

482
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,299
No, I never did.

483
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,928
<i>And back in the old days,
we acquired an operation in the Midwest,</i>

484
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,763
<i>refining Canadian crude.</i>

485
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,932
<i>Profit margin was...</i> [inhales]

486
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,684
<i>It was staggering.</i>

487
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,935
But George,

488
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,563
he got all high-minded about it.

489
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:56,359
Thought that we were
bending too many laws. So he...

490
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:01,364
He bought a rival company,
green energy type, and he sued us.

491
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,533
<i>Sued us.</i>

492
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,118
<i>I mean...</i>

493
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,078
The betrayal.

494
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,958
My father's true religion was family.

495
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,918
And he was troubled.

496
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,796
He was deeply troubled
by what George had done.

497
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,298
Changed his will.

498
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,970
Any sibling bringing litigation
against any other at the time of his death

499
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,598
would automatically lose their share
of the inheritance.

500
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,892
Every damnable penny.

501
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,519
He used that word.

502
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,564
Which is exactly what happened to George.

503
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,650
Oh. George couldn't believe it.

504
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:43,281
Accused me of tricking Dad into doing it
when he was too weak to know his own mind.

505
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:47,035
My father always knew his own mind.

506
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,953
George...

507
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,747
[knock on door, opens]

508
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,333
...he was just so broken up about it.

509
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,378
Didn't even contest the will.

510
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,088
Which as far as I see it,

511
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,842
it means he had no place inheriting that
kind of money to begin with.

512
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,596
<i>The man had everything he ever needed.</i>

513
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,348
<i>He was just so...</i>

514
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,809
Short-sighted.

515
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,522
Lives on some island in Maine now.

516
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,399
<i>You know what the worst part for me was?</i>

517
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,944
<i>How much it upset Annette.</i>

518
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,113
<i>That was a no-go.</i>

519
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,283
<i>I'll get the nomination, Bill.</i>

520
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,953
Bye-bye now, Mark.

521
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,287
[beeps]

522
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,417
[sighs]

523
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,256
They were good enough to provide me
with a direct feed from the Hall.

524
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,591
[inhales, exhales]

525
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,930
- Is this necessary?
- Inhale.

526
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,350
[inhales, exhales]

527
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,936
- You ever seen Giselle?
- Mm-mm.

528
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,846
[man] Don't look at me like that.

529
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,071
The results aren't all bad.

530
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,243
[Doug] <i>I'm being watched.</i>

531
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,828
By whom?

532
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,123
<i>Tom Hammerschmidt, the US Attorney.</i>

533
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,167
<i>It's a feeling that I've had for a while.</i>

534
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,254
Hello?

535
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,755
<i>I'm here.</i>

536
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,175
It's too risky.

537
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,346
[chuckles] <i>If Francis had asked,</i>
<i>you'd have found a way.</i>

538
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,016
That's true.

539
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,310
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

540
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,022
I guess this is where we part ways, Doug.

541
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,399
It's for the best.

542
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,318
<i>Then say goodbye.</i>

543
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,284
You know what the last thing
he said to me was?

544
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,830
"I can't imagine a world
with only one of you in it."

545
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,379
[beep] [beep]

546
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,262
There comes a point in every relationship
where you wonder,

547
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,764
"Are you with me?"

548
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,892
Are you?

549
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,814
So, there are some loose ends
that Bill Shepherd is trying to exploit.

550
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,191
One being...

551
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,484
Cathy Durant.

552
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,612
And I have known each other
for a very long time.

553
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,821
I know.

554
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,866
Well, the last time I saw Cathy,
she looked at death's door.

555
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,458
You can't ask that of me.
She trusts you, Jane.

556
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,127
She trusts you.

557
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,923
That's making a move in broad daylight.

558
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,551
I enjoy having you here.

559
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,642
I'll never be able to forgive myself.

560
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,440
And when you told him about LeAnn?

561
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,317
He showed no emotion, ma'am.

562
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,987
- Where is he now?
- Still at home.

563
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,155
I have a couple of agents trailing him.

564
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,200
As far as the Bureau is concerned,
it's for Doug's own safety.

565
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,283
[Claire] Hmm.

566
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,123
And besides Congressman Cole,
has he met with anyone?

567
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,875
Other than myself, Tom Hammerschmidt.

568
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,048
Perhaps you should be the one on him.

569
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,884
In case we need to find him alone
at some point.

570
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,263
I continue to be very concerned
about his state of mind.

571
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,431
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,982
Francis left him everything
in his handwritten will.

573
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,068
Am I curious? Yes.

574
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,322
But not enough to wait for Douglas Stamper
to bring me down.

575
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,077
Secretary Durant,
Ms. Davis is in the back.

576
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,039
- Where's Sal?
- He's off. My name is Giancarlo.

577
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,498
It's a pleasure to meet you.

578
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,625
Right this way.

579
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,671
- Very slow today.
- Ah.

580
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,767
Please.

581
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,243
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,246
- Madam Secretary, please.
- I'm sorry, I'm...

583
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,664
Madam Secretary.

584
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,042

587
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,890
[phone buzzing]

588
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,522
- Hey.
- [Cathy] <i>Jane, how could you?</i>

589
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,190
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

590
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,210
- Listen to me, sweetheart.
<i>- No, you listen to me.</i>

591
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,527
Is this Claire?

592
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,612
Are you doing this for her?

593
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,863
<i>Oh, Cathy.</i>

594
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,241
<i>Once the decision is made,
you can't escape.</i>

595
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,660
Maybe it won't happen today, but...

596
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,787
someday,

597
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,039
someday, I'm afraid.

598
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,707
I curse you.

599
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:32,338
I curse you and wish you a painful death.

600
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:37,051
<i>Drawn out and excruciating.</i>

601
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,886
I don't want to disappoint you.

602
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,430
That's not how I'm gonna die.

603
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,349
Well, we'll see.

604
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,309
Will we?

605
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,769
[beeps]

606
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,363
[intense music continues]

607
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,208
[music stops, Mark sighs]

608
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,259
I've been thinking about the nomination.

609
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,972
You should go with Abruzzo.

610
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,108
We could get beaten up in the midterms

611
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,777
if the wrong signals are sent.

612
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,700
It's the way to be a two-term president.

613
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,412
There's still a lot we can accomplish.

614
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,583
You're such a strange animal.

615
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,922
You've never been comfortable in your skin
since you've been vice president.

616
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,799
Why did you even try?

617
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,722
I believe in you.

618
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,517
Well, that's not enough.

619
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,647
I'll leave you to your movie then.

620
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,817
What does Annette have to say
about all this?

621
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,281
- I know you're close to her.
- I won't betray her.

622
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,577
Just like I won't betray you, Claire.

623
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,788
They got us, you know?

624
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,933
We should make the announcement.

625
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,727
Abruzzo.

626
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,619
You can start the film.

627
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:27,305
[“Lullaby” by Krzysztof Komeda plays,

631
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,583
looking for memos.

632
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,520
Hard disks have been scrubbed,
and there's nothing in the cloud.

633
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,921
There's no paper trail,
virtual or otherwise.

634
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,010
- Skorsky?
- [Seth] She was with the <i>Herald.</i>

635
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,678
She left when I joined the White House.

636
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,930
It's just a local paper.
We can acquire it.

637
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,391
This isn't about
the president grandstanding.

638
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,393
She's talking to someone.

639
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,314
- Duncan...
- We should save the app for the midterms.

640
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,192
Well, do you trust
what you've built or not?

641
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,485
I don't want it exposed.

642
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,070
She signed up for the app.

643
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,489
We can get into her phone,
take a look around.

644
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,823
[Annette clears throat]

645
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,284
Would you gentlemen excuse us?

646
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,870
No, stay. Bill.

647
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,296
She wants to see me.

648
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,300
Uh-uh. Nope.

649
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,388
She says Mark is no longer
a viable vice president.

650
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,390
He's not communicating her wishes.

651
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,142
She wants to deal directly with me.

652
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,646
She's in no position to demand anything.

653
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,944
My God.

654
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,196
You want to meet with her.

655
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,407
She's still the president.

656
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,784
Who had three abortions,

657
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,453
lied to the American people about one.

658
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,831
I told you, I'm not willing to use that.

659
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,877
Then you'll use the other thing.

660
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,089
What Mark told us.

661
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,345
Seal. The case was pretty typical.

662
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,847
Prep school drugs.

663
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,976
Duncan Shepherd was rich enough
to get off, but the other boy,

664
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,436
not so lucky.

665
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,353
But...

666
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,647
the transcript.

667
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,901
- Hmm. Fascinating read.
- Painful, really.

669
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,823

[Claire] Oh, please send her in.

671
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,079
- Annette.
- Claire.

672
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,207
- Jane.
- Annette.

673
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,711
I'm honored we've graduated
to a first name basis.

674
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,588
Surnames can be a burden.

675
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,839
That's funny.

676
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,008
I've always loved mine.

677
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,844
What about you, Claire? You gave yours up.

678
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,970
Exactly.

679
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,097
[Jane] You feel more like an Underwood?

680
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,601
Well, like you said.
Surnames can be a burden.

681
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,895
[laughs] I like your...

682
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,813

684
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,278
That's right. From <i>The Second Sex?</i>
Remember that class, Annette?

685
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
How strange it was, as a teenager,

686
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,409
to be taught feminism by a man in French.

687
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,036
I hated that book.

688
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,996
[Jane] Long-winded, for sure.

689
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,998
But you gotta admit.

690
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,125
She was right about everything.

691
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,673

Work with me.

693
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,139
Directly, without a middleman.

694
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,557
What use is Mark,

695
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,267
if he can't be effective?

696
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,810
Mark can be very effective.

697
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,230
Well, but both sides are unhappy.

698
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,106
The Supreme Court.

699
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,900
This is a choice

700
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,319
that outlives any presidency.

701
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,612
Exactly.

702
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,282
But also part
of what defines a presidency.

703
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,534
Of course.

704
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,619
So I can't be...

705
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,415
I will consider any informed opinion.

706
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,919
But I... You understand.

707
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,589
The decision has to be mine, Annie.

708
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,135
No one calls me that anymore.

709
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,222
Your son, how old is he now?

710
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,227
Twenty-seven? No...

711
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,772
Twenty-eight. I always seem
to make him a year younger.

712
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,857
He always did look young for his age.

713
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,986
Especially his juvenile mugshot.

714
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,238
Such a baby face.

715
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,575
So, you'll speak to Bill?

716
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,662
I don't need to.

717
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,666
You're the president.
You should do what you want.

718
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,544
That's what I keep thinking.

719
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,839
Do you remember how much fun
we used to have,

720
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,550
before we understood the rules?

721
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,474
[door opens and closes]

722
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,052
[Claire coughs]

723
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,270
Look, let's not let it all
break down here, okay?

724
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,480
Correct me if I'm wrong,

725
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,167
but you've never had a foothold like this
in the White House. So...

726
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,568
You want to save her or fuck her?

727
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,655
- Either way, do it on your time.
- Don't make it personal.

728
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,908
[scoffs] Don't insult me.

729
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,704
Shut her down.

730
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,622
Show it to her.

731
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,793
That's what Bill and I want.
And you'll do it.

732
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,126
No.

733
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,383
- I'm not asking.
- The fallout from that...

734
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,384
Not my concern.

735
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,260
It will be your concern.

736
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,262
[Annette sighs]

737
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,478
You're on your own now.

738
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,940
- Oh, no, no, we're done.
- Don't.

739
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,776
Annette.

740
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,492
<i>The reign of the middle-aged white man
is over.</i>

741
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,578
<i>The Bill Shepherds of the world
who won't let go,</i>

742
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,871
<i>have to go.</i>

743
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,542
The waitress who filmed it works
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

744
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,170
They were hoping to use the clip when
it came to Judge Abruzzo's confirmation.

745
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,173
Okay, thank you.

746
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,260
Have you heard from Tom Yates, Kelsey?

747
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,096
No. Uh...

748
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,764
You were friendly with him, right?

749
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,476
I haven't heard from Tom in a long time.

750
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,896
And your coworkers,
have they asked about him at all?

751
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,314
Now and then.

752
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,024
He used to roam around down there.

753
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,609
Everyone liked him.

754
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,881
Well, I had my national security team
look into it. And they tracked him down.

755
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,826
It seems he's been using his credit card
in and around Prague, apparently.

756
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,578
I'm glad to hear it.

757
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,248
No, because I was worried.

758
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,668
We used to talk a lot,
and then it just stopped.

759
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,297
Did you ever read anything
he was working on...

760
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,467
- [phone vibrating]
- ...besides the speeches he wrote for me?

761
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,177
No, just the early stuff.

762
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,970
Cathy.

763
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,765
Oh, Stan.

764
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,185
Oh, my God.

765
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,288
That's all for now. When did it happen?

766
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,985
I'm so, so sorry.

767
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,407
No, the last conversation I had with her,
she was talking about her new job

768
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,411
and what a great opportunity
it was going to be.

769
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,551
[car driving]

770
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,975
[tires screech, crash]

771
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,321
[inhales]

772
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,665
[telephone ringing]

773
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,384
Madam President.

774
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,053
[Claire] <i>Forgive me for calling so late.</i>

775
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,265
<i>I've just been informed...</i>

776
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,184
<i>that Catherine Durant is dead.</i>

777
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,273
It's an embolism, they're saying.
Connected to her fall.

778
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,737
I want to thank you, Doug,
so much for your help.

779
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,620
[Doug] It's a shame.

780
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,665
It's a terrible shame.

781
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,376
[Claire] <i>Yes...</i>

782
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,880
<i>a terrible, terrible shame.</i>

783
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,632
She will be missed.

784
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,313
[chattering]

785
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,707
[panting]

786
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,316
[Claire] Mark.

787
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,486
Apologies for disturbing your run.

788
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,403
What's happened?

789
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,247
- Can we have a word in private?
- Of course.

790
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,824
[Mark] It's okay, Steve.
My detail cleared the area.

791
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,886
- [man] Clear.
- [man 2] Okay, we're clear.

792
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,030
[Claire] Where are we going?

793
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,677
[Mark] You have 20 seconds.

794
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,056
I can get rid of this,
or the cops will find him.

795
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,064
You've run out of options,
Madam President.

796
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,986
I understand.
