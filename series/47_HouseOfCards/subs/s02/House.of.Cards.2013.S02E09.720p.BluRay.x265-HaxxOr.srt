3
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,180
Hey, Freddy.
How you doing?

4
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,349
All right.
That's what I like to hear.

5
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,684
Not bad .

6
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,895
I spoke to
everyone I know at the Daffy.

7
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,268
Nobody's naming sources,
but it has to be Remy.

8
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,863
Is Galloway going
on the record?

9
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,035
He wouldn't. Not without
speaking to us first.

10
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,272
Well, let's be sure about that.
I'll talk lo Adam.

11
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,005
Maybe it's smarter
to avoid contact.

12
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,709
Well, somebody has to respond.
Whether it's him or us or both.

13
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,615
Well, we have to coordinate and
we have to do it carefully.

14
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,617
Let me take care of this. Well,
let's just think this through.

15
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,713
I've got it
covered, Francis.

16
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,360
Okay. Now what
should I do?

17
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,589
Head back to the office? I
think you should work here.

18
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,926
We can't avoid the
press if you leave.

19
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,695
All right. You hold down the fort.
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,100
And you follow Claire's lead.
We'll shut this down, sir.

21
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,568
There can't be any doubt.

22
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,038
Let's walk through a timeline.
So you first met him when?

23
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,130
The Whitney Biennial...

24
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,768
This hurts us both, but it's
not my wound to suture.

25
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,246
Claire must be the surgeon.
Only she can stop the bleeding.

26
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,214
We got them
plates in there.

27
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,913
TOMMY: All right, all
the changes you asked for.

28
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,753
Give you five more points
on the post-recoupment share.

29
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,815
Approval over all
the marketing materials.

30
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,795
Approval over the staff hires for
the flagship in Silver Spring.

31
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,094
So what next?
You sign.

32
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,660
And I get my 95,000.
By the end of the week.

33
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,398
Just have to wire it from our
main account into the LLC,

34
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,805
cut a cashier's check for you.

35
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,302
Oh, I want
to show you this.

36
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,311
It's a mock-up
of the bottle design.

37
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,904
And we already started

38
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,612
on the concept layouts for
the Silver Spring location.

39
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,783
Why is that linoleum
peeling up?

40
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,294
You know, make
it seem real.

41
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,455
Well, I wanted it to
look nicer than this.

42
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,157
We can scratch
the peeling linoleum,

43
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,598
but we don't want it
to look too nice.

44
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,002
You want them white folks
to feel like they slummin'.

45
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,504
To have an authentic
atmosphere.

46
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,871
And I get to
play the nigger.

47
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,966
Look, Freddy,
you know how this works.

48
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,309
They don't just want the ribs.
They want the experience.

49
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,541
But without having
to leave the suburbs for it.

50
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,317
We're not selling
candlelit dinners here.

51
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,980
But I promise nothing gets built
without your signing off.

52
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,156

53
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,691
<i>So what do you
want me to do?</i>

54
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,402
<i>I need you to deny it.
The affair?</i>

55
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,998
The affair, taking the
photograph, everything.

56
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,543
<i>We have</i> a <i>public history.</i>

57
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,836
I donated work for your...

58
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,141
<i>You can say we had
a business relationship,</i>

59
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,708
but that you didn't take
the picture of me in the bed.

60
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,687
It was photoshopped. Whatever
it is you need to say.

61
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,018
<i>I'm so sorry, Claire.</i>

62
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,023
I only have one print.
And ifs still here.

63
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,427
<i>You have to destroy it.
The digital file also.</i>

64
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,192
<i>But e-mail us a copy first.
Why'?</i>

65
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,331
We need to make sure that
there's nothing in the image

66
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,199
that links to your studio.

67
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,172
<i>Whatever you think is best.</i>

68
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,263
Thank you, Adam.

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,676
I watched you when you
did the CNN interview.

70
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,943
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't,
but I couldn't help it.</i>

71
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,356
<i>It's a shame it takes this for
us to talkie one another.</i>

72
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,789
You're well,
besides this?

73
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,195
<i>Yeah. I spent three
months in Colombia</i>

74
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,031
<i>after you came up here,
to work, but also get away.</i>

75
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,934
<i>I</i> met someone.

76
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:08,929
Oh.

77
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,806
<i>She's from Bogota. She was
working with an NGO there.</i>

78
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,972
<i>Her name's Inez. And she's
living with me now.</i>

79
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,109
Wow! That...
Things happened quickly.

80
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,881
<i>Yeah. They did.</i>

81
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,889
I should go.

82
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,652
So I won't talk to
the press till I get instructions.

83
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,162
<i>That's right.</i>

84
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,660
It's good to
hear your voice.

85
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,968
You, too.

86
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,274
You finished?
Yeah.

87
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,695
Smack, crack, blow.
No, thanks.

88
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,705
Come on, old man.
We got what you need.

89
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,867
I don't need anything.

90
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,774
You gotta buy something
if you want to get inside.

91
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,845
Get out the way.

92
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,872
What?
For real.

93
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,278
You need to get the
fuck on outta my way.

94
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,455
Just fucking
with you, nigger.

95
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,216
Chill the fuck out.

96
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,389

97
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,906
Who are you?

98
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,477
Your grandfather. Open up.

99
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,185
<i>What's your plan?
</i> Work <i>from home.</i>

100
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,722
You don't need me dragging this
circus to the White House.

101
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,984
<i>I mean in terms
of a statement.</i>

102
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,754
We're drafting one.
Short and sweet.

103
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,361
<i>Forgive me, Frank, but you know !
have to ask...</i>

104
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,694
If it were true,
I would tell you, sir.

105
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,892
<i>Would you like me to go on record?
Say I stand beside...</i>

106
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,026
No, no, no. I appreciate
that, Mr. President,

107
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,504
but you shouldn't dirty your
hands with this sort of garbage.

108
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
If the press corners you,

109
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,768
just tell 'em you don't engage in
this sort of gossip-mongering.

110
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,110
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway is
about to appear on television.

111
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,877
<i>Go. Let me know if there's anything I
can do.</i>

112
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,782
Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,514
<i>Good afternoon.
I have very little to say.</i>

114
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,121
<i>Only that I never had
any romantic involvement</i>

115
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,783
<i>with Claire Underwood</i>

116
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,054
<i>and that I did not
take the photograph</i>

117
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,858
<i>printed in the D.C. Daily.</i>

118
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,899
<i>I'm sorry that the Vice
President and his wife</i>

119
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,127
<i>have to go through
this ridiculous ordeal.</i>

120
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:55,070
<i>And I would ask that the media leave
both my fiancée and me out of it.</i>

121
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,402
<i>Thank you.</i>

122
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,467
You'll be
ready in an hour'?

123
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,102
Yes. We'll be ready.

124
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,908
Uh, you might want to change
into something more...

125
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,971
Conservative'?
Uh, yes.

126
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,880
I'm gonna go throw
the hounds a bone.

127
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,148
I know it's demeaning...
Not another word.

128
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,757
I should have been
more careful.

129
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,059
We'll put this behind us,
just like we've always done.

130
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,396
Part of me wishes...
What?

131
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,403
That you'd
be more upset.

132
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,138
Tusk came after you
because of me.

133
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,475
It's you who
should be upset.

134
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,853
Wasted energy, isn't it?
For both of us.

135
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,349
Shall we rehearse?

136
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,126
I don't need your help.

137
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,360
This ain't a handout. You have
to pay me back over time.

138
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,029
Work for it.
Work for you?

139
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,705
I'm gonna get the
house either way.

140
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,605
Whether you choose to
live in it is up to you.

141
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,110
Yeah, just what I need.

142
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,646
You in the easy chair
laying into me

143
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,009
every time I come
in and out the door.

144
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,639
The place is for you
and DeShawn.

145
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,513
I'm gonna be
in my own apartment

146
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,655
You sure this nigger ain't
just selling you smoke?

147
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,783
Says it right in the contract.
Ninety-five Gs no matter what.

148
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,794
I don't know, man.

149
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,858
Five years I don't see you, then
you come knocking on the door

150
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,731
and talking about you got 95 Gs...
Your choice.

151
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,735
You didn't want me to
visit you no more in jail

152
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,204
and you sure didn't want
to see me after you...

153
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,800
I still don't want to see you.
Well, here I am.

154
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,334
Get the fuck outta
here, old man.

155
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,347
You listen to me, boy.

156
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,182
I never had nothin'
to give you.

157
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,721
I didn't have no money.

158
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,552
And you didn't want
whatever I had.

159
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,523
But we talking
about a house.

160
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,694
DeShawn deserves to live better
than in a place like this...

161
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,858
This ain't about him.
It's about you.

162
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,169
You know where to find me.

163
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,269
See you, kid.

164
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,210
 Less than 30 minutes.
 Are they going to deny?

165
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,876
I'm gonna let the Vice President
and his wife speak for themselves.

166
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,419
 Have they been
in contact with Mr. Galloway?

167
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,543
No, they haven't.

168
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,749
Why has it taken them
almost a full day to respond?

169
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,913
I'm sure you can understand

170
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,549
they wanted to consult
with legal counsel first,

171
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,889
regarding defamation
and slander.

172
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,054
So you're saying
they will deny the affair?

173
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,722
I'm saying they'll be
out here in 30 minutes,

174
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,732
and you can quote
them instead of me.

175
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,892
Thank you all very much
for your patience.

176
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,795
I hate this.
What? Waiting?

177
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:45,399
No, the affair. It's bullshit.
I feel like a tabloid hack.

178
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,639
You'd rather be stuck at
the White House all day?

179
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,213
Fuck this.

180
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,944
Where are you going?

181
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,315
To do something
meaningful with my time.

182
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,490
Hey, I need you to book me
a flight to St. Louis.

183
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,754
Tonight, if you can
find something.

184
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,900
No Q&A, so don't even try.
Behave yourselves, people.

185
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:27,180
I find it very painful
that anyone would suggest

186
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,847
I'm capable of being unfaithful to
my husband, whom I love dearly.

187
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,117
<i>I've known Adam Galloway
for years, We both have.</i>

188
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,992
<i>When Iran the
Clean Water Initiative,</i>

189
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,292
<i>I commissioned him
to do a series of photographs</i>

190
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,355
<i>for the marketing campaign.</i>

191
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,095
And he was
extremely generous

192
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,263
by donating work for
our fundraising auctions.

193
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,372
So I'm not sure why he would
deny taking the photograph.

194
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,012
<i>I love Adam's work. So I asked
him to take this portrait.</i>

195
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:03,514
We did it here, at the house.
Francis was there during the shoot.

196
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,145
It was a birthday present.

197
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,350
Claire asked me what sort
of portrait I wanted,

198
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,222
and I said I want
one of her sleeping.

199
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,653
<i>Because she's so very beautiful
when she's steeping.</i>

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,529
<i>It hangs in my office
on the second ﬂoor.</i>

201
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,725
They're fucking lying.

202
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,404
<i>So I can only assume
that Adam was intimidated</i>

203
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,132
<i>by the media attention</i>

204
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>and he needed
to distance himself.</i>

205
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,510
What?

206
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,874
<i>But really, all we have here</i>

207
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,880
<i>is a very talented photographer
and a prized possession.</i>

208
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,015
<i>Thank you all very much.
Thank you.</i>

209
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,252
Because it would have seemed too
clean otherwise, like we...

210
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,654
You made me look
<i>like an</i> idiot.

211
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,692
If we had
the same story,

212
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,595
the media would assume
we were coordinating.

213
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,257
It needed to look messier.

214
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,527
<i>This was supposed
to go away, Claire.</i>

215
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,366
I've got twice as much press
outside the building now.

216
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,700
<i>Adam...</i>

217
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:55,865
I've gotta keep
the lights off

218
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,670
'cause they're on the roof across the
street, trying to film us inside.

219
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,907
You just need to confirm that
you took the photo for us.

220
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,107
Confirm our version.

221
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,615
Say you lied
because you were scared.

222
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,208
I don't know why
you didn't just tell me

223
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,753
this is what you
were intending to do.

224
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,878
<i>Because I know you,
and you would have refused.</i>

225
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,582
<i>You have too much pride.</i>

226
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,292
I don't want to speak
to the press again.

227
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,230
<i>Listen, if you say nothing, they're
not going to leave you alone.</i>

228
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,097
<i>They will just camp out
for weeks on end...</i>

229
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,466
This is...
It feels wrong, Claire.

230
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,900
<i>It feels. ,.</i>

231
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,201
I'm sorry I lied.

232
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,040
<i>I wasn't trying
to be manipulative.</i>

233
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,475
I have to go.

234
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,147
Adam? Adam'?

235
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,651
I think he'll do
the right thing.

236
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,114
I don't know.
I hope so.

237
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,324
Cigarette?

238
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,997
No. I'm gonna turn in.
Wake me if he goes on TV.

239
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,441
Doug, why don't you
and Seth come over?

240
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,779
Should we consider
a lawsuit against the paper?

241
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,982
Show we won't tolerate
this son of gossip?

242
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,182
They won't settle.

243
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,657
They'll fight it in the courts
because it'll generate more news.

244
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,750
And what about the President?
He offered to say something.

245
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,921
Draws more attention.

246
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,191
The President
isn't a bad idea,

247
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,629
if we phrase his
statement for him.

248
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,964
He becomes the headline, and we
can't control his press operation.

249
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,461
But if we coordinate
with them, it shouldn't...

250
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,765
 Coordination
looks bad.

251
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,869
So it's your job
to conceal it.

252
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,964
If Seth doesn't think the
President should make a comment,

253
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,135
then we should
defer to his judgment.

254
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,303
I'm gonna get
another beer.

255
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,471
I can go grab
you one, sir.

256
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,536
No, no. I feel like
stretching my legs.

257
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,377
Doug? Diet Coke?
I'm fine. Thank you, sir.

258
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,712
Seth? Beer? I have to
drive, but thanks.

259
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,047
I'll be right back.

260
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,060
Watch yourself.
What do you mean?

261
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,190
Connor was an easy target,
but I'm not going anywhere.

262
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,962
Look, Doug, I'm grateful
just to be here...

263
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,233
You think I've survived with the Vice
President so long by being blind?

264
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,407
Upward mobility has a ceiling
with the Underwoods.

265
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,743
I'm the ceiling.
Understood.

266
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,579
What else have you
got on them?

267
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,409
Nothing.

268
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,985
You fork over the journal without
a backup plan for a rainy day?

269
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,180
I don't think so.

270
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,349
I had one hand and I played it.
I don't press my luck.

271
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,222
You can't expect me to believe you.
I don't.

272
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,430
I wouldn't if I were you,
but I'm telling the truth.

273
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,733
A little sibling rivalry
isn't such a bad thing,

274
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,896
especially between
adopted boys.

275
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,838
They either push each other to be
the best versions of themselves

276
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,207
or one of them gets booted
back to the orphanage.

277
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,545
You're in my house,
you drink if I drink.

278
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,017
One Diet Coke for you,
and one beer for you.

279
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,212
Thank you, sir.

280
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,913
Oh, darling,
what a mess.

281
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,890
Sweetheart.

282
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,360
How are you holding up?

283
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,897
The press have been
harassing us the past two days.

284
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,456
Yeah, we barely made it out of
the building without being trampled.

285
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,932
How awful.

286
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,198
You said someone was here to see me.
He's in my office.

287
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,696
Did he tell you
who he was?

288
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,707
I didn't want to say over the phone.
You never know these days.

289
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,403
He says he used to work
for the Underwoods.

290
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,720
Who?
Your assistant.

291
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,916
No, she would never...
She would and she did.

292
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,322
Why are you doing this? It's not
me, but the man I work for.

293
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,259
And who is that?
It doesn't concern you.

294
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,127
This is my life
you're fucking with.

295
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,756
You and I are just
pawns, Mr. Galloway.

296
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,160
You should leave.

297
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,397
We need more. To prove
the affair happened.

298
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,496
Another photograph.

299
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,767
Thirty seconds, you
better be out the door.

300
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,935
I'm not going anywhere.

301
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,575
You recognize
the country code?

302
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,077
And the city
code is Bogota.

303
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,185
Is it still ringing?

304
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,457
Marshall!

305
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,690
Hey, Pops.

306
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,504
Man, never seen it like this before.
That line's down the block.

307
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,470
Something else, ain't it?

308
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,168
Looks like you could
use some help.

309
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,841
Got an extra apron
in the back.

310
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,486
<i>She refuses to leave the lobby.</i>

311
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,687
What's her name?

312
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,993
Ayla Sayyad,
Wall Street Telegraph.

313
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,035
<i>She's part of the Vice
President's press corps.</i>

314
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,067
Oh,yeah.

315
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,563
Send her up.

316
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,839
I appreciate it, Tricia,
but I'm fine.

317
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,244
This whole thing will blow over
in a day or so. And I'll...

318
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,975
Can you hold one second?

319
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,177
The Daily. They called
for a comment.

320
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,878
Did Adam speak
with them?

321
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,521
Yes, but not what
we told them to say.

322
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,215
He sent them this.

323
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,227
Tricia, can I
call you back?

324
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,726
Is that you?
No.

325
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,260
Because he's
saying it is.

326
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,070
It might be.
Mrs. Underwood...

327
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:31,403
I mean, it could be, yes.
It probably is.

328
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,068
I asked you about
any vulnerabilities.

329
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,949
I didn't know
he took this.

330
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,882
You have short hair
in the picture.

331
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,285
You said it ended
over two years ago.

332
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,391
Well, I visited
him last fall.

333
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,789
Does anyone else know?
Did anyone see you there?

334
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,361
He had friends over
to his apartment.

335
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,394
Christ.

336
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,090
But we've said
that he's a friend.

337
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,363
There's nothing wrong with me
visiting him, being at a party.

338
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,701
There is if this photo is on
the front page of the Daily.

339
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,374
Politics and business are intertwined
in China, as I'm sure you know.

340
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,075
It's not uncommon
to partner with someone

341
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,949
who can ensure
Beijing's approval.

342
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,749
So you needed his
political influence.

343
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,792
All this is moot.
Our venture fell through.

344
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,122
Right after the Port Jefferson
Bridge was approved.

345
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,294
Well, I had nothing to
do with that project.

346
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,059
Neither did Feng,
to my knowledge.

347
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,264
No. But Wu Bin Yang did. He's
Feng's biggest rival in Beijing.

348
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,838
Well, looks like I shouldn't be
schooling you on Chinese politics.

349
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,402
You know far more than I.

350
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,072
You used the word
"intertwined."

351
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,747
That's the sense I'm
getting from all of this.

352
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,118
The samarium subsidy, the
Chinese refinery, the bridge.

353
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,178
your friendship
with the President...

354
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,757
Who sent you?

355
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,482
Who sent me?

356
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,655
When you're as rich as I am,
you're always a target.

357
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,356
Nobody sent me.

358
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,866
You're here in St. Louis.

359
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,862
Instead of covering the Vice
President and his wife.

360
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,965
My gut says there's more to Xander
Feng than has been reported.

361
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,169
Yeah, Yeah.

362
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,806
It's a far better
use of my time

363
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,313
than reporting on
tabloid sex scandals.

364
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,210
That's not real news.

365
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,381
You miss Tehran.

366
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,882
I read some of your work while
you were in the waiting area.

367
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,051
It started to get
too dangerous.

368
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,692
Phew! Yeah.

369
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,819
Not the best
place to be

370
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,694
when you want to get married
and start a family.

371
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,398
Or if you're Jewish.
That, too.

372
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,065
My wife got this for me
when she visited there,

373
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,005
before the revolution.

374
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,544
It's beautiful.
16th century.

375
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:53,345
It broke when it was being
shipped, into 1,000 pieces.

376
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:59,083
It took specialists over
a year to restore it.

377
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,184
Here. I want
you to have it.

378
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,556
I can't accept gifts.

379
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,925
No, no, no.
Not as a gift. No.

380
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,692
As a reminder of
how hard it can be

381
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:12,564
to put something back together
again once it's been crushed.

382
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,231
If you're going
to threaten me,

383
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,705
you don't have to go to the
trouble of veiling it.

384
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,337
I don't usually do
interviews with reporters.

385
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,005
They're parasites.

386
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,609
Usually interested in just finding
a way to knock me down a peg.

387
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,579
Invariably, what they
write is inaccurate.

388
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:37,354
And when that happens, I have
no choice but to retaliate.

389
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:46,230
America can be just as
dangerous as Iran, Ms. Sayyad.

390
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,106
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Tusk.

391
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,139
Travel safe back
to Washington.

392
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,122
Get Remy on the line.

393
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,164
BETTY: Remy's on line two.

394
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,294
Remy, let's not hold back
on the other thing.

395
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,168
Hit 'em again
and hit 'em now.

396
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,576
Best day yet.

397
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,771
You gotta get a safe
or something.

398
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,610
Or maybe one of those
pickup services.

399
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,343
That's too much money to be
carrying around at night.

400
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,941
I can handle
it myself.

401
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,749
Hey, ain't nobody can handle
a Glock to the face.

402
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,313
Unless you got
one yourself.

403
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,450
My days of packing
are long gone.

404
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,693
Here. Take mine.

405
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,666
I got one at home.

406
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,867
What the fuck you doing
bringing that thing in here?

407
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,804
Yo, it's just
for protection, man.

408
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,943
I don't know what you're
doing with it anyway.

409
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,342
What about your parole?

410
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,969
I'm a lot more worried
about niggers in my building

411
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,878
than some parole officer.

412
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,506
All right, sit down.
See, man, this is...

413
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,312
This is what I'm
talking about, man.

414
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,944
You being all righteous
and judging me and shit.

415
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,718
Do me a favor and just sit down.
Sit down now!

416
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:29,833
Look, we got us a good
thing, potentially.

417
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,507
Maybe nothing comes of it,
but maybe something does.

418
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,911
If the joint works out, maybe one
day you could be the manager.

419
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,882
Shit, if it blows up, you could
run the whole fucking franchise.

420
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,354
But that means
you gotta be careful.

421
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,756
That means you cannot
be sent back inside.

422
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,588
We gotta follow the rules.

423
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Hear me?

424
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:57,592
All right.

425
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,062
You gonna get rid
of that thing.

426
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,030
Yeah.

427
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,938
All right. Now, that's
what's being a man.

428
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,851
I'll need you to cut it.

429
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,513
How short?

430
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,723
This short.

431
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,227
I have a modeling career.
If I cut it that short...

432
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,922
If you actually
had a modeling career,

433
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,397
I would be speaking
to your agency

434
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,526
and not sitting
in your apartment

435
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,400
You want this
job or not?

436
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,066
Okay, yeah.
I can cut it.

437
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,109
All right.

438
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:44,580
Before we go to the studio, I need
to see how well-spoken you are.

439
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,775
Why does that matter?

440
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:50,911
Because you're gonna be on
every news channel in America.

441
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,149
Wait. What's
this for?

442
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,720
Read this.
Those exact words.

443
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,464
Read 'em. If you're good,
you'll memorize them.

444
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,596
My name is Stephanie Daldry.

445
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,339
I am a professional model.

446
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,107
"Freddy Hayes
was convicted in 1982

447
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:20,616
"for sticking up a convenience
store in Columbia Heights.

448
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,946
"During a high-speed pursuit,

449
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,954
"Hayes lost control and
crashed into another vehicle,

450
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,081
"killing an elderly couple.

451
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,523
"He avoided
manslaughter charges

452
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,958
"by pleading guilty

453
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,290
"He served nine years.

00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,804
"frequented by Vice President
Frank Underwood.“

457
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,209
Did you know?
No, I didn't.

458
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,211
You think it's Tusk?
Who else?

459
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,951
Who are you texting?
Seth.

460
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,617

461
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,127
 All I want to do
is make a short statement.

462
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,823
Freddy did his time.

463
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,798
He's been an upstanding
citizen for 20 years.

464
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,463
He's a convicted felon who
killed two senior citizens.

465
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,506
By accident. Well,
that's beside the point.

466
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,473
I am not gonna
hang him out to dry.

467
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,568
If the Galloway story wasn't
happening, I'd say it's fine.

468
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,080
But it's too risky right now.
Think of how this is shaping up.

469
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,979
A vice president whose
wife cheats on him

470
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,986
and who is friendly with
a former gang-banger?

471
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,215
There is no way you win
standing up for this guy.

472
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,690
He's about
to start a franchise.

473
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,692
I will not have it jeopardized
because Tusk decides...

474
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,752
It's more than just Freddy, sir.
I did some digging.

475
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,230
His son did time for narcotics,
trafficking, distribution...

476
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,596
I've never met his son.

477
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,101
Let's hold off
and tackle one...

478
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,501
No. I want you to organize a
press avail tomorrow morning.

479
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,403
Have Freddy brought over here.
Bring him to the back.

480
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,496
Yes, sir.

481
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,113
I won't leave one of my own
bleeding on the field.

482
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,456
If you gonna have the
Washington Redskins, then you...

483
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,623
Pops, it ain't that deep.

484
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,456
Back off, man. Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Back the fuck off.

485
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,554
Darnell, just ignore them.

486
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,362
You think I'm fucking around here?
Darnell, ignore it.

487
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,860
Ignore 'em.

488
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,403
They can't take our pictures
if we don't want them to.

489
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,802
Sure as hell can.

490
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,635
What'd you say? It's
the First fucking Amendment

491
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,735
You gonna read me the
Constitution now, motherfucker?

492
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,402
Come on, Darnell.
Let's just go on inside.

493
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,140
No, I ain't clone with this asshole.
Hey, don't touch me.

494
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,613
Oh, but you can get all up in my
face, but I can't get up in yours?

495
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,308
Just listen to your daddy...
Darnell, let's go.

496
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,443
Don't push me.
I will fuck you up.

497
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,885
You think I'm scared of you?
You scared of this?

498
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,988
Darnell! Parole!

499
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,147

500
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,761
 <i>Can you tell me
your name, please?</i>

501
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,095
<i>Stephanie Daldry.
I'm a professional model.</i>

502
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,967
<i>And this is you in
this photo on the right?</i>

503
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,163
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

504
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,139
<i>We shot this photo yesterday
with Ms. Daldry.</i>

505
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,307
<i>So you're suggesting that
Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?</i>

506
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,678
<i>Well, I don't know anything
about professional photography.</i>

507
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,772
<i>I'm just a flack.</i>

508
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,318
<i>But if we can create a fake
in less than 24 hours,</i>

509
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,287
<i>I think an expert photographer
like Adam Galloway...</i>

510
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,822
<i>Those are
serious allegations,</i>

511
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,359
<i>especially given that Mr. Galloway
vehemently denies it.</i>

512
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,292
<i>Well, I'm not surprised
he's denying.</i>

513
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,797
<i>Ultimately, though, it's gonna
be your word against his.</i>

514
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,264
<i>Oh, not my word.</i>

515
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,958
<i>The Vice President
of the United States.</i>

516
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,629
<i>It's his word versus that of
a potentially troubled man.</i>

517
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,366
<i>Troubled?
Potentially.</i>

518
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,338
<i>Or maybe he has a motive.</i>

519
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,435
<i>What motive could Mr. Galloway
possibly have for a fake photo?</i>

520
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,447
<i>What</i> would he get out of it?
 I don't know.

521
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,609
<i>My job is to separate fact from
fiction, just like yours is, Candy.</i>

522
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,516
<i>But maybe fact and fiction</i>

523
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,952
<i>don't matter as much
to the artistic sensibility.</i>

524
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,820
<i>Maybe the lines
are blurred for him.</i>

525
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,156
<i>This is not a man who stages
fictitious scenarios.</i>

526
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,026
<i>Well, like I said, the an
stuff, it's over my head.</i>

527
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,154
<i>And you may be right.</i>

528
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,166
<i>But I would hate to think
that Mr. Galloway</i>

529
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,202
<i>was doing this
just for publicity.</i>

530
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,894
<i>You think it's a publicity stunt.</i>

531
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,369
Come on in.

532
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,634
Sir?
ls Freddy on his way?

533
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,834
There was an incident
with his son.

534
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,137
<i>I look at those photos...</i>

535
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,200
What happened?

536
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,179
He's in custody for threatening
a photographer with a firearm.

537
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,684
Jesus. Where's
Freddy now?

538
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,846
He's at home.
I have to go see him.

539
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,252
That's the projects, sir. I don't care.
You figure it out.

540
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,256
And the press can't know.
Yes, sir.

541
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,928
Francis, you know I love Freddy.
I'm going.

542
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,330
Freddy is dangerous because
you care too much.

543
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,063
When we care too
much, it blinds us.

544
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,104
What Tusk did is cheap.

545
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,537
And you're letting it get to you,
which is exactly what he wants.

546
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,872
If I just ignore this,
if I do nothing...

547
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,276
It's not nothing. Staying
focused requires strength.

548
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,582
You want me
to make something?

549
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,684
You go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

550
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,457
You should eat.

551
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,122
I'm sorry. You
didn't ask for this.

552
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,564
It's not fair to you.

553
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:10,437
All I want is to be done with it
and my father to be all right.

554
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,237
If I thought there was
any other way that...

555
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:16,245
I didn't want to take the chance...
I know.

556
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:21,746
God, these people. I always
knew they were ruthless.

557
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,753
We're caged up in here
like animals.

558
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,619
They're painting me
as some sort...

559
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,952
And your family.

560
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,084
It's inhuman.

561
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,457
They're fucking inhuman.

562
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,464
Getting worked up isn't
going to change anything.

563
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,156

564
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,563
Let me.

565
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,633
Hello?

566
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:00,846

567
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,804
Hey, Frank.

568
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,604
I'm fine.

569
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,541
Thanks for dropping by.

570
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,375
How you holding up?
Been better.

571
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,144
I ain't never seen you
without a suit before.

572
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,847
We didn't want to draw
too much attention.

573
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,015
Well, this is it.
My castle.

574
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,185
Ain't as big as yours,
but it'll do the job.

575
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,728
Blind Willie.

576
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,226
Are you a blues fan?

577
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,961
Dark Was The <i>Night</i>
gets me every time.

578
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,834
Man, you should've
told me that years ago.

579
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:52,501
I can jam talkin' about
some blues all day long.

580
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,874
Check this out.
Original 78.

581
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,170
You want something?
Water? Iced tea?

582
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,580
I'd like some iced tea,
thank you.

583
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,013
How's your son?

584
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,353
They set the bail
at 60 grand.

585
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,516
Jesus.

586
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,928
How's your wife doing?

587
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,522
Claire's got a suit of armor
three inches thick.

588
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,363
We'll get through
all this garbage.

589
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,595
Somebody's trying
to take you out.

590
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,401
Appears that way.

591
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,541
Whoever it is,
they done stepped on

592
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,736
the wrong motherfucking
rattlesnake.

593
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,215
That's why
I'm here, Freddy.

594
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,945

595
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,186
I have to distance
myself from you.

596
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,789
I need to make sure you're
not going to play up

597
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,592
what good friends
we've been.

598
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,035
That you've been to my office. That
you've cooked dinner at my home.

599
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,196
Or that the President
was there.

600
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,801
We can't drag him
into anything.

601
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,138
And I won't be coming in
for ribs anymore.

602
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,944
With all that's going on,
we can't add fuel to the fire.

603
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,287
You couldn't
if you wanted to.

604
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,658
I'm selling it.

605
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,490
Selling the joint?
That's right.

606
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,619
What are you talking about?

607
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,757
The franchise thing
with the sauce,

608
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,824
my business partner's
pulling out.

609
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,395
Say them white folks
down in Silver Spring

610
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,100
don't want to go to
no place run by thugs.

611
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,402
Well, why do you
have to sell yours?

612
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,276
Darnell's bail.

613
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,972
Well, doesn't that guy have to
give you 100 grand regardless?

614
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,411
I ain't getting shit.

615
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,743
There's a morality
clause in the contract.

616
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,653
But he's gonna pay me 45
thou for the storefront.

617
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:51,353
That with what little I got
saved, I can pay that bond.

618
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,655
You can't sell Freddy's.

619
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,592
He's already drawing
up the papers.

620
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,766
Let me help you with the money.
No, Frank.

621
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,198
We'll make it a loan.
You can pay me back.

622
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,093
Not gonna happen.
Don't be prideful.

623
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,296
Frank...
Please. Let me help you.

624
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,995
I ain't taking
your guilt money.

625
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:14,217
When I was banging, we used
to clear 60 Gs a month.

626
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,617
I seen guys shot down,
execution style.

627
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:22,450
I didn't give a shit.
And then I got caught

628
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,394
Darnell was born my first year in.
Never saw him once.

629
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,327
Not even a picture.

630
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,525
I can't take back
the bad I done.

631
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,535
All I can do is to make my own
way like I've been doing.

632
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,904
You understand?

633
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,241
Ain't pride, Frank.

634
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,434
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

635
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,268
You was a good
customer. That's it.

636
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,273
You ain't gotta pretend
to be my friend.

637
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,438
You take care
of yourself, Freddy.

638
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,508
You, too, Frank.

639
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,555
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

640
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,528
Well, you should.
I wouldn't disagree with you.

641
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,967
The road to power is paved
with hypocrisy and casualties.

642
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,476
Never regret.

643
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,270
MEECHUM; This way.

644
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,411
Have a seat, Adam.

645
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,288
You left your phone at
home, as you were asked?

646
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,954
Yeah.

647
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,466
And what did you tell
your fiancée, exactly?

648
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,093
That I'd be gone for a while.
She doesn't know where.

649
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,105
And what will she say if
someone checks in on her?

650
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,640
What is this?
What will she say?

651
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,767
Francis.

652
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,038
We need to work
together now.

653
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,135
I tried.
You lied to me.

654
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,512
And I explained to you
why that was necessary.

655
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,207
You didn't follow
my instructions.

656
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,209

657
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,346
Do you know who
Remy Danton is?

658
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,321
He approached you.

659
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,886
Inez's father is a human
rights activist in Bogota.

660
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,293
The government have charged him with
treason for working with the rebels.

661
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,495
They're going
for the death penalty,

662
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,801
and Danton said they have
the judge in their pocket.

663
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,535
You should have
come to us.

664
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,837
Well, I said I would. Danton
said you couldn't do anything.

665
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,636
He's wrong.

666
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,245
Well, l wasn't gonna
take any chances.

667
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,311
Has he done what the
government's claiming?

668
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,878
No. They're made-up charges.

669
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:38,546
He's a journalist documenting
atrocities in the Darien Gap.

670
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,986
I can get the charges dropped.
Why should I trust you?

671
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,049
Because the Secretary of State
is a good friend of mine

672
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,855
and because you don't have
any other choice.

673
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,825
We're not your chess pieces.

674
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,661
And this isn't a game,
Mr. Galloway.

675
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,565
Then why are you toying with us?
We are trying to help.

676
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,069
That's a fucking
joke' Claire.

677
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,537
Do not talk to
my wife that way.

678
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,405
Ah, your wife. What does
that even mean to you?

679
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,871
Do not mistake any
history you have shared

680
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,246
for the slightest understanding
of what our marriage is

681
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,576
or how insignificant
you are in comparison.

682
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,357
Can you give
us a few minutes?

683
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,061
I'm gonna go call Cathy.

684
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,731
Forget my career
and my reputation.

685
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,896
I want to marry
this woman, Claire.

686
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,936
We're going
to make this disappear.

687
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,873
Because of you I will always be the
man who placed her father in danger.

688
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,467
I can never erase that.

689
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm sorry it's come to this.
I'm sorry I ever met you.

690
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,413
All you've ever done
is cause me pain.

691
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,543
And you're fucking with my
life and the life of the woman

692
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,087
that I love more than
lever loved you.

693
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,916
You'll be driven back
to New York tonight.

694
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,291
In the morning,
you'll make a statement

695
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,761
saying this was
a publicity stunt.

696
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,256
And that the value of your
work had been stagnating

697
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,324
and you wanted to...

698
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,630
No, Claire, I won't do that.
Yes, you will.

699
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,330
How about I tell the press that...
Adam, shut up!

700
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,169
That you wanted attention,
then you got cold feet,

701
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,940
denied it, then you
changed your mind again.

702
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,846
And that you faked the shower
photo and you're coming clean.

703
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,682
Is that clear?
I'm not part of this world.

704
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,789
I didn't sign up for it.
I have no interest in it.

705
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,294
We're giving you
an out, Adam.

706
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,764
And if you choose
not to take it,

707
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,027
I will bury you.

708
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,705
I've never hated
anyone before.

709
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,502
Now I know what
that feels like.

710
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,014
It's a terrible
feeling, isn't it?

711
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,846

712
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,742
End call.
Call ended.

713
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,248
Call Raymond Tusk.

714
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,015
<i>No answer at his place.</i>

715
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,884
Is it a matter of more money?

716
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,514
<i>Secretary Durant has already
called President Moreno.</i>

717
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,252
So we need to move quickly.

718
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,658
<i>The minister of foreign
affairs is involved now.</i>

719
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,698
<i>The judge isn't gonna rush a
conviction in less than 12 hours.</i>

720
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,097
Well, who do we know
who has the minister's ear?

721
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,362
Nobody who can
trump President Moreno.

722
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,099
And he's very sensitive to
Durant's view on human rights.

723
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,771
Are you giving up on this?
No. Just being realistic.

724
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,002
Work on Moreno then.

725
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,368
We'll start leaving footprints.
Quiet.

726
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:51,675
Excuse me?

727
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,577
Ah, not you. My birds.

728
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,015
<i>I think we need to be
prepared for the possibility</i>

729
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,213
<i>that we can't follow through
with our threat.</i>

730
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,620
lam hearing excuses,
not solutions.

731
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:05,224
My hands are tied. I can't circumvent
the entire U.S. State Department.

732
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:07,524
<i>You know,
I hired you to destroy Frank.</i>

733
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,753
You're failing.

734
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:11,732
<i>Look, Raymond, I am your lobbyist.
Not your henchman.</i>

735
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,029
I don't employ lobbyists.

736
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,038
<i>I employ people
who can be useful to me.</i>

737
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,700
And you are proving otherwise.
Quiet now.

738
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,974
I'll figure something out.
Soon.

739
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,237

740
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,757
Okay, that's good.

741
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,261
You don't have to do this.

742
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,559
Yeah. I do.

743
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,793
The charges are dropped.

744
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,960
They lied to you.
You can lie to them.

745
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,665
New charges can always be filed.
It's not worth the risk.

746
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,568
Okay.

747
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,346
Are you disappointed in me?

748
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,684
Let's just get it over with.

749
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,322
Okay, go ahead.

750
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,993
I'd like to make a statement.

751
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:19,628
There will be
a little cleanup.

752
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,135
Some folks who will want
to linger on the story.

753
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,468
But we're over the hump,
I'd say.

754
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,303
So we can leave the house now?

755
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,309
The sooner you get back
to normal work, the better.

756
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,469
All the meetings
I had to cancel,

757
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,978
let's find a way
to get 'em back on the books.

758
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,035
 Yes, sir.

759
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,614
I need to push ahead
with the assault bill.

760
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,048
We've got your Matt Bai interview
lined up for tomorrow, but I think...

761
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,549
Maybe we should hold off on Bai
till after things quiet down.

762
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,887
That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.
Doug's right.

763
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,482
Okay. Let's get going.

764
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,520
 I'll meet you
in the car.

765
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,821
He's done a good job
handling all this.

766
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,333
Yes, he has.

767
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,301
Should we have
any more concerns?

768
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,632
He claims
he doesn't have anything else.

769
00:44:56,561 --> 00:45:00,065
Do you believe him?
I wouldn't go that far.

770
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,644
Keep an eye on him.
I plan to.

771
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:06,180
As for Raymond, we have to
strike back hard and fast.

772
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:09,582
I want him obliterated.
 More than that.

773
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,411
Let's make him suffer.

774
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:19,689
I don't know whether to be
proud or terrified.

775
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,320
Perhaps both.

776
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,957
Wish I could do more.

777
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,928
What you gonna do with her?

778
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,124
I don't know yet.

779
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,894
Probably have
to knock it down.

780
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,937
Worth more as an empty lot.

781
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,130
Is there anything else
you want to take?

782
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,433
A memento or something?

783
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:08,799
Nah.

784
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,413
I ain't one for looking back.

785
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,915
Eyes ahead.

786
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,574
Good luck, Freddy.
