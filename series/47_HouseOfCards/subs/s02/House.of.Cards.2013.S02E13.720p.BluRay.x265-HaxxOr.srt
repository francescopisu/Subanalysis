1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,341
We have a President who not only
took mind-altering medication,

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,008
a man who has his
finger on the button,

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,143
while U.S. ships are
squaring off with China,

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,280
but then instructed his White
House counsel to coach a...

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,216
Allegedly, sir.
Not proven.

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,723
...to coach a witness,

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,626
which is behavior either resulting
from the use of those drugs,

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,391
or worse, a deliberate
attempt to obstruct the law.

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,025
Now wouldn't you call
either scenario impeachable?

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,203
That's for the United States
Congress to decide, sir, not me.

11
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,900
Were you aware that the President
was taking any form of medication?

12
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,203
No, I was not.

13
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,369
Did you notice him
acting in a bizarre fashion?

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,310
Unstable, incoherent?
No, sir.

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,746
Any odd behavior?

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,872
No, sir.

17
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,043
Not even firing his Chief of Staff
in the midst of a trade war?

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,553
He didn't fire me.
I resigned.

19
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,988
Would you tell us why?

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,219
I resigned because I felt

21
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,194
I could no longer serve the President
to the best of my ability.

22
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,022
And what changed? How did you
come to that conclusion?

23
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,860
I had some fundamental
differences of opinion

24
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,872
with certain people
in the White House.

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,238
Like who? The President?
No, sir.

26
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,735
Well, what certain
people then?

27
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,575
One person, actually. The Vice
President, Frank Underwood.

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,581
He wanted you gone?

29
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,085
I can't speak as to what the Vice
President did or didn't want.

30
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,418
Was he trying
to hide anything?

31
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,957
Was he afraid you might
expose something?

32
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,458
You'd have to ask him, sir.

33
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,694
<i>What's happening in the
Judiciary Committee is a farce.</i>

34
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,958
<i>The Republicans
are exploiting the”.</i>

35
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,761
<i>Excuse me,
Mr. Vice President,</i>

36
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,596
<i>but it's not
just Republicans.</i>

37
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,534
<i>A number of Democrats
have come out</i>

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,766
<i>saying they would
support impeachment.</i>

39
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,306
<i>Including the Majority Whip,
Jackie Sharp.</i>

40
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,774
<i>Which is egregious,</i>

41
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,072
<i>since the Committee hasn't
stopped hearing testimony,</i>

42
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,081
<i>and nor has the special prosecutor
completed her investigation.</i>

43
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,413
<i>You vigorously defend
the President,</i>

44
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,612
<i>but there are reports that
you've had</i> a <i>falling out.</i>

45
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,120
<i>That you haven't
spoken in weeks.</i>

46
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,788
<i>That is simply not true.</i>

47
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,290
<i>I've spoken to senior staff
at the White House</i>

48
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,090
<i>who say the President's worried you
want to run against him in 2016.</i>

49
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>And just today, Linda Vasquez
intimated that you...</i>

50
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,064
<i>Look, I fully expect that</i>

51
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,625
<i>the President
will run in 2016,</i>

52
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,170
<i>and I hope he's
generous enough</i>

53
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,102
<i>to invite me to be
his running mate.</i>

54
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,573
<i>Impeachment, conviction.
Let's say it happens.</i>

55
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,735
<i>It won't.
He's completely innocent.</i>

56
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,642
<i>Let's say it does happen.
You become President.</i>

57
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,772
<i>Thai is not a scenario
I'm going to entertain.</i>

58
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,839
<i>But the thought must
have crossed your mind.</i>

59
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,612
<i>And one could
make the argument</i>

60
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,154
<i>that the President wouldn't
be in this predicament</i>

61
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,347
<i>if it weren't for you.</i>

62
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,249
<i>It's your staff's involvement
with Feng and Lanagin</i>

63
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,017
<i>that expanded
Dunbar's investigation,</i>

64
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,790
<i>which resulted
in the travel logs...</i>

65
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,298
<i>These impeachment hearings are the
result of political maneuvering...</i>

66
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,334
<i>Your maneuverings
or the Republicans?</i>

67
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,663
<i>Morley, I've always liked you.
You ask the tough questions,</i>

68
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,968
<i>and you can certainly
question my judgment,</i>

69
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,476
<i>but do not question
my patriotism.</i>

70
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:49,207
<i>I serve this nation and
my President, not myself.</i>

71
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,613
He's lying through his teeth.
 What we're doing is working.

72
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,516
We keep the whisper
campaign alive.

73
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,350
We spin him as power-hungry,
as duplicitous.

74
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,946
Focus attention on him.
Not you.

75
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,650
What's the latest?
Twenty percent?

76
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,991
Zogby has you at 24.
Your speech made a difference.

77
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,521
The approval numbers are
moving in the right direction.

78
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,863
We need to do more
than play the spin game.

79
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:16,464
We need to destroy Frank, offer
his head instead of mine.

80
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,477
We use Raymond Tusk.
How?

81
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,879
At his hearing. When he
goes to the Judiciary.

82
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,474
Sir, you're already being accused
of coaching one witness.

83
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,714
If you take steps to coach...
Not coaching. The truth.

84
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,484
Raymond admits to
the money laundering,

85
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,390
puts Frank at the center of
this, and says I knew nothing.

86
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,490
And then, we'll reward
him for his honesty.

87
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,997
You mean a pardon.

88
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,267
I want you to talk to him.

89
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,664
And put myself at risk?

90
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,037
Well, you're not part of
this administration anymore.

91
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,168
There's no law that says you
can't pay Raymond Tusk a visit.

92
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,007
And in return, resignations don't
have to last forever, Linda.

93
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,256
If I do this, you have to
be a million miles away.

94
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,449
Tricia and I will
go to Camp David.

95
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,757
It's not a million miles away,
but it'll do the job.

96
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,127
I can go after Linda.
Dig into her past...

97
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,725
Neutralizing her won't
neutralize the bigger problem.

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,067
It's the President
that's after blood.

99
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,105
Then what's his move?

100
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,040
He can't ask me to resign.
He'd have to force me out.

101
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,908
And to do that,
if I were him,

102
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,113
I would return to the
hand that first fed me.

103
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,412
Raymond Tusk?
Exactly.

104
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,476
No, he'd have to implicate
himself to implicate you.

105
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,786
Not if he gets a pardon.

106
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,122
It's the one thing that
only a President can offer.

107
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,626
Tusk is a hand grenade.
If he pardons him...

108
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,594
You're right.
Tusk is a hand grenade.

109
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,962
And we need to pull the pin
and throw him at Walker

110
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,796
before Walker pulls the pin
and throws him at us.

111
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,599
I want to meet with
Raymond, one on one.

112
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,638
Let me speak on your behalf.
That way if anyone finds...

113
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,733
I know Raymond. He won't
respond to anyone but me.

114
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,437
When's his hearing scheduled?

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,743
Day after tomorrow,
2200 p.m.

116
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,081
That gives us 40 hours
to make it happen.

117
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,585
Yes, sir.

118
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,380

119
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,518
I think it's mine.

120
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,767
Seth, it's 4:00
in the morning.

121
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,867
When?

122
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,096
I want you
to go with her.

123
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,572
I'll get it cleared with
Rockland right now.

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,973
Thank you.

125
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,878
Meechum says the plane will
be ready in 30 minutes.

126
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,541
Okay, good.

127
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,607
You think it was just a panic
attack or was she really trying...

128
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,742
I don't know.

129
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,118
It was bad enough they felt
they had to keep her overnight.

130
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,655
I'm gonna call the White
House physician's office,

131
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,555
see if they can recommend anyone.
Okay.

132
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,424
Wait. My phone.
It's in your hand.

133
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,766
I'll be back
some time tonight.

134
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,502
Impeachment is
our only chance.

135
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,471
Here are the seats that are still
in contention in the midterms.

136
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,599
These 13, we're gonna lose,
no matter what we do.

137
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,507
But even if we
win all the rest,

138
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,137
that only leaves us with
a five-seat majority.

139
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,182
We either save the party
or we save the President.

140
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,684
Anyone who votes
against impeachment

141
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,983
is gonna get pummeled by attack
ads between now and election day.

142
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,580
How many do you
have already?

143
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,183
We need 18. I have six.

144
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,491
So, 12 more to go.

145
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,692
Look, Donald,
I know this is a big ask

146
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,928
and you prefer to focus
on policy and not...

147
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,530
Jackie, you can stop.
I'm on board.

148
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,708
Really?
One hundred percent.

149
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,176
I have to say I'm
a little surprised.

150
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,213
When you rolled those
dollies into the cloakroom,

151
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,615
you said, "Work with me.
I'm not Frank Underwood."

152
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,016
And then you helped get my
stimulus package through,

153
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,954
just like you promised.

154
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,852
And what do you
expect this time?

155
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,961
That you never become
Frank Underwood.

156
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,957
You must realize if we're
successful, he will replace Walker.

157
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:48,033
I don't like Frank, but I hate
being in the minority even more.

158
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,802
We can't let the Republicans
control both houses of Congress.

159
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,539
You've changed since I
joined the leadership.

160
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,377
Just getting better
at playing the game.

161
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,815
I guess you can teach an
old Liberal new tricks.

162
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,075

163
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,515
I guess so.

164
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,156
So, tell me who
you still need.

165
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,363
My lawyers are saying 50-50
that I survive a trial.

166
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,161
Now, I'm not a big
fan of those odds,

167
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,928
but I'm willing
to take 'em.

168
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,230
If your lawyers are putting
it at a coin toss,

169
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,703
then you're paying them too
much to be overly optimistic.

170
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,172
And how can
I trust Garrett?

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,334
He turned his back
on 20 years of friendship.

172
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,071
He could accuse
you of the same.

173
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,168
Huh.

174
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,849
Well, nobody on this planet

175
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,682
wants to see Frank Underwood
go to jail more than I do.

176
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,052
I just don't want to be
sharing a cell with him.

177
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,113
That won't happen.

178
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,456
All you've given me
to go on is Garrett's word.

179
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,791
He's asking you
to tell the truth.

180
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,024
Good things happen to those
who do the right thing.

181
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,522

182
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,600
And you just expect Frank to
lie down, throw in the towel?

183
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,535
We don't even give him the chance.
Your testimony knocks him out cold.

184
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,077

185
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,576
Excuse me.

186
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,415
Yes? Oh.
Thank you. Hold on.

187
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,245

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,091
There you go.

189
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,968
Care package from my wife.

190
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,235
Now, you were saying?

191
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,777
I just want to warn you,
she's not herself right now.

192
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,153
They had to put her
on some heavy doses.

193
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,455
Of what?
Lithium, mostly.

194
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,360
It was either that
or commit her for 30 days.

195
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,763
Now, she just took some,
so she might be a little...

196
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,836
Megan?

197
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,398
Stop.

198
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,809
Your mom told me they
found you in the lake.

199
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,348
What do you care?

200
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,881
I care very much.

201
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,181
No, you don't.

202
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,560
You don't use somebody
you care about.

203
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,702
"Whore."

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,903
"Slut."

205
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,574
"Bitch."

206
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,772
"Traitor."

207
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,879
That's what they call me.

208
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,713
In my mail, online.

209
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,519
I wish I'd never called.

210
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,457
I wish I'd never met you.

211
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,018
I feel so stupid believing
what you told me.

212
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,190
Thinking that
you did care.

213
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,265
I was getting better.
You did this to me.

214
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,977
Every time I take one of
these, I think of him.

215
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,913
And the next face
I think of? It's yours.

216
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,619
I'm sorry that
you felt used.

217
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,592
You weren't.

218
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,822
I just...

219
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,628
Like I told you, the
political landscape shifted

220
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,105
and we found...

221
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,171
Megan?

222
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,621
 Hello?

223
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,765
I got your text.

224
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,162
I know I shouldn't be reaching
out to you, but I thought...

225
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,538
No, that doesn't matter. I'm glad you did.
How is she?

226
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,144
In bad shape.

227
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,115
I'm surprised they even let her out
of the hospital, to be honest.

228
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,843
Is there anything
I can do?

229
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,218
Should I contact her family
or go out there myself?

230
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,024
We should probably
leave her alone.

231
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,822
<i>Are you okay?</i>

232
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,989
I'm fine.
How about you?

233
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,467
<i>Holding up.</i>

234
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,004
I spent the whole day
talking to lawyers.

235
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,206
It's hard on the kids.

236
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,344
They're embarrassed and frightened,
but we'll get through it.

237
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,248
I thought the speech you and
Garrett gave was very moving.

238
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,150
<i>Well, it seems
to have helped some.</i>

239
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,585
I was inspired by you,
actually,

240
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,025
when you admitted
to the abortion on TV.

241
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,493
<i>The truth is</i>
a <i>powerful thing.</i>

242
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,166
Tricia, I want
to apologize.

243
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,334
<i>What for?</i>

244
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,899
I feel partly responsible

245
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,842
for everything your
family's going through.

246
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,177
It was my suggestion
that you get counseling.

247
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,687
And had I known then, I never
would have said a word.

248
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,684
Claire, please.
Counseling was a godsend.

249
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,228
Garrett and I needed help,
and it's made things better.

250
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,264
I should be thanking you.

251
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,924
And thank you for letting
me know about Megan.

252
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,024
It was kind of you
to make that trip.

253
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,931
<i>You're a good person,
Claire. Be well.</i>

254
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,042

255
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,976

256
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,911
I take it this is
about my hearing.

257
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,820
Did Walker get to you first?
Barely.

258
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,389
But sometimes
barely is enough.

259
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,897
I'm sure he offered
you a pardon.

260
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,558
Always better to offer something
your competitor can't.

261
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,002
Oh. But I can.

262
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,162
Hmm.

263
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,866
The last time I read
the Constitution,

264
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:50,847
the most a Vice President could
offer was a smile and a wink.

265
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,715
I think I've proven that I'm not
your typical Vice President.

266
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,912
Typical or not,
you've lost, Frank.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,581
I have an out.
You don't.

268
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,218
Garrett will not
survive impeachment.

269
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,421
If there's one skill
you can't deny,

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,227
it's my ability
to whip votes.

271
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,732
In the House.
Not in the Senate.

272
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,796
Which the Constitution
makes me the President of.

273
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,875
And you saw what I did
with entitlement.

274
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,773
Hubris is giving you delusions
of grandeur, Frank.

275
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,249
Let's say Walker squeaks by.
Yes, you get your pardon.

276
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,945
But you've bound
yourself at the hip

277
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,716
to a man who has zero political capital.

278
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,752

279
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,963
And if he gets convicted,
we all go to jail.

280
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,759
There's no pardon
for anyone.

281
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,598
I'll roll the dice.

282
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,405
Raymond, think
like a businessman.

283
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,309
Haven't you built a fortune
by minimizing risk?

284
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,314
Isn't that why you stacked
Congress all these years,

285
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:03,251
why you guided Garrett to the Oval,
and why you kept me on as Whip?

286
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,155
Walker is a junk bond
quickly depreciating,

287
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,626
whereas I can end the conflict with
China and keep you in the black.

288
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,597
You can't promise better
relations with China.

289
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,167
I wrecked them.
I can repair them.

290
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,832
Now, let's work together,
as we always intended to do.

291
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,710

292
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,716
When they put you in that box
barely bigger than a coffin,

293
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,055
remember how beautiful
the music was tonight.

294
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,532
It might give you some
small degree of comfort

295
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,801
Puccini's a downer.

296
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,309
I prefer something
much more optimistic.

297
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,545

298
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,146
They won't touch Brown.
The trial date is set.

299
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,714
They can reduce
the charges.

300
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,384
Dallas won't give.

301
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,486
If I keep pressing,
it'll start to look suspect.

302
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,500
What I can do is make sure
you don't get prosecuted.

303
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,331
And I stop working for you.
Not quite.

304
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:30,032
I told the U.S. Attorney that we
wanted to bring you on with us.

305
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,666
Cyberterrorism division.

306
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,244
You'd get a clean slate, as...
No fucking way.

307
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,073
They're not gonna
let your case go

308
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,579
unless we give them
a compelling reason.

309
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,705
There's no...

310
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,375
I've spent half my life
fighting the Bureau.

311
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,112
It's the only way
I could sell it.

312
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,387
Take this opportunity, Gavin,
before they change their minds.

313
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,019
I want to meet with
Douglas Stamper.

314
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,296
No. The deal was
I find you a way out...

315
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,922
No, the deal was you help out
Brown and you give me my freedom.

316
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,125
You haven't done
shit for Brown,

317
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,861
and you still want to
keep me under your thumb.

318
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,868
So, I meet Stamper,
or any kind of deal is off.

319
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,378

320
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,480
Raymond said no.

321
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,319
He said neither yes nor no.
I'll keep the pressure on.

322
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,224
So he could still name you. He could.
Anything's possible.

323
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,230
Well, you have to stop him.
I'm trying.

324
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,255
Well, trying's
not enough, Francis.

325
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,302
Well, I can't sit next to him in the
hearing room with a gun to his head.

326
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,167
Now that sounds like an excuse.
It's a reality.

327
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,299
You promised me I wasn't going to
have to prepare for the worst.

328
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,671
And I intend to
keep that promise.

329
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,609
Well, I want to be sure.
I want both of us to be sure.

330
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,945
The only surefire way is for
Walker to call him off personally.

331
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,484
Then make that happen.

332
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,677
I cannot force a man
who thinks I'm his enemy

333
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,585
to suddenly call me
his friend.

334
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,757
I've done what
I had to do.

335
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,922
Now, you do what
you have to do.

336
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,488
Seduce him.
Give him your heart.

337
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,431
Cut it out and put it
in his fucking hands.

338
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,203

339
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,440
 <i>"Dear Mr. President,</i>

340
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,601
<i>"I'm writing you on an Underwood
portable my father gave me</i>

said when he gave it to me</i>

<i>"that have resonated even more
than this 70-year-old machine.</i>

one of your own.'</i>

346

of what has motivated my life.</i>

letter with these keys.</i>

not fail me now.

to diminish you.</i>

381
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,801

"It is my honor to make

"Your loyal friend, still in my
heart, if not in yours, Francis."

402
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,294
The Constitution sets forth
the general principles...

403
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,800
Sir? The President's
on the phone.

404
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,815
<i>Mr. President.
I got your letter.</i>

405
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,780
I had Tricia read it, too.

406
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,787
<i>I'm torn, Frank.</i>

407
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,590
<i>Half of me wants
to think you're genuine.</i>

408
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,095
The other half doesn't
trust a word of it.

409
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,757
<i>Does Tricia feel
the same way?</i>

410
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:41,635
She believes in Claire, which
inclines her to believe in you.

411
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,505
I meant every syllable.

412
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,166
I wanted you to know
beyond a shadow of a doubt

413
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,769
that I am willing to do
whatever is necessary.

414
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,946
Well, then, why can't
I shake the shadow?

415
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,611
<i>Because I'm a liar, sir.</i>

416
00:27:56,108 --> 00:28:00,022
Because I lack scruples and
some would even say compassion.

417
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,683
But that's just the image
that I present to the world

418
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:07,025
<i>because it elicits fear and respect.
But it is not who I am.</i>

419
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:12,201
My hope was that my letter
would prove that to you.

420
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,472
Well, even if you
are being genuine,

421
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,530
that doesn't do much for me.

422
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,201
I won't survive impeachment

423
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,541
<i>because I got along
with my Vice President.</i>

424
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,809
No, I agree you need more
than my good intentions.

425
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,316
<i>Proof.</i>

426
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,880
That's what I
want to see, Frank.

427
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:36,016
And not just falling on the sword.
Show me results.

428
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,994
And then I'll reconsider whether
you're worth any of my trust at all.

429
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,891
You're talking votes.
Yeah.

430
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:45,594
<i>Whipping votes was your strong suit.
That's the side of you I want to see.</i>

431
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,432
I've already begun, sir.

432
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,238
Yeah? You have a count?

433
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,171
<i>An approximation.
The sands keep shifting.</i>

434
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,606
Well, can we survive
the House or not?

435
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,270
Possibly, but Jackie Sharp
is making it very difficult.

436
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,574
<i>Give me numbers.</i>

437
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,444
Over half of the 18
that she needs,

438
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,348
which is why I'd like to start
focusing on the Senate.

439
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,909
Don't you think
that's premature?

440
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,386
<i>We should be prepared.</i>

441
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,783
The key battle is making sure
that you avoid conviction.

442
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,092
Well, you keep whipping,

443
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,959
you keep getting me
information,

444
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,531
I'll answer your calls.

445
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,391
But don't take that as a sign
of reconciliation, Frank.

446
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,472
I'll sing for my supper, sir.
I don't expect it for free.

447
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,770
<i>Let's talk again tomorrow.</i>

448
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,868
Thank you,
Mr. President.

449
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,043
You said you
wanted options.

450
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,607
Frank didn't leave me options.
He fucked me.

451
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,913
You fucked him first
when you sided with Tusk.

452
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,886
But who cares what
happened each inning?

453
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,117
It's the final score
that counts.

454
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,888
Eight years I spent busting
my ass in this office.

455
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,888
I can't seem to escape it.
You gonna help us or not?

456
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,258
I need to know what I gain.
You'll be taken care of.

457
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,801
Specifically.

458
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,967
We'll see what makes sense when
all the chips have fallen.

459
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,734
So you just want me
to leap off a cliff

460
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,139
and hope for a soft
landing beneath?

461
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,403
No one will
touch you now.

462
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,639
Nobody except us. We're as
soft as you're gonna get.

463
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,509
A job at the White House?

464
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,150
No promises.

465
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:13,348
Other than something commensurate
with your loyalty and experience.

466
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,986
I could just walk away from it all.
Start a new life.

467
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,756
No, you can't.
You know you can't

468
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,526
You'd wither away
anywhere but the Hill.

469
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,931
It's never been about the money,
no matter what you tell yourself.

470
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,432
When I left,
Frank begged me to stay.

471
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,303
"Power versus money,"
he said.

472
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,673
Don't reduce myself
to a tax bracket.

473
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,678
He was right.
And I doubt he begged.

474
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:41,012
He was half right. Power is better
than money for as long as it lasts.

475
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,108
But it never lasts.

476
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,553
What's your answer?

477
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,362
You've gotten colder since
you've taken over this job.

478
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,401
It makes things easier.

479
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,161
On the outside.

480
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,969
And the inside.

481
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,242
I miss you, Jackie.

482
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,643
Tell me if you'll cooperate.

483
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,488
How's your brother enjoying
working with the Congressman?

484
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,148

485
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,156
Oh. Excuse me one second.

486
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,728
Mr. President.

487
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,230
<i>I want you to call Tusk.
Tell him the deal is off.</i>

488
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,425
<i>What?
You were right.</i>

489
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,896
<i>I don't want to take the risk.
But I already spoke to him.</i>

490
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,062
Well, so speak to him again.

491
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,503
And tell him
there's no pardon.

492
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:40,075
Sir, I was skeptical
of this strategy at first,

493
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,941
but now that we've gone down this
road, we should stick to it.

494
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,344
<i>Linda, do you still
want your job back?</i>

495
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,439
Of course, sir.

496
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,746
Then make the call.

497
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,953
I'd rather see what
happens in the House

498
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,253
before I get involved
in any way.

499
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,023
But if you came out vigorously
in defense of the President,

500
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,530
it might convince
the Judiciary Committee...

501
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,529
To be honest,
I'm not particularly inclined

502
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,226
to be doing
Walker any favors.

503
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,261
Now, Michael, I know he
revoked your nomination.

504
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,635
He didn't fight
for me at all.

505
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,209
Well, he'd just been elected.
He wasn't in a position to...

506
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,609
Wrong. He had
a clear mandate.

507
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,475
He was in a strong
position to defend me.

508
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,941
You're right.

509
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,610
If I had been President, I
wouldn't have given in so easily.

510
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,121
I would've stuck by you after
that article came to light.

511
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,284
In fact, if you'd been our Secretary
of State instead of Durant,

512
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,726
I don't think we'd be in the
mess we are with China.

513
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,764
But the truth is,
I wouldn't have nominated you

514
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,390
for Secretary of State
in the first place.

515
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,828
I would have nominated you
for Secretary of Treasury.

516
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,631
Because your
expertise in economics

517
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,796
is even better than your
grasp on foreign affairs.

518
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,740
Now, if I were President, you'd
be Secretary of Treasury.

519
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,075
If you were President.

520
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,979
That's right.

521
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,178
You can't do this.

522
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,917
What happened?

523
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,586
Was it Frank?

524
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,994
Linda, listen to me...

525
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,937
I understand. Thanks.

526
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,004
The deal is off.

527
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,641
Did she say why?

528
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,374
No. Other than
he changed his mind.

529
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,176
But it must be Frank.

530
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,974
Then we go back to
the original plan.

531
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,610
That's right. You plead the
Fifth just like you did before.

532
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,120
This is political theater.
We get past it...

533
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,179
Jesus Christ.
What is it?

534
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,556
Remy Danton is volunteering to
testify to Dunbar, right now.

535
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,856
He volunteered?
He wasn't subpoenaed?

536
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,555
Looks that way.

537
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,291
He's gonna sell me out.

538
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,359
That would open him up
to prosecution.

539
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,802
Unless he's being protected.

540
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,568
Where's Danton?

541
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,648
I'll call his assistant.

542
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,344
Did you or did you not
facilitate foreign money

543
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,822
being funneled into political
action committees?

544
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,985
On the advice
of my counsel,

545
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,428
I reserve my right to invoke
the Fifth Amendment.

546
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,499
Xander Feng claims
you not only facilitated,

547
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,159
you orchestrated the scheme.

548
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,170
Now, what is your response
to that testimony?

549
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,099
On the advice of my counsel,
I reserve my right to...

550
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,041
You can reserve your right
all day long, Mr. Tusk.

551
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,443
But when you appear
in front of a grand jury,

552
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,176
as I'm sure the Justice
Department intends,

553
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,082
your silence will
be your downfall.

554
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,278
Does the Congressman
have a question?

555
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,356
You can hide from us
all you want, sir.

556
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,551
You cannot hide from
a jury of your peers.

557
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,592
Mr. Chairman...

558
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,752
That's it. I'm done.

559
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,921
I relinquish the
remainder of my time.

560
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,431
The Chair recognizes the
Congresswoman from Tennessee.

561
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,092
You have 12 minutes, ma'am.

562
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,195
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently
embroiled in a trade war with China.

563
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,367
It has gutted our economy.

564
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:03,140
It has placed our navy in harm's way.
The President who put us there has...

565
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,440
He knew.

566
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,038

567
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,242
Excuse me?
My client reserves the...

568
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,152
He knew. Isn't that what
you're all wondering?

569
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:14,956

570
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,615
Quiet, please.

571
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,723
Knew what, exactly?

572
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,593
There was a mechanism

573
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,634
by which a great
many contributions

574
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,794
were made over
the last 10 years.

575
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,394
The legality of this
mechanism is something

576
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,940
that I continue to believe

577
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,499
is within the
boundaries of the law.

578
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,814
<i>But as for the mechanism
itself, Mr. Feng is correct.</i>

579
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,782
<i>I orchestrated it.
I facilitated it.</i>

580
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,913
<i>And the President
knew about it.</i>

581
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,820
Danton just canceled.

582
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,187
Screw Danton.
We've got Tusk.

583
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,255
Get me the Attorney General.

584
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,498
That won't be necessary,
Mr. Tusk.

585
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,973
If you'll come with us.

586
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,510
That's a shame.

587
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,704
Handcuffs were another
item on my bucket list.

588
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,838
Right this way, sir. You have
the right to remain silent.

589
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,110
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

590
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,620
We'll want a bond. For his
cooperation in the hearing.

591
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,348
I'll talk bonds
if you'll talk a plea.

592
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,057
<i>Response to the testimony
has been swift and vocal.</i>

593
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,289
<i>Protesters have been gathering
in from of the White House</i>

594
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,695
<i>since yesterday,</i>

595
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,858
<i>demanding President
Walker's resignation.</i>

596
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,526
<i>And an online petition
has already accumulated</i>

597
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,471
<i>over 200,000 signatures
in the past 24 hours.</i>

598
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,873
<i>The list of lawmakers publicly
condemning the President</i>

599
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,966
<i>has grown on both sides
of the aisle.</i>

600
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,171
<i>And this afternoon,</i>

601
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,215
<i>the Chinese ambassador also condemned
the Walker administration,</i>

602
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,648
<i>saying China would not
negotiate with a President</i>

603
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,245
<i>who dealt with corrupt businessmen
behind Beijing's back.</i>

604
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,550
<i>This at a time when warships
from both countries...</i>

605
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,216
<i>Meanwhile, the President
and First Lady</i>

606
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,887
<i>remain bunkered at Camp David and
have offered no public response</i>

607
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,895
<i>to the most recent
developments in Washington.</i>

608
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,556
<i>I'm here with Ayla Sayyad
of the </i>Wall Street Telegraph.

609
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,363
<i>Ayla, I have to
begin by saying</i>

610
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,835
<i>that sources on the
Hill are telling me</i>

611
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,396
<i>that the Judiciary Committee may
bypass debate all together.</i>

612
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,737
<i>No one on the Committee has
gone on record about that,.</i>

613
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,607
<i>But do you think these rumors
would be circulating</i>

614
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,611
<i>if there weren't some sort
of strong preference</i>

615
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,579
<i>to recommend the Articles of
Impeachment to the House?</i>

616
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,242
<i>I think it's safe to assume
there is strong support.</i>

617
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,546
<i>Every poll I've seen</i>

618
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,248
<i>shows an overwhelming majority of
Americans want this to move forward.</i>

619
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,346
<i>I don't think politicians
are going to ignore that.</i>

620
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,958
I've talked lo a number
of my colleagues already.

621
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,926
There's support on
my side of the aisle.

622
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,089
Well, how many do you have? Five
at this point, including me.

623
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,929
That would put us at 60.
We'd still need seven more.

624
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,593
You've seen
the overnight polls.

625
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,229
He's dipped down into
the single digits.

626
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,604
Are you willing to make a
public statement with us?

627
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,108
I think the country could use

628
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,702
a little bipartisanship
right now, don't you?

629
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,214
<i> Do you think
they're bluffing?</i>

630
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:57,081
That it's some sort of stunt to
sway the undecideds in the Senate?

631
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,380
Michael Kern is bitter
and small-minded, sir,

632
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,152
but he wouldn't appear
publicly with Mendoza

633
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,783
if they didn't
have the numbers.

634
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,328
<i>Well, I imagine we're worse off
in the House than we were before.</i>

635
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,557
In fact, I had a very productive
conversation with Jackie Sharp.

636
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,157
<i>She agreed to
stop the attack</i>

637
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,066
if we give her our support for
majority leader after the midterms.

638
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,800
But once Raymond gave his testimony,
she called to say the deal was off.

639
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,967
Raymond really
has set us back.

640
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,738
<i>I can't fathom why he lied.</i>

641
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,675
Well, it's retribution.

642
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,845
For what? The energy crisis?
No.

643
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,614
Did you offer
him something?

644
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,924
Well, Raymond's
testimony hurts,

645
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,118
but it can't
finish us off.

646
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,128
It's impossible
to prove a lie.

647
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,921
Impeachment is inevitable.

648
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,763
Public opinion is the adversary now.
Facts no longer matter.

649
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:49,764
You should give Kern a call.
The personal touch.

650
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,503
If he came back to us, it might make
the other Democrats get cold feet.

651
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,635
Well, China isn't helping.

652
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,180
President Qian won't return my calls.
Beijing must smell death.

653
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,274
They're just exploiting
the situation for leverage.

654
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,013
Let's not worry about
China for the moment.

655
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,679
One battle at a time, sir.

656
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,054
<i>Maybe I'm finished, Frank.</i>

657
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,022
Maybe I need to start accepting
that we won't pull out of this.

658
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:17,156
<i>Mr. President, I know you're tired.
I know this has been hell for you.</i>

659
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,998
And, yes, impeachment
would be an awful blow.

660
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,629
We'd have to fight tooth
and nail in the Senate.

661
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,373
<i>And, yes, we'll have
to beg and compromise</i>

662
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,534
to regain our
political capital.

663
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,805
But we have it in us, sir.

664
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,508
No matter how many scars
it leaves us with.

665
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,383
It's not just us, Frank.

666
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,578
It's Tricia.
It's my children.

667
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,586
I stay awake at night, thinking
how much it would crush them,

668
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,718
seeing their
father hauled off.

669
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,263
Sir, that won't happen
because I won't let it.

670
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,696
If we're confronted
by the worst,

671
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,995
I'll make sure you never
step foot behind bars.

672
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,492
<i>You have my word on that.</i>

673
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:01,237
He's in the darkness now, and
I'm the only beacon of light.

674
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,609
Now we gently guide him
toward the rocks.

675
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,217
Mr. President, you also
still have my letter.

676
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,212
<i>It's not too late, if you
want to use that option.</i>

677
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:15,019
No, you're more useful to me
on the Hill than in handcuffs.

678
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,250
I'll call Kern.

679
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,260
<i>Goodnight, sir.
'Night.</i>

680
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,212

681
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,226
How much did
Green tell you?

682
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,463
Enough that I showed up.

683
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,228
He probably didn't
mention Rachel Posner?

684
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,734
Don't worry. He doesn't know.
I do.

685
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,175
You have her in
an apartment in Joppa.

686
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,810
I have your movements.

687
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:13,144
I have your text messages before
you destroyed your phone.

688
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,342
But that's more
than enough.

689
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,349
I'll bet a lot of people would
like to know what she knows.

690
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:24,255
Now, you listen to me
very carefully.

691
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,261
Whatever you
think you've got,

692
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,127
whatever you intend
to do with it,

693
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:32,828
I don't respond to extortion
the same way that Green does.

694
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:38,298
What Green promised you, that
can be undone in a heartbeat.

695
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,311
And that's why you're here.
Make sure it isn't.

696
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,346
You want my protection.

697
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,318
I don't trust Green
or anyone at the Bureau.

698
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,886
Who else knows
about this?

699
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,690
No one.

700
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,292
Why should I trust you?

701
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,367
'Cause we both have
too much to lose, man.

702
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,661
Get dressed.

703
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,158
What are you doing here?

704
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,496
Put some clothes on.

705
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,736
Why? Why?

706
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,327
Now. Let's go.

707
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,172
Did anyone contact you?

708
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,742
Where are you taking me?

709
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,043
Answer my question.

710
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,543
No. Nobody.

711
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,218
There's someone
who knows about us.

712
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,195
Who knows where you are
and when we've met.

713
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,869
Are you gonna hurt me?

714
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,733
Nothing's going to happen
if you tell the truth.

715
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,571
I am. I haven't been
contacted by anybody.

716
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,572
Stop lying, Rachel.

717
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,317
I will do whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me.

718
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,613
What I want

719
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,949
is for you to answer my
questions, so I can help you.

720
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,751
All you have ever done
is fuck up my life.

721
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:36,985
You fucked up
the fellowship.

722
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,219
You fucked up what
I had with Lisa.

723
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,454
Even when I did
what you asked.

724
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,053
And your sick
fucking visits,

725
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,157
and reading to you
like a fucking child.

726
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,496
What is wrong with you?

727
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,127
Why can't you
just leave me be?

728
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,569
Why do you have to be
such a fucking...

729
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,970
Stop!

730
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,714
Rachel? Don't be stupid.

731
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,190
Rachel?

732
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,492
Everything's gonna be fine.

733
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,841
All I've ever done
is try to protect you.

734
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,037
That's what I'm
trying to do now.

735
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,306
You have to believe that.

736
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,685
I didn't have to.
Be a lot easier if I didn't.

737
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,486
But I did.

738
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,989
I did it because I...

739
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,357

740
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,152

741
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,062
What are you doing?

742
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,702

743
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,357
Yesterday, we completed hearings
with regard to Articles of Impeachment

744
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,726
for the President
of the United States.

745
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,527
The Chair will now entertain
motions from the committee.

746
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,692
Mr. Chairman.

747
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,965
The Chair recognizes the
Congressman from Alabama.

748
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,232
I move that we put our
recommendation directly to a vote

749
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,242
so that debate
on this important matter

750
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:11,610
may take place on the House
floor, open to all 435 members.

751
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,884
Are there any objections to
bypassing debate in this committee?

752
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,788
We will now vote
on recommendation

753
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,756
of the Articles of Impeachment
to the full House.

754
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,316
Those in favor of
recommendation, Say "Aye"

755
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,554
Aye.

756
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,618
Those opposed?

757
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,163
Nay.

758
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,459
The "ayes" have it.

759
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,124
This committee
officially recommends

760
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,466
Articles of Impeachment
proceed to the House ﬂoor.

761
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:37,129

762
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,587

763
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,656
He's here.

764
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,599
Sir, the President
wants you at Camp David.

765
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,853
 <i>The Vice President is just
arriving now here at Camp David.</i>

766
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,689
<i>We expect President Walker
to speak within the hour,</i>

767
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:37,027
<i>announcing his official resignation
as President of the United States.</i>

768
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,138
How are you?

769
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,047
I'm fine.

770
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,409
Mr. President.

771
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,987
I have coffee in the kitchen.
Would you like some?

772
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,048
I'm fine.
No, thank you.

773
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,893
Well, you're
about to become

774
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,905
the most powerful man
in the free world.

775
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,032
You don't have
to do this, sir.

776
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,943
I spoke to Kern last night.
He's not gonna back down.

777
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,208
So we'll beat him down.
No, Frank.

778
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,011
My approvals are at 8%.

779
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,577
Even if I avoid conviction,
I have no mandate to lead.

780
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,885
So, better I step aside
with some dignity

781
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,051
so the nation
can start to heal.

782
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,100
I can never fill
your shoes, sir.

783
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,740
Well, you don't
have a choice now.

784
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,906
Your letter.

785
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,956
Well, shall we go introduce

786
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,760
the 46th President
of the United States?

787
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,145
<i> Effective immediately,</i>

788
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,845
I am resigning the Presidency
of the United States.

789
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:44,488
Tricia and I believe that this
is the best course of action,

790
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:48,530
not only for us and our
children, but for the country.

791
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:52,962
It's a sad day for us.
I can't deny that.

792
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,661
But I take solace in this.

793
00:49:56,427 --> 00:50:01,706
Frank Underwood will bring
virtue, experience and courage

794
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,540
to the Oval Office.

795
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:06,672
I have been blessed to have
him as my Vice President.

796
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,774
But I'm even more blessed
to call him my friend.

797
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,112
It has been

798
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,786
the greatest honor of my life to
serve this country as President.

799
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:27,165
I thank my family, my staff, and all
of those who have supported me.

800
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,868
Despite the last few months,

801
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,135
my faith in this country
has never been stronger.

802
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,642
God bless all of you.

803
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,645
And God bless the United
States of America.

804
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,844
Thank you, Mr. President,
for those words.

805
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,651
Good luck to you, sir.

806
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:04,037
Sir, please raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

807
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:09,706
"I, Francis J. Underwood..."

808
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,010
"...do solemnly swear..."

809
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,843
Mr. President.

810
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:19,886
Madam Secretary.

811
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,424
The rest of the Cabinet is
awaiting you at the White House.

812
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,084
We'd like to give you a national
security briefing right away, sir.

813
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,126
I'm aware of
the particulars.

814
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,025
Can you please get
Beijing on the phone?

815
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,623
Qian hasn't returned the
President's calls for two days.

816
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:35,025
Well, there's
a new President now.

817
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,597
Please get him
on the line.

818
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,075
Two hours ago,
President Underwood,

819
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,475
in his first act
as Commander-in-Chief,

820
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,912
gave orders to the Seventh Fleet
to vacate Japanese waters.

821
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,612
This was a result of a productive
conversation with President Qian,

822
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:54,281
who gave similar orders to Chinese
naval vessels in the same region.

823
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:55,322
He moves quick.

824
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,325
Do you mean with the
Chinese or with Walker?

825
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,118

826
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,563
Mr. Feng?
What is it?

827
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,728
U.S. Justice Department.
We need you to come with us.

828
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,964
Where?
You're going back to China.

829
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,902
I have asylum.

830
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,272
No, sir, you don't. Your
asylum has been rescinded.

831
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,068
I have it in writing.
"Unconditional and permanent."

832
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,910
Sir, I'm telling you, your
asylum has been rescinded.

833
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,247
Now, please, gather your
things and come with us.

834
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,984
Revoking his asylum
will have consequences.

835
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,854
But we're solid from
a legal perspective?

836
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,586
Legally, yes.

837
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,823
His initial paperwork
hasn't been processed,

838
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,024
and we can claim he poses a
threat to our national interests.

839
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:41,126
But ii diminishes the integrity
of our State Department.

840
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,106
What's more important, Cathy?
Integrity or peace?

841
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,638
You know they'll execute him.

842
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,678
The Chinese are right
about one thing.

843
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,804
Sometimes you have to
sacrifice the one

844
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:53,143
for the many.

845
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,277
Let's get back
to Washington.

846
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,943

847
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,357
Okay. Please let me know.
Thanks very much.

848
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:09,863
Anything?
Not yet.

849
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,297
See if you can track down anyone
from his regular AA meetings.

850
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,357
I spoke to the moderator.

851
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,494
He says he hasn't seen
Doug in several weeks.

852
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,869
I checked all the hospitals,
his landlord...

853
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,531
Sir, everyone's here.

854
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,631
All right,
when this is all over

855
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,473
I want you to work
with Nancy on finding Doug.

856
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,639
I've already alerted the D.C. Metro.
They put out an APB on his car.

857
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:26,909
We'll find him, sir.

858
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,881
Claire?
Just outside.

859
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,576
Let's go, Nancy.

860
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,691
Excuse me.

861
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:44,523
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President and the First Lady.

862
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,327
Mr. President.

863
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,662
Mr. President.

864
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,169
Mr. President.

865
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,363
Sir.

866
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,974
Francis,

867
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,940
I know your birthday
isn't for a couple of weeks,

868
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,211
but I got you something.

869
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,481
What's this?
Open it.

870
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,052
I had a new one made.

871
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,899
I love you.
I love you, too.

872
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,606
You go ahead.

873
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,300
Come on.
We earned this together.

874
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,241
Take a few moments
for yourself first.

875
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,907
I'll be out here.
