00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,390
<i>We've got an energy
crisis, Frank.</i>

00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,555
<i>Now, what the
White House needs to...</i>

4
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,963
The President chose to
remain tough on China.

5
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,899
<i>No. You forced him to.
You chose Feng.</i>

6
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,438
<i>You're the one who put me
in</i> a <i>room with him.</i>

<i>The cook cam blame
his ingredients</i>

8

<i>if he doesn't like
how they taste together.</i>

9
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,769
If samarium prices
don't reduce,

10
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,744
the market will have
no choice but to compensate.

11
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:46,407
That's bad for everyone
who owns an air conditioner.

12
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,214
You should speak to
the President himself.

13
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,579
Well, the President
hasn't placed

14
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,057
much value on
my advice lately.

15
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,559
I'm in the same boat
as you, Raymond.

16
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,960
<i>Yeah, difference being
you've got an office</i>

17
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,122
three doors down
from the Oval.

18
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,591
Let's work together
for Christ's sakes.

19
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,898
I'm willing to put Spotsylvania
behind us if you are.

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,839
I want nothing more.
Then you'll talk to him?

21
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,409
Look, I'm late for
a meeting, Raymond.

22
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,934
Yes or no, Frank? I can't
guarantee he'll listen.

23
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,013
That's not a yes.
But it's better <i>than</i> a no.

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,612
Any pugilist worth his salt knows
when someone's on the ropes,

25
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,120
that's when you throw
a combination to the gut

26
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,917
and a left hook to the jaw.

27
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,579
Samarium is the last thing
they'll let go of.

28
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,592
As long as our energy prices
rise, they have the leverage.

29
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,561
Why don't we offer nothing?
Move toward attrition.

30
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,598
If China doesn't show
at the refunding auction,

31
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,098
long-term interest
rates will spike.

32
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,600
In a week, yields on
our 10-year notes

33
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,104
will pierce the 7% threshold.
Thai could happen.

34
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,936
But if we go soft now,
that will happen.

35
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,100
 You mean
go on the offensive.

36
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,370
 We should
at least consider it.

37
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,468
The Chinese
don't like carrots.

38
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,274
Let's see how
they like the stick.

39
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,404
Well, what might
that look like?

40
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,877
We could raise inspection
rates on foodstuffs.

41
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,043
Hold them in our
ports till they rot.

42
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,217
 How much of a raise?
 20% if we want to draw blood.

43
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,780
Bury the move with increased
spot checks all the way around.

44
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,292
These sort of tactics don't
solve the immediate problem.

45
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,988
People are paying triple the
standard rate for electric.

46
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,928
We'll hit a five-fold
increase by August.

47
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,297
What if you, Mr. President,
by executive order,

48
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,801
purchase samarium
through a third party?

49
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,166
Cut the Chinese out.

50
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,433
Force them to either raise
their prices worldwide

51
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,236
or lower them to keep
direct flow with us.

52
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,406
We stockpile samarium for
defense purposes, of course,

53
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,845
and quietly sell
what we don't need

54
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,244
to our friends
in nuclear energy.

55
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,608
At a discount.

56
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,515
COMMERCE SECRETARY:
A subsidy for nuclear power?

57
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,814
The richest of the rich?
How's that gonna play?

58
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,150
 We're dealing
with a national crisis.

59
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,918
We can't get sidetracked
with public opinion.

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,586
 It would show China
we're willing to wait this out.

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,856
Do we have the resources?

62
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,693
I'd have to run the numbers,
anticipate fluctuations,

63
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,165
consider different models...
Your best guess.

64
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,269
We do.
For a moderate stockpile.

65
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,473
All right, draw up a request
from the Defense Department.

66
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,533
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,112
Linda, draft the
executive order.

68
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,977
And Cathy, make sure
we have a third-party conduit

69
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,549
to purchase the samarium.
 We'll go through India.

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,342
That won't fly well
with Pakistan.

71
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,550
 I'll alert
them in advance.

72
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,520
As long as they're in the
loop, we'll be all right.

73
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,023
Not that we owe
them any favors.

74
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,787
All right.
Let's get to work.

75
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,998
<i>Come on, Betsy. Three
additional counts under Section E?</i>

76
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,125
Three is low. It reflects
a narrow interpretation

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,532
of criminal intent.

78
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,864
Your client broke
into a data center.

79
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,870
What's the offer?
I'm not doing a plea.

80
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,804
Let me handle this.
They don't want a trial.

81
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,407
The questions I'll be raising
loud and clear in open court...

82
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,499
Lucas, please.

83
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,544
We have our own
questions, Mr. Goodwin.

84
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,671
For example, what were
you doing with these?

85
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,476
I didn't take these.
They were in your apartment.

86
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,541
 Underwood took them.

87
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,314
Do you really expect
a jury to believe that?

88
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,411
He did. They were
having an affair...

89
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,148
Or are they gonna see
them for what they are?

90
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,082
Proof of your obsession
with Ms. Barnes

91
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,524
and a ludicrous conspiracy

92
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,425
you have concocted
to explain her death.

93
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,155
Tell us what
you're offering.

94
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,994
Your client pleads to
one count under Section E

95
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,227
for breaking into a data
center, one count for fraud,

96
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,597
for stealing the password
from The Herald.

97
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,693
Ten years under Section E.
Ten years for fraud.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,832
Served concurrently. Eligible
for parole in seven.

99
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,708
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

100
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,508
Cameras and recording
equipment off, please.

101
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,340

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,046
I'll introduce the President.
Then he'll introduce you.

103
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,249
If he's there, we can't
mention the military.

104
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,222
Just the endemic
problem nationwide.

105
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,261
Of course. I understand.
Good.

106
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,024
So we should go
through these speeches

107
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,086
and make sure that there's nothing...

108
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,898
Oh. Hi, Mrs. Underwood.

109
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,859
Hello, Christina.

110
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,429
Mrs. Walker,
you asked for me?

111
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,027
We need to confirm
whether the President's

112
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,299
going to make it
to New Orleans.

113
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,033
This Friday, correct?
Yes.

114
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,269
But I know he had a cabinet meeting
this morning, so I imagine...

115
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,038
I'll talk to Linda
right away.

116
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,542
Thanks.

117
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,547
I know you want Garrett there,
but with this energy crisis...

118
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,416
No. It's not that.
What?

119
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,814
I shouldn't say anything. Well,
now you have to tell me.

120
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,125
I've just never been very
fond of her, Christina.

121
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,230
Why not?
Peter Russo.

122
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,966
I just have a thing about women
who sleep with their bosses.

123
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,071
Anyway, I'm sure whatever
they had was genuine.

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,132
It's none of my business, 'cause
if she's doing a good job,

125
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,734
that's all that
matters, right?

126
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,303
Garrett seems
to think she is.

127
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,910
Then I should just keep
my feelings to myself.

128
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,818
So if the President
is not able to be there,

129
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,513
that could be a
silver lining for us.

130
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,783
We won't have to hold
back with the military.

131
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,626
 Phone taps,
video surveillance,

132
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,495
premeditation, sustained intent.
They've got you cold.

133
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,498
If I plead out, that's it.
No one hears the truth.

134
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,001
If you don't plead, no one
will hear you, period.

135
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,503
Not until you're
in your 70s.

136
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,038
Have you talked
to Hammerschmidt yet?

137
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,505
You're in no position
to make demands.

138
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,973
It's not up to you.

139
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,170
All you'll do is
piss them off.

140
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,547
Look, we've got
a good deal here.

141
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,050
A great deal, considering
what you did.

142
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,680
You should take it before
they change their mind.

143
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,816
Tom Hammerschmidt. I talk to
him, or we're going to trial.

144
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,127
<i>Raise</i>
your arms, please.

145
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,357

146
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,660
You have
something here?

147
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,199
My neck chain.

148
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,034
May I see it?
Really?

149
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,836
I gotta take
off my tie.

150
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,501
I need to see it, sir.

151
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,517
You're a good
Christian, Remy.

152
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,679
My mother's. She was
the good Christian.

153
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,745
Well, then you're
just the good son.

154
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,880
Thank you, sir.

155
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,186
 Hot out there, huh?

156
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,188
Ninety six,
according to my car.

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,888
We had heat like that
back in Gaffney,

158
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,987
but we didn't know
what air conditioning was,

159
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,692
so we just
accepted <i>as</i> fact

160
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,757
that summer was meant
to be miserable.

161
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,200
Neat or with water?

162
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,432
Just the water.
You can hold the bourbon.

163
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,230
We need to
find a solution

164
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,071
so that this one isn't miserable
for 300 million people.

165
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,543
I already have
found a solution.

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,671
Please, Frank.
A samarium subsidy?

167
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,409
Is that your skepticism
or Raymond's?

168
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,347
Mine, anticipating his.

169
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,750
So you haven't
spoken to him yet.

170
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,719
I want to offer him
something he can agree to.

171
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,918
Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.
Why are you cornering him?

172
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,428
I'm cutting the rate by half.
I'd call that liberating him.

173
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,622
You know that's not
how he'll see it.

174
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,596
This trade war is
preventing the refinery

175
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,792
from being approved
in Beijing.

176
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,234
His co-venture with Feng is not
our highest priority right now.

177
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,569
A rare earth refinery solves
this crisis permanently.

178
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,403
Three years from now.
Not this summer.

179
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,774
It's not just that. With the
subsidy, he'll break even at best.

180
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,936
There's no point
in doing business

181
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,206
to hover between
red and black.

182
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,477
Raymond's profits are an even lower
priority to me than his co-venture.

183
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,218
Tell me what
you're up to, Frank.

184
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,149
There's nothing to gain
by locking horns with Tusk.

185
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,091
Ask your client. Ifs Tusk
who's locking the horns.

186
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,629
He's not a man
who likes conflict.

187
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,327
Neither am I.

188
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,967
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know
you don't care about the subsidy.

189
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,801
This is about
something bigger.

190
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,239
I'm a good Christian,
Remy, like your mother.

191
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,573
I would tell you the
truth if I wanted more.

192
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,771
You trying to
send a message?

193
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,144
Perhaps.
Which is?

194
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,945
That stubbornness is far
more costly than obedience.

195
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,178
Thanks for the water.

196
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,482
You're on the
wrong side, Remy.

197
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,924
Yeah, well,
one of us sure is.

198
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,160
"And when the
bumblebee flew home,

199
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,529
"all his friends were waiting
with buckets of honey." Right?

200
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,933
And he's got his worm friend,
and his mouse friend,

201
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,337
and his spider friend,
and his snail friend.

202
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,964
And they all had
tons of honey.

203
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,173
And he looks
happier now, right?

204
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,301
Yeah!
Yeah?

205
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:12,146
"And so, they all
buzzed with happiness.

206
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:16,381
"Because life is sweet when you
spend it with your friends.“

207
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,347
Right? Can you all buzz your wings?
Buzz your little wings.

208
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,789

209
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,856
I think it would make
a fluttering noise, like...

210
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,022
Like...
I don't know.

211
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,565
Your flutters?

212
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,866

213
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,839
It's too hot out here for you
to be doing this, Francis.

214
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,244
I'm keeping hydrated.

215
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,150
Is that even regulation?
It's only half.

216
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,487
But I don't want the press to see
me practicing on the street.

217
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,027
You remember when you threw out
that first pitch in Greenville?

218
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,691
I was wondering how long it was
gonna take you to bring that up.

219
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,098
That wasn't even on
national television.

220
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,398
Good luck.
Thank you.

221
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,436
What happened
in Greenville?

222
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:16,742
The Greenville Drive, Single-A
team for the Red Sax.

223
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,907
It was a home game.

224
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,417
I get on the mound...
You threw from the mound?

225
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,781
Well, I wanted to
throw a real pitch.

226
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,781
Didn't make it?
Not even close.

227
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,284
Halfway?

228
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,195
Ball slipped out of my hand
just before I released it.

229
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,200
Went straight up in the air.
Hit me on top of the head.

230
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,736
The whole stadium
burst a gut laughing.

231
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,530
Comic relief pitcher.

232
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,030
That's very clever,
Meechum.

233
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,471
Don't tell Claire.

234
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,412
I heard that.

235
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,476
You're really good with them.

236
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,953
Did you see Robbie when
they were finger-painting?

237
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,456
He pulled down his pants and
started painting himself blue.

238
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,617
No.
Yeah. Hope I got it all off.

239
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,285
I'm sure Alex
and Daria don't care.

240
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,330
They let him run around
naked all the time.

241
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,229
Yeah, but probably
not with a Smurf ass.

242
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,791

243
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,728
What do we want to do
for dinner tonight?

244
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,500
I've got some leftover chicken,
or we could order pizza.

245
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,734
Pizza. No dishes.
Yeah.

246
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,276

247
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,910
I'm really sorry.

248
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,747
I totally forgot I've got a
friend picking me up tonight.

249
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,582
I completely blanked.
That's fine.

250
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,950
I'm really sorry.

251
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,152
Don't sweat it.
Is it your boyfriend?

252
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,252
No, no.
Just an old friend.

253
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,460
Can I meet him?

254
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,434
Um, he's kind of shy. I don't
know if he'd be up for...

255
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,094
Totally cool.
Don't worry about it.

256
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,105
We'll just do dinner
another night.

257
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,773
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah.
You know where I'll be.

258
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,285
 How long?
Couple of months.

259
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,355
Why didn't you tell me?
I can't go to church?

260
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,292
Anywhere you interact with other
people opens us up to risk.

261
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,353
I'm just supposed to slave away
at the fucking call center

262
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,796
and then lock myself
in the apartment.

263
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,800
Don't get dramatic.
I like the fellowship.

264
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,368
Okay? There there's nothing
to worry about there.

265
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,033
All it takes is one person's
cousin to visit from Lynchburg.

266
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,370
Someone you went
to school with

267
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,240
or some client that you
spent the night with.

268
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,347
Those guys would never end up here.
You don't know that.

269
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,676
Yeah. I do.

270
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,717
You ended up here,
didn't you?

271
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,155
I can't live like this.
What?

272
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,852
I can't live like this.
Yes, you can.

273
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,325
You're a strong girl.

274
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,034
<i>That's it?
That's everything?</i>

275
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,067
I know. You've
heard it before.

276
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,234
<i>As a friend, Lucas.
Not as a reporter.</i>

277
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:08,877
<i>Now I dig. I make the phone calls.
I do the legwork.</i>

278
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:15,115
<i>They treating you okay?
It's fine.</i>

279
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,784
<i>That's not what I asked.</i>

280
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,788
They're pushing the
plea deal pretty hard.

281
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,229
<i>How seriously are
you considering it?</i>

282
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,266
I want to see how this
article impacts things.

283
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,030
What does your
lawyer say?

284
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,073
He thinks that's a bad idea.
That I should take the plea.

285
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,238
<i>Maybe you should listen to him.
No. I want the article.</i>

286
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,376
That I'm certain of.

287
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,712
All right. I better
get to it then.

288
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,308
<i>Thank you.</i>

289
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,752
You need to know,

290
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,756
I'm gonna treat this the way
I would any other story.

291
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,622
Whatever the facts bear. You
might not like what I write.

292
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,058
<i>I get that.</i>

293
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,620
I'll let you read it first.
Then you can decide.

294
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,789
<i>That's ail I'm asking.</i>

295
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,290
<i>Hang in there.</i>

296
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,765

297
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,409
Can you wipe
this off'? Please?

298
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,610
And the other nuclear
providers are on board?

299
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,656
Most. Except
Raymond Tusk's company.

300
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,156
Couple of others. Lakeport
Nuclear, Wolf Springs.

301
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,318
Now, I can't prove it,

302
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,158
but I am absolutely
sure they're colluding.

303
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,258
Raymond wants
to embarrass me.

304
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,428
I offer a solution. Nuclear
lobby turns its back.

305
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,529
He has the right
to refuse, Mr. President.

306
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,302
What he cannot do is
manipulate the energy market.

307
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,142
You want to put pressure
on the distribution side.

308
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,113
More than pressure. Ban
vertical integration entirely.

309
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,945
We don't have that
regulatory power.

310
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,679
We add an antitrust agreement
to the Emergency Energy Bill.

311
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,517
We break up the regional supply
and distribution monopolies,

312
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,057
like the Bell System.

313
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,023
It'll be challenged
immediately in the courts.

314
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,992
We don't need it to pass.

315
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,793
We just need to threaten him.
See if he falls into line.

316
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,702
Is there a way to do that without
it making its way into the news?

317
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,901
I don't want the world's wealthiest
one percent on my phone sheet.

318
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,037
There is absolutely
a way to do that, sir.

319
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,313

320
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,213
Here you go.

321
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,550
Crowded for
a Tuesday night.

322
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,151
We keep it at 65 degrees,
and it's free.

323
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,720
If you call 18 bucks
for a vodka soda free.

324
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,730
Still cheaper
than a Pepco bill.

325
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,665
Depends on how many you have?
You trying to get us drunk?

326
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,567
Drunker you are,
bigger your tip.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,102
I don't have to be drunk
to appreciate good service.

328
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,007
I'll get your change.

329
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,239
No, you won't.
Thank you.

330
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,217
You're shameless.
Makes me a good lobbyist.

331
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,514
Cheers.

332
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,722
So, Jackie, bold move,
but it won't work.

333
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,025
You know we can pass this
amendment in a heartbeat.

334
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,394
Maybe, but no one'll comply.

335
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,434
It'll get overturned.
Big fuss for nothing.

336
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,470
It might get overturned,
but it gets ink along the way.

337
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,970
One thing I learned
about Raymond Tusk

338
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,063
is he doesn't give two bird
shits about public opinion.

339
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,472
His stockholders do.

340
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,103
They'd jump in
a pit of snakes

341
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,042
and light themselves on
fire if he gave the word.

342
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,048
All I'm asking is that you
convey our intentions.

343
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,218
Why me? Frank could
easily pick up the phone.

344
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,117
You still call
him Frank?

345
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,952
Not to his face, which I
try to keep to a minimum.

346
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,753
Don't you appreciate having
an ear in the White House?

347
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,659
I would if I had an ear. But
lately, all I've got is a mouth.

348
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,159
Yeah. He's not the
best listener, is he?

349
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,668
Try working for him.
You were on his staff?

350
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,831
Eight years, press secretary.
Before you joined Congress.

351
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,669
That explains a lot.

352
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,138
Like what?

353
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,944
Like a lot.

354
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,482
I'll take that as an insult.
You should.

355
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,344
That's it?
You're abandoning me?

356
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,786
No, I'm buying
the next round.

357
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:10,189
I can't accept gifts from
lobbyists without reciprocating.

358
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,023
Plus, I'm a good wingman.

359
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,655
This gets you more face
time with the barmaid.

360
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,184
You already got 'em ready?

361
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,516
Your guys gave me the
heads-up you were coming.

362
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,181
Well, I hope that they didn't
wake you earlier than usual.

363
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,726
Fuck, man. With this heat,
I ain't sleeping much anyway.

364
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,321
What? No AC at home?
Oh, I got a unit.

365
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,066
I just don't wanna
pay the damn bill.

366
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,196
It's not too bad in here,
all things considered.

367
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,363
That's 'cause
we in the shade.

368
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,567
When you get outside a couple
hours from now on that pavement,

369
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,974
fry your damn dick off
from three feet below.

370
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,309
Must be bad
over that grill.

371
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,645
I can't tell the
difference no more.

372
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,409
I tell you what, though,

373
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,512
stuff goes down around here
when the mercury pop 100.

374
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,916
Man who beat
his wife at home

375
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,494
will beat her right
out on the street.

376
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,995
Brings out the animal in us.
It ain't no joke.

377
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,697
What used to wake me up?

378
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,528
Gunshots.

379
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,830
Now you know what does?

380
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,102
People fucking.

381
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,339
Meaning and screaming like
goddamn cats in the alley.

382
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,742
You know what they say,

383
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,407
"When you get hot and sweaty,
it make you ripe and ready.“

384
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,350
Hey- H”

385
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,458
I drank too much.

386
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,795
We both did.

387
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,961
Last night didn't happen.
I know.

388
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,269
When I walk out that door,
it's business as usual.

389
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,567
No special treatment.

390
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,633
Don't worry. You won't
need a restraining order.

391
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,414
I'm surprised you didn't
go for the waitress.

392
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,884
You're much sexier.
Yeah, okay.

393
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,782
She works for tips.
You run Congress.

394
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,256
Only half of it. That's
half more than she does.

395
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,225
So it's not my body.

396
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,124
Those legs don't hurt.
You're so full of shit.

397
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,230
Okay. It's your voice.

398
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,428
My voice?

399
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,833
Hmm.

400
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,274
It does something to me.

401
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,146
Let me know what
Tusk has to say.

402
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,148
Business hasn't started. You
haven't walked out that door yet.

403
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,582
Watch me.

404
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,325

405
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,094

406
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,665

407
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,345
Thank you, Jackie.

408
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,723
We're going to
the White House.

409
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,393
Littlejohn on the move.

410
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,863
We raise the bet.
We get FERC involved.

411
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:37,900
An investigation?

412
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,197
We don't need Congress to activate
the Regulatory Commission.

413
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,363
But a price-fixing review?
That would take months.

414
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,532
Again, it's the threat,
not the actuality.

415
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,200
He'll employ the same logic.
Draw it out.

416
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,402
Fight back with appeals.

417
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,480
But he'll have to divulge his
accounting if FERC takes action.

418
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,210
Now, no businessman
wants to open up his books,

419
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,410
especially one
with $43 billion.

420
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,487
This is getting
out of hand, Frank.

421
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,580
We shouldn't be duking
it out with Raymond.

422
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,056
Maybe we should talk to him.
That's exactly what he wants,

423
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,889
to force himself
back into the mix.

424
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,759
What's to be gained
by shutting him out?

425
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,024
The simple lesson

426
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:11,933
that you cannot strong-arm the
President of the United States.

427
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,737
We can't devolve
to a pissing contest

428
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,334
I'm gonna call Raymond.
Invite him to Washington.

429
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,240
He won't accept anything
but total surrender.

430
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,939
I'm making the call. Don't put
yourself in that position.

431
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,282
I know how to maintain
the integrity of my office.

432
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,577
Thank you. Thank
you, Mr. President.

433
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,184
Two minutes with
the President,

434
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,247
and Tusk may be back
in his good graces.

435
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,191
I need to disrupt the nuptials
and prevent a second marriage.

436
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,037

437
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,202
Christina?

438
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,242
Good to see you.
Oh, please.

439
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,283
You look great.

440
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,978
Thank you.

441
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,555
How are things?

442
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,954
Great.

443
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,457
Linda works me to the bone,

444
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,322
but that's what
I signed up for.

445
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,726
Well, from what I've heard,
you're doing a great job.

446
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,890
That's really
nice to hear.

447
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,730
Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Tricia.

448
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,996
I'm sure you've noticed

449
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,595
that she's still sort of
adjusting to her role.

450
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,107
You mean her confidence?

451
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,334
I think it would be great
if you reached out to her.

452
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,746
Just let her know that you're there
if there's anything she needs.

453
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,977
I don't really
know her that well.

454
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,416
I mean, we've met,
but I...

455
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,954
That's okay.
Maybe just tell her

456
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,512
that you enjoy working
for the President,

457
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,525
and you're there to be of help
to her in any way you can.

458
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,660
You don't think that's a
little, I don't know, brash?

459
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,958
How?

460
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,159
For me to just approach
her like that?

461
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,962
No. Not at all.

462
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>You've reached
the Skorsky residence.</i>

463
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,919
<i>Leave a message
after the beep.</i>

464
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,879
Tom Hammerschmidt again.

465
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,750
Still trying to reach Janine.
Still important. Thank you.

466
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,327
 <i>Hammerschmidt's been calling
our press office all day.</i>

467
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,765
I don't want a story to come
out any more than you do.

468
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,770
We lose a major
asset if it does.

469
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,340
Can you squash it
for security reasons?

470
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,501
Not once it's been
shared with the press.

471
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,172
First Amendment crap. Ward isn't
making things any easier.

472
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,708
She wants a notch
in her belt.

473
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,512
We're giving her one.

474
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,016
Not Goodwin.
She wants Orsay.

475
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,057
Most Wanted list
for six years.

476
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,516
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

477
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,961
You need to make sure
Goodwin takes the plea.

478
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,555
If 35 with no parole doesn't
scare the piss out of him,

479
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,895
I don't know what will.

480
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,697
Then don't try
to scare him.

481
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,963
Remove hope from
the equation.

482
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,036
<i>I tried to
keep this contained.</i>

483
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,874
I didn't anticipate
Hammerschmidt.

484
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,912
 Is Ms. Skorsky
cooperating with him?

485
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,579
He's called her.

486
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,789
My guy at the Bureau said
they haven't actually spoken.

487
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,416
At least not
on the phone.

488
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,089
If this goes to court...
That won't happen, sir.

489
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,631
It will if he publishes.

490
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,259
I'm bringing this to you because
I can't control Hammerschmidt.

491
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,461
I don't know
what to do.

492
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,072
We need to invite
a full-frontal attack.

493
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,145
Then hold the line.
You want to speak to him?

494
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,915
Face to face.
Just the two of us.

495
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,776
I don't think that's
a good idea, sir.

496
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,082
You have a better idea?

497
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,350
No, sir.

498
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,360
We can't avoid the battle, but
we can choose the battlefield.

499
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,986
Set up a meeting
at the White House.

500
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,962
We'll intimidate him
with formality.

501
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,328
Yes, sir.

502
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,794
Mr. Vice President?

503
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,471
I know you don't have
patience for apologies,

504
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,009
but I'm sorry if I've let
you down in any way.

505
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,009
Let's concentrate on
what's in front of us.

506
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,179
I'll let you know when
I have a time set up.

507
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,146
Soon <i>as</i> possible.
Yes, sir.

508
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,799
So this is a sort of outline
to the larger piece?

509
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,963
With questions
on the next page.

510
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,077
We're off the record.
Yes. Off the record.

511
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,751
Now, Tom, I know that you
care about this young man,

512
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,849
and I respect you as a journalist.
But these questions?

513
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,155
Why don't you
just ask me

514
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,823
when I stopped
strangling people's pets?

515
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,263
Sir, the death
of Congressman Russo...

516
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,164
You mean, my friend,
Peter Russo,

517
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,501
whose suicide left two small
children with no father.

518
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,500
No, I will not answer questions about that.

519
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,411
Yes? I'm aware of that.

520
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,275
No, tell her I'll
call her right back.

521
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,174
Two minutes.

522
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:00,915
Secretary Durant.

523
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,282
I can wait outside...
No, let's finish.

524
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,889
Now, if you decide
to print any of this,

525
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,119
assuming you find an
outlet that's willing to,

526
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,424
then, yes, it might cause
me a headache for a day.

527
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,758
But I will not engage.

528
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,428
And I think it
will only prove

529
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,899
to highlight how ridiculous
Mr. Goodwin's claims are.

530
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,200
I pity him. I truly do.
I think he needs help.

531
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,639
I've interviewed many mentally ill people.
He's not one of them.

532
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,944
Well, I would suggest that you
read your own article again.

533
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,138
He's distressed.
There's a difference.

534
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,270
Look, I understand.

535
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,611
It must be a terrible blow
to see him in prison.

536
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,946
But, Tom...
Rachel Posner exists.

537
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:37,948
I haven't been
able to find her,

538
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,989
but I've proven
she's not a fantasy.

539
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,422
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak.
These people were born.

540
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,791
They have Social Security
numbers, past addresses...

541
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,885
And so does everyone
from California to Maine.

542
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,454
Have I conspired
with all of them?

543
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,000
You have to admit there are some
troubling details regarding the DUI.

544
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,136
You know, people say the
same thing about Area 51.

545
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,071
You can conjure up little gray
men if you really want to.

546
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,007
Did you kill
Peter Russo?

547
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,179
Tom, you 're
embarrassing yourself.

548
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,811
Did you kill
Zoe Barnes?

549
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,975
I've given you more time
than this nonsense deserves.

550
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,416
I have to ask
these questions.

551
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,612
Well, the only
question I would ask

552
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,247
is does this sort of article
hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?

553
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,815
You have to do what
you think is right.

554
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:16,949
But I hope you
can understand

555
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,689
if I don't demean myself by
taking any of it seriously.

556
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,129
I appreciate your time,
Mr. Vice President.

557
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,171
How did it go?

558
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,178
I did my part. Now
put it to bed, Doug.

559
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,515
I won't submit myself to
this sort of exposure again.

560
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,644
Yes, sir.

561
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,281
Has Tusk met with
the President yet?

562
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,825
Linda said they're
meeting at 4:30.

563
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,157
Call Remy. Make sure he doesn't get
on his plane before I see him.

564
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,628
I'm on it.

565
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,666

566
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,544
Oh, Mrs. Walker?

567
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,546
I just wanted to say
how rewarding it's been,

568
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,741
working here
in the West Wing.

569
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,479
And I'm so proud to be
working for your husband.

570
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,879
Thank you.

571
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,719
I know he appreciates
all your hard work.

572
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,690
Well, now that I'm working
so closely with him,

573
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,892
if there's anything
I can do for you,

574
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,158
anything that would make
yours or his life easier...

575
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,492
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

576
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,097
Truly, anything.

577
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,406
I want you to know you can
rely on me, both of you.

578
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,707
I know that.
Thank you, Christina.

579
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,338
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.

580
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,515
Here. Let me.
It's just my hands.

581
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,218
Are they bothering you?
Yeah.

582
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,625
Probably gonna
get rain tonight.

583
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,923

584
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,053
I'll get it.

585
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,759
Um, no. Just keep
the broth moving.

586
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,440
Agent Green, FBI. Do you
have a moment, Ms. Skorsky?

587
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,477
Yeah. I...
May we come in?

588
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,308
I just need to
turn the stove off.

589
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,642
Stay in here, Mom.

590
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,049
Who is it?
Just stay in here.

591
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,217
Only that once?

592
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,159
And I haven't seen him since
or returned his calls.

593
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,627
How many times has he
tried to call you?

594
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,494
I don't know. Eight
or nine times, maybe.

595
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,126
And then he stopped
after a while.

596
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:43,138
Did he mention anything about
HEROnymous Bot or Gavin Orsay?

597
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,435
You know, I think I
should talk to a lawyer.

598
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,773
Right now, you're not suspected
of being an accomplice.

599
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,404
If you call a lawyer,
we might have to reconsider.

600
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,517
He mentioned some hacker.
HEROnymous.

601
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,953
I told him I thought it was
a bad idea to contact him.

602
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,654
Are you aware of what
he's claiming? No.

603
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,455
That you and he were
working together.

604
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,097
That you believe in
this conspiracy theory.

605
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,794
That it was you who received
explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.

606
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,631
Is any of that true?

607
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,506
We need you to come
back to D.C. with us

608
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,878
and sign this statement in the
presence of the US Attorney.

609
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,878
You want me to call him a liar.
Isn't he?

610
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,651
I can't do that to him.

611
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,453
We also need you to speak
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

612
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,994
You know what? Please, can
you just keep me out of this?

613
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,995
I had nothing to do with
the hacker or the...

614
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,496
Ms. Skorsky, we want
to believe you,

615
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,363
and we will if you put
all of it in writing.

616
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:49,030
He's not a criminal. You're
going after the wrong person.

617
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,129
And if you think that
you can intimidate me,

618
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,233
harass me like this
in my own home,

619
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,038
I will file
a formal complaint

620
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,340
You're starting to sound
an awful lot like him.

621
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,484
You can't arrest me.
I haven't done anything.

622
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,653
I'd like you to leave.

623
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,047
I have a right
to legal counsel,

624
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,556
and you haven't
presented a warrant.

625
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,718
We can arrest you,
Ms. Skorsky,

626
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,318
for abetting an act
of cyber terrorism.

627
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,389
Who's going to take
care of your mother

628
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,833
while you're spending the next
three years in courtrooms?

629
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,593
Would you please raise your arms?

630
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,503
No, Meechum.
Sir...

631
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,044
Meechum. I know you don't
want to shake my hand,

632
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,170
so we'll just
skip that part.

633
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,244
The President didn't
mention anything about ii.

634
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,752
Why would he? Better to
catch you off-guard.

635
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,515
Then why would you?

636
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,388
So we can avoid
unnecessary conflict.

637
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,057
Garrett's not
a good liar.

638
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,095
The gift of
a good liar

639
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,530
is making people think
you lack a talent for lying.

640
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,398
I know him far
better than you,

641
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,370
and so I know what
talents he has and lacks.

642
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,271
But let's assume
he did lie.

643
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,273
I'm not intimidated
by a FERC investigation.

644
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,875
You'd have grid overload
and brownouts

645
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,244
before you could
even get a hearing.

646
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,978
You are deliberately keeping
electric prices at inflated rates,

647
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,054
which is illegal.
No.

648
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,154
I'm responding
to free market.

649
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,122
A regulated free market.

650
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,922
Why are you
doing this, Frank?

651
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,292
Remy asked me
the same thing.

652
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,789
You're making
this about me.

653
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,232
This isn't personal,
Raymond.

654
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,128
The integrity of our energy
markets is my only concern.

655
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,638
Of course it's personal.

656
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:35,139
I asked you personally to convince
Garrett to pull back from China.

657
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,304
You personally
chose not to.

658
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,643
You personally
sabotaged the summit.

659
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,308
And you advised the Cabinet...
I've never once in my career...

660
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,681
...to push me up
against the wall...

661
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,947
...allowed personal
feelings to...

662
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,958
Do not try and spin me, Frank.
lam too old to tango.

663
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,419
Then I'll be blunt.

664
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,587
Accept the subsidies
or deal with FERC.

665
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,028
There is no third way here.

666
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,030
Are you intentionally trying
to destroy the President?

667
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:02,428
I'm trying to protect
the President from you.

668
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,539
This is about the Secretary of
State nomination, isn't it?

669
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,940
I'm the Vice President
now, Raymond.

670
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,002
I don't cry over what
happened in kindergarten.

671
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,343
You're Vice President
because I vouched for you.

672
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:17,147
Because you had no other options.
Political necessity.

673
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,182
You have 24 hours
to decide.

674
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,123
I'll show myself out.

675
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,858
Hello.

676
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,526
Raymond, this is Claire.

677
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,704
Mrs. Underwood,
it is an honor.

678
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:43,508
Jean, my wife, has been very
taken with your recent efforts.

679
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,876
Well, I'd like to
meet her one day.

680
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,846
She would very much
like that, I'm sure.

681
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,512
And what about you?

682
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,814
I'm sorry?

683
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,481
What are your thoughts
about our recent efforts?

684
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:59,154
I am in favor of anything that
prevents unnecessary violence.

685
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,755
It was nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

686
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,926
And good luck with that first pitch
tonight, Mr. Vice President.

687
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,164
Make it to the plate
this time.

688
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,268
Ma'am.

689
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,037

690
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,623
This Kevlar is cooking me.

691
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,856
We have to use it, sir.

692
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,398
Well, l didn't
practice with it,

693
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,434
and now I can
hardly rotate my arm.

694
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,866
I should have mentioned it.
I apologize.

695
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,097
If this ball doesn't make it
over the plate, it's your ass.

696
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,034
And what are you doing here?
Don't you have things to do?

697
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,872
Never been to
Camden Yards.

698
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,556
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, hereto throw
out the first pitch tonight,</i>

699
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,588
<i>we are honored to introduce</i>

700
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,657
<i>the Vice President of the
United States, Frank Underwood.</i>

701
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,065

702
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,474
Boss, boss.
Meechum's ball.

703
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,521
Thank you very much.
Where's the mascot?

704
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,118
Beautifully done.

705
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,319
<i>Good evening.</i>

706
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,795
<i>Now I know it's
a hot night,</i>

707
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,491
<i>and you all want to
get to the baseball.</i>

708
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,995
<i>So as soon as I
throw this sucker,</i>

709
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,263
<i>grab a drink,
enjoy the game,</i>

710
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,930
<i>and best of luck
to both teams.</i>

711
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,535
<i>Scratch that. We're at Camden Yards.
Go, Orioles!</i>

712
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,171

713
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,507
Let's go! Move!

714
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,019
Go, go!

715
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,322
 <i>I'm told
the distribution line</i>

716
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,556
that controls the pinch
point caused the outages.

717
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,063
BAPCO, one of
your companies.

718
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,030
 <i>Yes, sir. There
was a capacity issue.</i>

719
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,262
<i>We're working as quickly
as we can to resolve it.</i>

720
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,837
I've got three
governors calling.

721
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,531
Hospitals on
emergency power.

722
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,664
So quickly better
mean quickly.

723
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,006
<i>The latest estimate I got was two
to three hours, maybe sooner.</i>

724
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,602
Raymond, was
this intentional?

725
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:08,744
Sir, I know you don't hold me in
the highest regard at the moment.

726
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:14,616
But I am alarmed that you could
even entertain such a thought.

727
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,091
<i>Yeah, well, the timing makes
coincidence hard to swallow.</i>

728
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,853
There is a heat wave.

729
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,524
That always pushes
the grid to its limits.

730
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,895
<i>All right, let's get the
people out of the dark.</i>

731
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,628
Updates every 30 minutes
on your progress.

732
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,430
<i>I should inform you, sir,</i>

733
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,598
that I may need to take two
of my plants offline tomorrow

734
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,801
<i>for unscheduled maintenance.</i>

735
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,606
Why? Which ones?
Georgia and Tennessee.

736
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,307
<i>This blackout has put a great
deal of stress on them.</i>

737
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:44,410
My engineers are concerned about
the seals on the fuel rods.

738
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,819
So we're looking at outages
on the southeast grid, too?

739
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,391
<i>Could be. For a few days.</i>
No, that's unacceptable.

740
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,591
Safety comes first.
We don't want an accident.

741
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,994
All right, let's get a full
report to Linda, ASAP.

742
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,088
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

743
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,959
He's toying with you.

744
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,265
No, this could be
a legitimate safety issue.

745
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,432
He wants a seat back at the table.
Those plants are fine.

746
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,496
Why is he doing this?

747
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:06,597
We've had our differences,

748
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,507
but something
drastic like this?

749
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,910
Well, I did tell him about
the possible FERC action.

750
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:13,939
You did what?

751
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,814
Well, he called me.
I answered the call.

752
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,250
Why didn't you
inform me immediately?

753
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,580
He told me you had
a productive talk.

754
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,282
That he was on board
with the subsidy.

755
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,519
I assumed
everything was fine.

756
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,922
He was proposing
renewed trade talks.

757
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,428
We didn't talk about
the subsidy at all.

758
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,662
He's playing
both of us then.

759
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,667
If he told you he was on board,
why'd you bring up FERC?

760
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:33,758
I told him
I was relieved.

761
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,327
That we could have taken
action if he didn't comply.

762
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,633
You think he's fishing? To see
what our next move might be?

763
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,833
I think so, sir.

764
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,275
I mean, he is lying about those
two plants in the south.

765
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,142
Well, we can't guess.
We have to be certain.

766
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,614
Well, do you want Raymond
Tusk to assess that risk?

767
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,516
Or the United States
government?

768
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,517
Are you suggesting we
take over his facilities?

769
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,186
There is precedent there.

770
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,389
Woodrow Wilson did it with the
rail roads for three full years.

771
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,823
In a time of war.

772
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,558
In a time of emergency,
which is what this is.

773
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,531
The country needs a leader,
Mr. President. Give them one.

774
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,535
Do not bend to
Raymond Tusk.

775
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,803
<i>I'm done.</i>

776
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,718
I said you might not like it.
It <i>makes</i> me seem crazy.

777
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,653
<i>This is the most
toned-down version.</i>

778
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:31,159
<i>I tried to be as kind as I
could without being biased.</i>

779
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,321
I don't think you want this
going out into the world.

780
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,258
<i>Can I talk to Janine?</i>

781
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,497
<i>Tell him to go.</i>

782
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,541
He wants you to leave.

783
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,925
You lied.
<i>Lucas...</i>

784
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,461
You lied to Tom. You
lied to the US Attorney.

785
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,122
<i>I didn't knew what else to do.
Tell the truth.</i>

786
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,962
<i>They'll arrest me.</i>

787
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,226
They'll discredit
everything I say.

788
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:18,274
And nobody is going to believe
me more than they believe you.

789
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,865
<i>But we can get the story out there.
Get people asking questions.</i>

790
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,937
No. It'll just look like two
crazy people instead of one.

791
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,883
<i>So you're saving yourself.</i>

792
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,087
<i>I'm trying to save
the both of us.</i>

793
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:42,295
Please. Take the plea.
I'm not guilty.

794
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,964
You are.

795
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:47,059
You committed a crime,
multiple crimes.

796
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,292
<i>Not murder.</i>

797
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:55,578
Take the plea. Be good.
Get out early.

798
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,243
<i>Everybody's fucked me.</i>

799
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,281
<i>If I was trying to fuck
you, I wouldn't be here.</i>

800
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,356
<i>He's gonna get away
with it, isn't he?</i>

801
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:17,159
<i>Yes. He is.</i>

802
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,309

803
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,943
Take an iced tea if you have any.
We don't.

804
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,214
I wish I didn't
have to keep coming

805
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,288
through back doors
like this.

806
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,949
Well, we wouldn't want our
friends in the fourth estate

807
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,492
to know you were
here, would we?

808
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,721
Especially, since you've
gone to such lengths

809
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:49,525
to remain above
the fray of politics.

810
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,400
You can't seize
the plants, Frank.

811
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,060
We haven't
seized anything yet.

812
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,469
We're ready to, but we
won't if you cooperate.

813
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,804
It's illegal.
It's not. You know that.

814
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,711
The President can issue an executive
order in times of emergency.

815
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,836
I'll fight it in court.

816
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,246
Which will take even longer than
a FERC investigation would.

817
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:11,150
And in the meantime, you make
nothing from those plants.

818
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,546
We agreed.

819
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,915
Right here in this room,
we agreed to work together.

820
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,721
We agreed as
men of our word.

821
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,318
And I held up my end
of that bargain

822
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,829
until you abandoned
me on the bill...

823
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,229
I sent Remy to help you.

824
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:25,597
After I got it passed through the
Senate with no help from you.

825
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,863
I had to protect my relationship
with the President.

826
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,337
And then you tried to use me
during the summit in Spotsylvania.

827
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,609
I was not put on this earth
to be your best friend

828
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,344
or to share every piece of
information I have with you.

829
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:44,518
We agreed to a mutually beneficial
partnership. That's all.

830
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,083
Yes, and what's become
very clear to me

831
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:53,594
is that I benefit in no way
from this partnership.

832
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,857
Let's not pretend
to be naive.

833
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,527
We both respect self-interest
above all else.

834
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,067
Our versions of that
no longer align.

835
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,870
You are on the
verge of making

836
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,607
an irreversible mistake,
Mr. Vice President.

837
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:15,707
I may well be making
a mistake. Who knows?

838
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,317
What I do know is that
you'll be calling Linda

839
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,891
and telling her that you'll
accept the subsidies.

840
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,551
You may have all
the money, Raymond,

841
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,423
but I have all
the men with guns.

842
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,490
It's a burner, pre-dialed.
She's expecting.

843
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,729
And yes, from last night.

844
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,998
"The hall's in your
court," as they say.

845
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,629
Jesus Christ. You scared
the shit out of me.

846
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,590
Are you supposed to take the
Lord's name in vain like that?

847
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,367
Leave it on.
It costs too much.

848
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,699
I'll take care of it.

849
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,037
Goodwin took the plea.
He's going away.

850
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:22,182
So does that mean
this is all over?

851
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:25,686
No. We still
have to be careful.

852
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,279
But why? If he's gone, then
nobody's looking for me, right?

853
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,848
Not that we know of.

854
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,688
Until we know,
nothing changes.

855
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,693
So what, you just came over
here to get my hopes up?

856
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,061
I came here to make sure that
you don't go to church tonight.

857
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,069
Do you want to fuck me?

858
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:55,411
Is that what this is all about?
No.

859
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:58,487
You've done it before.
That was different.

860
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,662
Stop it.

861
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,238
If there's one thing I know,
it's when a man wants me.

862
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,284
I learned who Rachel
was in church.

863
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,360
She was young
and beautiful.

864
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,361
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb.

865
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,399
And she became his wife

866
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,869
after he worked seven years
to earn her hand in marriage.

867
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,207
Rachel had one son, Joseph.

868
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,242
He became a king.

869
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,045
Are you hungry?
\
