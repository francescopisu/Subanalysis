 She's getting
her sea legs,

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,750
but I've been happy so far.

15
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:49,827
She works hard.

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,884
It's a big load
off my shoulders

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,828

the President instead of me.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,697

when I stay here.

19

preference in the Whip's race?

Can't believe
how ugly it's gotten.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,905
He's more disappointed
than anything else.

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,499
Watch out, Wes.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,341
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Not at all.

25
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,539
This is something else.

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,912
Security specs.
They had to work fast.

27
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,347
It's like a war zone
around here.

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,852
The idea is to keep
the war from getting in.

29
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,683
How's the Whip's race
coming, Congressman?

30
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,120
It's tight between
you and Howard?

31
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,451
Well, you'd have
to ask Howard,

32
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,026
if he's not too busy
trying to sodomize me.

33
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,060
Just say hello.

34
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,754
For God sakes, don't make
me talk to that man.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,587

36
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,368

37
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,528

38
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,065
Yeah. I bet it is.

39
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,777
Bob.
Frank.

40
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,379

What?

41
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,084
Thanks for inviting me. You bet.

42
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,919
Judge.

43
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,924
Good to see you.

44
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,794
Is there somewhere
I can go to change?

45
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,490
Yes, absolutely.
There's room down the hall.

46
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,000
Doug, will you take care
of the judge?

47
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,661
And when he's ready, let's
get this thing over with.

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,238
I'll start bringing 'em in.

49
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,331
 "...that I take
this obligation freely,

50
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,638
"without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion."

51
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,406
"...that I take

52
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,971

53

"And that I will well..."

54
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,913
One heartbeat
away from the presidency,

55
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,419
and not a single vote
cast in my name.

56
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,319
Democracy is so overrated.

57
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,415
"...office on which lam about
to enter, so help me God."

58
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,256
"And that I will
well and faithfully

59
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,091

of the office

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,621
"on which I am about to enter,

61
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,031

Mr. Vice President.

62
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,329

63
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,129

64
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,540
All right, let's get back
to running the country.

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,778
 Now, one of you is
gonna replace me as the Whip.

66
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,907
You're the two frontrunners,
and we know you both want it.

67
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:35,283
 And you're not behaving like
men who belong in the Leadership.

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,786
We need to tone down
the rhetoric.

69
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,217
You're hurting your party.

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,485
I'm just responding to the
lies Howard's been slinging.

71
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,560
Those junkets happened, Wes.
I'm not making it up.

72
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,754
 And nepotism's
any better.

73
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,160
 That's just not true,
and you know it.

74
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,287
 And your
sister's husband

75
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,626
just happened to be
appointed State Treasurer.

76
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,462
Ex-husband. And yes.

77
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,402
That is such
a load of crap, Howard.

78
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,937

Gentlemen, Bob is right.

79
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,269
This sort of cat-fighting
gets out in the press,

80
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,934
whichever one of you wins
hits the ground limping.

81
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,403
Let's keep it clean

82
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,003
and bring some civility
back to the House.

83
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,137
Can we agree to that?

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,746
I'd feel a lot better
if you shook hands on it.

85
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,958
Thank you.

86
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,527
I'm with him
right now, Christina.

87
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,663
I'm off. I'll swing
by your office later.

88
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,868
Don't. It's not ready yet.
I'll be working from here.

89
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,943
Tusk is in town.

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,603
He's meeting with the
President in 45 minutes.

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,669
Christina
just told me.

92
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,770
The Joint Commission talks.

93
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,838
That's what
she said.

94
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,110
Christina is
proving useful.

95
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,378
We'll stay
in touch.

96
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,952
Get me Cathy Durant.

97
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,351
Your people coming by?

98
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,683
Just my new
Chief of Staff.

99
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,621
That's all I've got
until we hire more.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,990
So how does it feel to be
married to the Vice President?

101
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,197
Exactly the same.

102
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,821
Just louder.

103
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,525
Secretary Durant.

104
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,057
Cathy.

105
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,366
Raymond.

106
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,075
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

107
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,804
Thank you very much.

108
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,405
May I please introduce
Secretary Durant.

109
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,675
Pleasure,
Madam Secretary.

110
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,910
Hi.

111
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,820
Well, this is
quite a surprise.

112
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,220
I had no idea
you were in town.

113
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,046
Huh?

114
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,826
Well...

115
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,678
Morning, sir.

116
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,769
Mr. President.

117
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,006
Catherine.

118
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,572
We just happened to run into Raymond.
Well...

119
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,747
Wonderful.
Come on in.

120
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,252
The phone records will
absolutely prove I'm right.

121
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,792
There were no phone records.
You know that.

122
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,623
The data history
with the carrier.

123
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,856
Even if we got the case reopened,
which isn't gonna happen,

124
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,593
do you have any
idea how hard it is

125
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,224
to get a warrant
for phone data?

126
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,032
Probable cause.
Bring him in for questioning.

127
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,537
Technically you
have jurisdiction.

128
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,766
The Vice President
of the United States.

129
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,307
I know this all sounds
preposterous to you,

130
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,535
but if you go
through my notes...

131
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,077
We've been
through your notes.

132
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,374
You've listened,
but you haven't heard me.

133
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,075
Circumstantial, yes,
but plausible.

134
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,981
I know you've
reopened cases on less.

135
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,613
This has gotta stop, man. We keep
having the same conversation.

136
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,657
It can't be
an accident.

137
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,586
Okay. I'm gonna
show you something.

138
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,731
CNN tried to get
a hold of this.

139
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,567
We 86'ed it out of
respect to the family.

140
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,072
The footage?

141
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,911
It's not easy to watch.

142
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,412
I want to see it.

143
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,482
She tripped
or jumped.

144
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,484
She didn't jump.

145
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,324
Here it is,
frame by frame.

146
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,945
Now, there were
two witnesses.

147
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,486
One was a 70-year-old woman
with macular degeneration.

148
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,542
All she saw was a blur.

149
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,144
The second was the
conductor of the train.

150
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,815
He said it looked
like she fell.

151
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,349
Between those two and this
video, that's all there is.

152
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,822
You can watch it a million
times, but this case is closed.

153
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,964
We should limit the agenda
to a couple of key issues.

154
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,634
Import tariffs on
industrial manufactured goods

155
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,644
and export quotas
on rare earth elements.

156
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,180
They're using both
<i>as</i> political levers.

157
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,240
I agree these are two areas where
we can make meaningful progress.

158
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,183
But I'm worried about the rise
in corporate cyber attacks.

159
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,513
That's a rabbit hole.

160
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,915
Well, we have to address it
sooner or later.

161
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,323
It's just a matter of whether
we want to address it now.

162
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,157
The Chinese
don't like surprises.

163
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,528
All I'm proposing is that we
use the Joint Commission talks

164
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,363
to bring it up gently now, set
the stage for the next round.

165
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,370
 Look, I'm a
businessman, not a diplomat.

166
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,769
But I'm a businessman

167
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,534
with 35 years' experience
working in China.

168
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,042
When they come to the table,
you don't get greedy.

169
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,875
You're working on a co-venture
refinery project in Fujian.

170
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,381
Which would be
the first of its kind.

171
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,941
Open the gateway
for increased investment.

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,748
Cyber attacks threaten
those co-ventures.

173
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,188
There's less a need for them if the
Chinese can obtain new technology

174
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,623
from corporate espionage.

175
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,784
Frank, what do you think?

176
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,589
I lean more toward
Raymond's thinking.

177
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,924
If we antagonize the Chinese,

178
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,861
we could undo
years of progress.

179
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,925
 Allow me to do this
quietly with a soft touch.

180
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,697
I won't antagonize them, sir.

181
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,069
The last thing we want to do
is rock the boat.

182
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,607
What do you
have in mind, Catherine?

183
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,575
A suggested agenda.
Not a demand.

184
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,312
We'll keep it mid-level.
I won't get anywhere near it.

185
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,373
 Raymond?

186
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,042
I've voiced my concerns.

187
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,751
A very soft touch.

188
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,120
You have my word, sir.

189
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,785
 Good.

190
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,230
Raymond?
Want to grab some lunch?

191
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,798
Would love to.

192
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,234
Thanks, Frank.
Welcome to the West Wing.

193
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,965
Thank you, sir.

194
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,971
The President is like
a lone tree in an empty field.

195
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,982
He leans whichever way
the wind is blowing.

196
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,987
And right now, Raymond Tusk blows
far too strong from the west.

197
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,519
Is that a wig?

198
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,822
No. He's been growing it out
for months.

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,857
Diane <i>says</i>
she likes it long.

200
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,193
I told her she'll
feel differently

201
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,461
once she sees
the first dreadlock.

202
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,435
Or smells it.

203
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,493
Oh!

204
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,967
I went to see your
daughter last weekend.

205
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:08,935
How is she?

206
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,340
You want to see
a picture?

207
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,641
Okay.

208
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,511
Was her mother there?
Yeah.

209
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,154
Are they okay on money?

210
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,522
The rate at Greenwoods
is going up in January.

211
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,727
Catalina is worried
she's gonna be short.

212
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,058
I'll make sure to put
more into the account

213
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,894
We don't have to talk about
her if you don't want.

214
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,025
No, no, no.
It's fine.

215
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,728
I appreciate you
going to see her.

216
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,328
I'm sorry, Ted. I thought that
when you asked me to lunch

217
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,963
it was because you want...
No, no, no.

218
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,843
I mean, yes, I want to make
sure they have what they need.

219
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,850
But no, the reason
I wanted to talk...

220
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,510
Lorrie Tate.

221
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,253
Lorrie's a friend of mine.
What about her?

222
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,052
She mentioned you're
interested in the Whip's race.

223
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,186
Oh, no. Ah!

224
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,724
I wish she hadn't.

225
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,199
Why not?

226
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,895
Because ifs ridiculous.

227
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,394
Is it?

228
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,106
I just mentioned
it off-hand.

229
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,440
The whole Webb and Buchwalter
thing is just...

230
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,570
Complete mess.

231
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,509
But I wasn't serious.

232
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,845
I think you
should be serious.

233
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,874
Do you want
to do it?

234
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,114
I don't have the
experience, Ted, and I...

235
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,350
Yes or no?
Yes, of course.

236
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,054
Someday. But now, I don't
have the money they do.

237
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,256
Unless you use mine.

238
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,627
You can't waste
your money on...

239
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,533
If I funnel my PAC money to some
folks who are on the fence,

240
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,368
round up a couple dozen
commitments before you announce,

241
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,466
that would make you
an instant contender.

242
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,976
Now tell me that's a waste.

243
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,046
We're talking
hundreds of thousands.

244
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,480
It's not
a Christmas present, Jackie.

245
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,776
With you as Whip,

246
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,442
I have a strong ally
in the Leadership.

247
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,247
I stand to gain
as much <i>as</i> you.

248
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,483
Hang on one second.
I don't know where the.“

249
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,561
<i>HOW did it go?
Did he buy it?</i>

250
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,966
Whatever bug you put
in his ear burrowed deep.

251
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,593
It was easy. That man adores
you like you're his own child.

252
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,469
But you sure as hell
better make me Chief Deputy.

253
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,131
I need to win first.

254
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,904
Ted and I make two.
111 to go.

255
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,001
It's always good

256
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,636
when the Chief Deputy
knows her arithmetic.

257
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,409
Fuck off. Let's
start taking names.

258
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,950
This one seems promising.

259
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,954
Connor Ellis. He's solid.
Good experience.

260
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,251
He's the one that got Senator
Jones out of that mess

261
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,314
with the push polling.

262
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,917
Yes. Kept him from
the Ethics Committee.

263
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,984
Let's set up
an interview.

264
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,927
I'll find a good time
in the schedule.

265
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,989
Let's talk about
the schedule.

266
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,832
I think we need to be more
selective with the events I do.

267
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,599
Some of these are leftovers
from Mrs. Matthews.

268
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,438
We can cancel
whatever you like.

269
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,977
And what's this?

270
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,842
Your husband will
be pinning stars

271
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,380
on two newly-commissioned
Marine generals.

272
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,115
I think that's one
you should do.

273
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,708
Okay. Walk me through it.

274
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,619
The generals are Alicia
Hampton and Dalton McGinnis.

275
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,122
Arriving at 6:50..

276
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,658
Dalton McGinnis?

277
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,523
Yes. Do you know him?

278
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,326
We went to
college together.

279
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,533
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

280
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,626
Arrive what time?

281
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,671
6:50.

282
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,402
Great. I'd like a list of all the
people that will be attending.

283
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,341
It's not that big a deal
if I get left out'

284
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,505
but you're
the Secretary of State.

285
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,845
I mean, Tusk should not
be determining policy.

286
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,374
The President alone should instruct
you on what you are to pursue.

287
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,977
What's their
relationship?

288
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,522
He's had his ear
for years.

289
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,816
An adviser...
More of a mentor,

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,985
and one whose advice
is not easily dismissed.

291
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,995
He's gonna keep pushing back
on cyber warfare.

292
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,325
Not if I get it
on the agenda.

293
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,492
No, especially if you
get it on the agenda.

294
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,159
Tusk is not gonna
take any chances

295
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,830
when the next Joint Commission
talks come around.

296
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,566
You agreed with him
in the meeting.

297
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,833
If we had ganged up,

298
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,603
he would have taken
a firmer position.

299
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,269
For all we know, he's convincing
the President right now

300
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,675
to change his mind.

301
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,239
Now we need to remove that
option as a possibility.

302
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,374
How?

303
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,780
Force the Chinese to confront the
issue now, this round of talks.

304
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,022
I promised the President
a soft touch.

305
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,857
I can't intentionally
break my promise.

306
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,260
What if it was
unintentional?

307
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,195
Cathy, if you don't like
how the table is set,

308
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,260
turn over the table.

309
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,243
You're cheating.

310
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,801
No, I'm not.
It's vapor.

311
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,473
Still.

312
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,608
You should try it. Addiction
without the consequences.

313
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,242
It's all yours.

314
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,745
You staying UP?

315
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,050
This ceremony
tomorrow night.

316
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,717
You don't
want to go.

317
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,591
If I don't have to.

318
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,392
I hate these
sort of things, too,

319
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,128
but it is my first public
appearance as Vice President.

320
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,965
Okay.
Thank you.

321
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,328

322
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,175
Should we turn this
into a proper office?

323
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,148
That's not a bad idea.
No privacy downstairs.

324
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,480
I'll talk to
the contractor.

325
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,113
Goodnight,
Francis.

326
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,314
Goodnight.

327
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,139
 Sir! Sir!
Congressional Record.

328
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,943
Weren't the talks
supposed to go until 6:00?

329
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,381
 We can't talk
if they won't listen.

330
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,780
Did the Chinese walk out?

331
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,877
We made it clear that we won't
discuss any other issues

332
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,616
until government-sponsored cyber
attacks are on the table.

333
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,157
Apparently, that's not
what they wanted to hear.

334
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,487
Sir, what did you
tell the Chinese

335
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,821
delegation before
they walked out?

336
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,123
<i> We didn't have
anybody there.</i>

337
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,289
The Joint Commission
is usually a snooze-fest.

338
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,525
Not today it wasn't.

339
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,793
I've got Greer on it.

340
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,528
Isn't this international?

341
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,864
We need somebody
from the tech beat

342
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,199
if we want any background
on cyber warfare.

343
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,466
Does he have anybody
on record yet?

344
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,507
The Chinese
aren't talking,

345
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,043
and all the US delegation said
is what's in the AP wire.

346
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,169
I want something online
in the next two hours.

347
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,542
In-depth follow-up
sometime this week.

348
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,849
Hey, Lucas?

349
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,813
You all right?

350
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,220
Yeah. Why?

351
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,490
You're wearing the same
clothes you wore yesterday.

352
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,221
Am n

353
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,562
I don't know what's going on
in your personal life,

354
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,566
but it seems to be
entering the workplace.

355
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,692
Appearances matter.

356
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,763
And we can't have an editor looking
more disheveled than his reporters.

357
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,365
Two hours.
You'll have something.

358
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,002
 Did you know Jackie
Sharp's running for Whip?

359
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,569
No, this is the first
I'm hearing of ii.

360
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,841
 I spoke to Webb.

361
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,780
He got an email
from Lorrie Tate about me.

362
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,715
I got one from Dave Holland
about him.

363
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:55,912
Which means
nothing to me.

364
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,352
The junkets,
the nepotism.

365
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,685
Tate and Sharp
are close.

366
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,520
Holland serves on
the VA Committee with her.

367
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,219
She used proxies
to insulate herself.

368
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,387
So you think that
she gave the dirt to them.

369
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,953
Yeah. She's been playing
both of us.

370
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,623
How many commitments
do you think she could have?

371
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,927
Around 20 so far.

372
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,228
So she's a distant third.

373
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,133
But she's picking people
off us left and right.

374
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,203
I want your help.

375
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,796
You have my support, Wes.

376
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,430
Then make that public.

377
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,033
If I come out for you,
Birch comes out for Webb.

378
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,806
That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
This is serious, Frank.

379
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,882
Ted Havemeyer is
bankrolling her.

380
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,211
Have you thought
of talking to Jackie?

381
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,980
No, no. I can't do
that on principle.

382
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,053
Why not?

383
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,056
Anyone who Havemeyer is
backing, I don't work with.

384
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,149
He pulled the same crap on me
when I ran for Senate.

385
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,784
He financed my primary
opponent. Asshole.

386
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,987
Well, that is your call.

387
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,156
But if you're gonna let an old
grudge get in the way of progress...

388
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,732
I just can't do it, Frank.

389
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,735
Havemeyer's been trying to shove
me down the totem pole for years.

390
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,236
I won't give him
the satisfaction.

391
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,399
Well, I can respect that,
but my hands are tied.

392
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,998

It's a delicate matter,

393
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,510
but we are in communication
with the Chinese government

394
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,601
as to how to move forward.

395
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,341
Does this mean the US will
back down on cyber attacks?

396
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,245
The United States
never backs down,

397
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,252
particularly on issues
that are high-priority to us.

398
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,083
 Madame Secretary...
 Thank you.

399
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,147
 What did you tell
the head of the delegation?

400
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,962
 The delegation
overstepped its bounds,

401
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,157
but Cathy couldn't throw her
own people under the bus.

402
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,927
 she should have consulted
us first before speaking publicly.

403
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,161
The press was
on her doorstep,

404
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,759
and the President was
in another hemisphere.

405
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,702
Now, look, I'm not
condoning what she did,

406
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,330
but she had
to do something.

407
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,670
She made a gut call,
and she acted.

408
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,608
We have to distance
ourselves from this.

409
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,509
When is the President back?
Tomorrow morning.

410
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,104
Can we setup
a meeting?

411
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,706
Cathy needs to
publicly apologize.

412
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,341
Can we get her in the room
with the President?

413
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,545
Shouldn't we all be
on the same page first?

414
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,553
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

415
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,783
Now, you asked me a question
before I went and got my food.

416
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,723
Mr. Vice President.
And I've forgotten what...

417
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,953
General McGinnis.

418
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,120
Ah! It's a great honor.

419
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,323
I hope you don't mind. The
President wishes he could be here.

420
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,297
He's asked me to fill in.
The honor is mine, sir.

421
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,130
And, General,
this is my wife, Claire.

422
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,636
It's good to
see you, Claire.

423
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,694
It's been
a long time.

424
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,795
Yes.

425
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,204
Harvard.
We were classmates.

426
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,639
Well, Claire
didn't say a thing.

427
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,143
Well, we dated
for a time.

428
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,304
Well, about
five minutes.

429
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,174
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your meal.

430
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,477
Thank you.

431
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,574
I've remembered.

432
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,550
Interestingly enough,
in South Carolina,

433
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,020
the largest crop
is not cotton.

434
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,024
No, it's tobacco.

435
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,856
And the third-largest crop
is marijuana.

436
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,887
Now, we'll just keep
that to ourselves.

437
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,761
Would you all excuse me
for just a moment?

438
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,662
 Is she alone?
Yes.

439
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,501
Would you give us
a few moments, please?

440
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,844
What's wrong?

441
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,580
It was him.

442
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,774
Who?

443
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,410
Freshman year.

444
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,049

445
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,923
You mean...

446
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,090
McGinnis?

447
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:58,099
Francis, Francis.
Please, don't do anything.

448
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,965
I am not gonna pin a medal on that man.

449
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,402
You have to.
Just a minute, please!

450
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,461
There is no way that man...

451
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,539
Sir, they wanna
start the ceremony.

452
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,597
Just a minute, please!

453
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,573
He does not deserve a medal.
Francis, I beg of you.

454
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,202
That man deserves
to be taken out and shot!

455
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,803
No.
Please! Do not...

456
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,540
I said just a minute!

457
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,743
Do not make
a scene. Please.

458
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,141
Tom.

459
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,583
Thanks for coming by.

460
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,587
You know,

461
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,596
I thought I would miss this place
the moment I stepped inside.

462
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,863
But I don't.

463
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,133
Hope you like Stella.

464
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,170

465
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,674
Cheers.
Here's how.

466
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,345
How are things?

467
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,680
They're good.

468
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,017
They're good.

469
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,387
You're happy?

470
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,663
I haven't been happy
a day in my life.

471
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,193
But I have time now
to think, to write.

472
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,164
Been working on a novel.

473
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,368
Yeah?
Mmm.

474
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,805
It's absolute shit.
That's okay.

475
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,148
That's great, Tom.
That's really great.

476
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,682
What's on your mind?

477
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,413
I know you didn't
ask me here just to catch up.

478
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,862
Frank Underwood.

479
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,673
<i>On the President's behalf,
it is my great honor</i>

480
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,871
<i>to formally recognize the selection
of General Alicia Hampton</i>

481
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,176
<i>as Commander, United
States European Command,</i>

482
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,874
<i>and General Dalton McGinnis</i>

483
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,351
<i>as Commander at the United
States Strategic Command.</i>

484
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,911
<i>The United States Marine
Corps has been well served</i>

485
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:36,687
<i>by these two
exemplary leaders.</i>

486
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,094
<i>The President and I are grateful
for their continued service.</i>

487
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,200
Congratulations.

488
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,435
Thank you, sir.

489
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,240
You think I'm insane?

490
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,080
I don't think
you're insane.

491
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,124
I think you've been
through a lot.

492
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,795
Trying to make sense of it all.
I know I'm right.

493
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,264
I'm sure you
believe you are.

494
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,494
It's a fact that
he helped cover up the DUI.

495
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,596
Imagine if one of your reporters
came to you with this story.

496
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,697
Could you print a word of it?

497
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,208
No, but I'd have them keep digging.
Would you?

498
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,642
If you're honest
with yourself,

499
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,146
wouldn't you tell them
it seemed farfetched?

500
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,443
Your notes aren't convincing.

501
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,882
The police reports
don't prove a link.

502
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,350
And the speculative leaps
you're making...

503
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,476
I know.

504
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,285
Hold yourself to the same
standards as you hold your staff.

505
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,192
You and Zoe were
seeing each other.

506
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,163
I'm assuming.
Maybe I'm wrong.

507
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,900
We were.

508
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,980
When I lost my first wife,
it didn't add up.

509
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,387
Who dies of
breast cancer at 31?

510
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,689
I wanted to sue.

511
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,989
Doctors,
the hospital, everyone.

512
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,161
Thought they were
hiding something.

513
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:57,857
No.

514
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,233
Grief demands an answer,
but sometimes there isn't one.

515
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,235
Her life couldn't
be saved. Period.

516
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,106
What do I do?

517
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,012
Would you consider
seeing someone?

518
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,384
There's a therapist
who helped me a great deal

519
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,117
when Cynthia passed away.
I can put you in touch...

520
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,385
No, I don't need to see somebody.
Lucas.

521
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,895
I appreciate you
coming by, Tom.

522
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,260
Thanks for the beer.

523
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,434
You call me anytime.

524
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,446
You take care
of yourself, Lucas.

525
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,582
I mean it.

526
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,057
Any plans
to go elsewhere, sir?

527
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,965
No. We're in
for the night. Thank you.

528
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,331
 Yes, sir.

529
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,634
Hey.

530
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,779
I'm tired.

531
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,859
Do you need
something, sir?

532
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,800
My remote.
I want to play.

533
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,703
It's right over here.

534
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,074
Thank you.

535
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,641
Is there something wrong
with the Internet?

536
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,743
I can't get online.

537
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,551
We had to disable the access.
It's not a secure connection.

538
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,841
Could you just
give me a moment, please?

539
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,678
Whenever you're out here,
somebody needs to be with you.

540
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,015
I can't be alone
in my own backyard?

541
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,249
If it were up to me, sir.
But it's not up to me.

542
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,879

543
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,086
Okay, Meechum.

544
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,305
You think I don't
want to smash things?

545
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,811
I know what that anger is
more than you can imagine.

546
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,183
When he was on top of me...

547
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,515
 We don't
have to talk about it.

548
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,112
No, I want to.

549
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,320
When he was on top of me,
I pressed my hand...

550
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,326
With everything I could,
I pressed it into his face.

551
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,034
I pressed it so hard
I broke his nose.

552
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,540
That didn't stop him.

553
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,110
He shoved the sheets in my mouth.
I could barely breathe.

554
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:53,696
Every time I think of her
pinned down like that,

555
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,466
I strangle her, Francis,

556
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,961
so she doesn't strangle me.

557
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,570
I have to.

558
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,307
We have to.

559
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,544
The alternative is“.

560
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,074
It's unlivable.

561
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,556
You should go to sleep.

562
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,562

I'm not sure if I can.

563
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,658
Then you should
go back downstairs.

564
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,285
You'll still feel the hate
in the morning.

565
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,250
You'll use that.

566
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,416
But not on him.

567
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,208
 What did you
communicate, exactly?

568
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,709
I told him to
bring up the agenda,

569
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,939
suggest bullet points for the
SED, but make no demands.

570
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,946
And how did that translate
into a direct ultimatum?

571
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,617
Well, sometimes my delegates
try to read between the lines.

572
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,052
They know that I need
plausible deniability

573
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,317
for diplomatic purposes.

574
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,550
Why didn't you
immediately recant?

575
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,320
In my experience
with the Chinese,

576
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,053
backpedaling
makes us look weak.

577
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,088
I had two choices.
Lose face or exhibit strength.

578
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,633
I chose the latter.

579
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,329
All right, Catherine.
I'll be in touch shortly.

580
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,062
Thank you, sir.

581
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,301

582
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,975
Get me Raymond
on the private line.

583
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,279
Do you think she overstepped
on purpose?

584
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,585
Cathy would never disobey
your orders. Not on purpose.

585
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,181
Raymond, I've got Frank here.

586
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,693
Just the three of us? Just us three.
Morning, Raymond.

587
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,258
My contacts in Beijing tell me

588
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,493
the Minister of Commerce
is in a tizzy.

589
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,860
<i> Wants to use this as an
excuse to start clenching fists.</i>

590
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,439
Well, either I turn my back on
Cathy, or I stand behind her.

591
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,473
<i>It's gotta be the former.</i>

592
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,509
I agree.
If you don't apologize,

593
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,340
<i>you go from ruffling feathers
to plucking them.</i>

594
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,706
And the Chinese won't stand
for that, Mr. President.

595
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,374
What about perceived miscommunication
between me and my Cabinet?

596
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,180
<i> Mr. President, right now
the goal is to resume the talks.</i>

597
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,481
I wouldn't worry
about perceptions.

598
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,782
<i>Frank is right.</i>

599
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,723
We need to be pragmatic.
Worry about appearances later.

600
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,623
All right. I'll have Catherine
draft an apology.

601
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,394
No, it has to come from you,
Mr. President.

602
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,968
If the apology is
to mean anything,

603
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,469
<i>it must come from
the White House.</i>

604
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,870
That is certainly
the more likely to succeed.

605
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,867
Fine. I'll do it then.

606
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,474
<i>Thank you, Raymond.</i>
Thank you' Garrett.

607
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,151
Do you hear how he still uses
the President's given name?

608
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,213
And that Walker doesn't flinch at
the lack of respect it implies.

609
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,389
Sir, forgive me
if this isn't the case,

610
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:14,930
but you seem
a bit hesitant.

611
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,521
Why do you say that?

612
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,568
Well, you've raised a good
point about public perception.

613
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:19,692
I don't want you to think

614
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,261
that I'm dismissing
your concerns casually.

615
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,396
No. It's a concern
for you, too?

616
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,543
There is some insight
into what Cathy brought up.

617
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,670
Backpedalling is weakness.

618
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,782
Well, it's always a coin
toss with the Chinese.

619
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:38,878
But sometimes standing your
ground is better than giving in.

620
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,791
They respect you more
when you show strength.

621
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,293
Are you changing your mind
on this, Frank?

622
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:50,264
I just think it's important that
you do what you think is best.

623
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,433
The American people
voted you President,

624
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,527
not me,
not Raymond Tusk.

625
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,237
I'll let you know
what I decide.

626
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,537
Thank you, sir.

627
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,576
You think
she's Underwood's choice?

628
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,778
He deflected,
so it's possible.

629
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,795
You and I, we need to work
together on this, Wes,

630
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:23,756
before we both get screwed.

631
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,960
I agree.

632
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:32,101
One of us drops out,
throws support to the other.

633
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,103
That'll dwarf
any following she has.

634
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,408
You want me to drop out.

635
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,609
I'll make sure you get my
Chairmanship on Appropriations.

636
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:48,322
All you can offer me
is Ethics, which nobody wants.

637
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,289
Let's put this to bed, Wes.

638
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,658
Webb must have
offered him a deal.

639
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,203
Then we have to offer
a better one.

640
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm guessing Appropriations.
There's no way I can top that

641
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,699
Except for Ways and Means.

642
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,640
I won't let you give your Chair
to an ass like Buchwalter.

643
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,547
If you're the Whip, you outrank
him and every other Chairman.

644
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,143
Screw committees. I'll have
a direct line to the Speaker.

645
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,620
Don't be stubborn, Jackie.

646
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,786
You think he'd take it?

647
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,484
He was willing
to take a deal from Webb.

648
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,850
But you're the only person
he hates more.

649
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,457
He's a brute,
but he's not an idiot.

650
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,469
Well, I know you're not
refusing out of loyalty.

651
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,636
 True.

652
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,313
So it's because of Ted.

653
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,979
You think you are hot
shit, don't you?

654
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,649
Can we set
egos aside

655
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,420
and talk business
like the adults we are?

656
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,152
I want more than
Ways and Means.

657
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,697
Tell me.

658
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,666
I want Havemeyer gone.
Not just retired.

659
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,266
Politically dead.

660
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,768
That race was
12 years ago.

661
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,040
That was 12 years I could
have been in the Senate.

662
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,879
Revenge?
Really?

663
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,052
Not revenge.

664
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,583
Equity.

665
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,757
Well, what are
you gonna do?

666
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,691
Buchwalter
won't budge.

667
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,723
You know, there's nothing I despise
more in life than pettiness.

668
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,702
I could approach Webb, but I
don't have enough to offer him.

669
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,296
He'd never drop out.
Too much pride.

670
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,033
I'm not sure
what to do.

671
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,203
This is my file on Ted.
An illegitimate daughter.

672
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,712
The nanny,
of course.

673
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,216
Her name is Emily Rodriguez,
19, cerebral palsy.

674
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,273
I know about Emily.

675
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,052
Well, then why are we
having this conversation?

676
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,420
It's complicated.

677
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:05,718
The daughter? It's very
black and white to me.

678
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,289
I've known Ted
since I was born.

679
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,922
He and my father
were very close.

680
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:10,989
Yeah, I'm aware.

681
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,762
He's always
looked out for me.

682
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,668
He got me into West Point.
He funded my first race.

683
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,740
I like Ted. He's always
been a team player.

684
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,742
It's unfortunate
he has this secret.

685
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,074
It was a mistake,
one he's always regretted.

686
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,942
After she was born, he asked
me to check in on her,

687
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,744
because he couldn't,
because he trusted me.

688
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,112
I see.

689
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,979
You came in here
knowing what you had to do,

690
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,751
hoping I would pull a
rabbit out of a hat,

691
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,918
so you wouldn't
have to.

692
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,688
I know the girl.

693
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,188
I know her mother. These
people don't deserve this.

694
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,823
I've given you
all I can.

695
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,367
Whatever you decide
is your prerogative.

696
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,527
But maybe I
misjudged you.

697
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:49,863
Ted is family to me.

698
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,703
An adopted daughter
in lieu of a real one.

699
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,334
Sir, the Secretary is here.

700
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,468
 Thank you.
Send her in.

701
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,311
Excuse us.

702
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,284
It's good.

703
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,349
GREER: Not too long?

704
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,622
A little bit,
but not much.

705
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,666
This part,
three paragraphs in.

706
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,825
About the phone companies?

707
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:18,959
Tell me more.

708
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,503
It's one of Homeland
Security's major concerns.

709
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,971
That the cyber attacks might
infiltrate phone carriers,

710
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,133
get access to millions
of people's data history.

711
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,232
Like who they called?

712
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,334
Yeah, who they called,
texted, what they texted,

713
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,971
when, where they were,
everything.

714
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,413
And that's possible?

715
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,814
There haven't been any
catastrophic breaches yet.

716
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,978
At least not reported.

717
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,349
But it looks like
the Chinese are starting

718
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,082
to recruit mercenaries
on the Deep Web

719
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,055
to launch guerilla-type attacks
that can't be tracked back...

720
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,147
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. The Deep Web.

721
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,249
I've heard of that.

722
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:47,353
Yeah, yeah. No, 96% of
the Internet isn't accessible

723
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,557
through standard search engines.
Most of it is useless.

724
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,828
But it's where you go to find
anything and everything.

725
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,495
Child porn,
Bitcoin laundering,

726
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,833
mail-order
narcotics,

727
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,929
hackers for hire.

728
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,234
How do you access it?

729
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,501
It's actually
pretty easy.

730
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,838
I could show you
if you want.

731
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,037
Yeah, I'm curious.

732
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,046
Mind if I...
Go ahead.

733
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,241
Okay, first thing
you need is TOR.

734
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,375
Some people prefer l2P,
but I think TOR is better.

735
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,044
What is TOR?

736
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,850
It protects you
through proxy servers.

737
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,515
Keeps you anonymous.

738
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,923
Then I'll show you how to get to
the posting boards and the IRCs.

739
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,859
But I gotta warn you,
be careful what you click.

740
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,023
Some crazy shit
there, man.

741
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,198
For too long, we've
danced on egg shells

742
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,795
regarding the issue
of cyber warfare.

743
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,872
<i>Now, Secretary Durant
acted on instructions</i>

744
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,377
<i>that came directly from me.</i>

745
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,611
<i>Now, if the Chinese
are not willing</i>

746
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,079
<i>to engage
in a meaningful dialogue</i>

747
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,777
<i>about intellectual properly
of American corporations</i>

748
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,251
<i>as well as this
deliberate targeting</i>

749
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,220
<i>of our government's
online infrastructure,</i>

750
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,917
<i>well, then that is proof
of a double-standard mentality</i>

751
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,256
<i>that we shall
no longer tolerate.</i>

752
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,762
<i>Our delegation to
the Joint Commission</i>

753
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,990
<i>on Commerce and Trade</i>

754
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,564
<i>was unfairly
accused and defamed</i>

755
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,161
<i>by representatives of
the United States government.</i>

756
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,969
<i>The People's Republic of China
will not be threatened</i>

757
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,637
<i>by derisive
and unsubstantiated claims.</i>

758
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,280
<i>As long as the White House
continues to behave this way,</i>

759
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:18,287
<i>any future bilateral trade
talks will be impossible.</i>

760
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,921
It caught me by surprise, too.

761
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,017
Did you say anything to him
after I hung up yesterday?

762
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,594
No. Have you
spoken to him?

763
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,152

<i>Yeah, a few minutes ago.</i>

764
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,689
He said he did what
he thought was right.

765
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,767
 <i>Well, there's nothing</i>
we <i>can do to combat that.</i>

766
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,326
He doesn't usually
go against my advice

767
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,870
without giving
me fair warning.

768
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,803
What are you suggesting,
Raymond?

769
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,805
He's easily manipulated.

770
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,442
Clearly, not in this case.

771
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,945
<i>We need to fix this.</i>

772
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,107
<i>And Pm counting on you
for that, Frank.</i>

773
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,174
Let me freshen your memory.
I don't owe you any favors.

774
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,446
<i>I promised to work with you,
not for you.</i>

775
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,716
And when it comes to China,
we both want the same thing.

776
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,051
So we need to work together.

777
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,217
<i>To convince Garrett
he should retract.</i>

778
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,386
To support the President
in the path that he's chosen.

779
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:02,124
While he continues
to antagonize them publicly.

780
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,360
While he continues to benefit
from a bump in approval ratings.

781
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,561
<i>A tough stance on
China is popular,</i>

782
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,729
<i>and we can use that
to our advantage.</i>

783
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,965
<i>Let's just be patient</i>

784
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,872
<i>and see if we can smooth things
over from back channels.</i>

785
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,136
If I don't see
any results,

786
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,575
you won't have
my patience for long.

787
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,413
That's understood.

788
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:19,846
Let me know what
Durant has to say.

789
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,212
Absolutely.

790
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,546
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

791
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,925
I thought he might balk
at taking a handout from me.

792
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,188
I'd call it more
than a handout.

793
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,494
Well, he's always
been the sort of man

794
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,535
who could be bought,
but never cheaply.

795
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,937
It's not the Chairmanship
that bought him, Ted.

796
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,666
What do you mean?

797
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,367
I'm telling you this
so that you have time

798
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,573
to call your wife and
prepare your statement.

799
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,023
What's my out? What
does he want from me?

800
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,583
There is no out.
He wants it to hurt.

801
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,119
You told him.

802
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,392
I just promised him that
I could make it happen.

803
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,601
You can't do this, Jackie.

804
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,131
The story's breaking tomorrow.

805
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,937
What part of it?

806
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,702
No names. Just that
you have a daughter.

807
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:23,143
Have you thought about what
this will do to Diane?

808
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,372
To our sons?

809
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,244
I hate myself for it.

810
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,539
But I'll get over that.

811
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,753
What about her?
Emily.

812
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,717
You can't even say
her name, can you?

813
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,779
Don't lecture me.

814
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,222
You've never been in
the same room with her.

815
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,783
She's had the best
treatment available.

816
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,760
Alone, hooked up
to machines,

817
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,559
surrounded by nurses
who punch out at dinnertime.

818
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,100
You don't know what
I've been through.

819
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,897
You? What about her?

820
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,664
I can't do more
than I've done.

821
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,740
That's bullshit, Ted.
You could've found a way.

822
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,503
I won't defend
myself to you.

823
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,441
Don't. Save that
for your wife.

824
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,075
This isn't to punish you, Ted.
It's simpler than that.

825
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,121
When I first encouraged
you to run for office,

826
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:09,249
it's because I sensed
how unstoppable you were.

827
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,853
But I never thought I'd have to
lie down on the tracks myself.

828
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,767
If you're going to put
my neck in the noose,

829
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,203
look me in the eye
while you do it.

830
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,783
I'm very grateful for all
that you've done for me.

831
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,684
You'll make an excellent
Whip, Jacqueline.

832
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,120
Now please get out of my office.

833
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,336

834
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,136
What are you doing?

835
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,033

836
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,216
It's finally quiet.

837
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,389
It is, isn't it?

838
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,386
We have our fortress now.

839
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,833
Where are you
coming from?

840
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,927
My new office.

841
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,198
They just finished
setting it up today.

842
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,262
Do you like it?

843
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,205
It's an office.
It's fine.
