00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,579

Someone's being a bad boy.

5
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,013
"And do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God,

Forgiving one another."

Do you want me to keep going
with this or something else?

12
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,788
Doesn't matter to me. I just
like hearing you read it.

13
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:26,027
Doug, there's something
I need to talk to you about

14
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,046
You said that she was just
staying for a few nights.

15
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,642
Her roommate kicked her out. She
doesn't have anywhere else to go.

16
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,049
That's not
our problem.

17
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,953
Well, I can't just
put her out on the street.

18
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,115
What's her name?

19
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,824
Lisa.
Lisa what?

20
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,826
You don't have
anything to worry about

21
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,420
Where is she now?
At the fellowship.

22
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,093
There's a sleepover with some
of the kids in the daycare.

23
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,598
Does she know about me?

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,563
No. I haven't
told her anything.

25
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,104
I have given you space.

26
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,007
I trusted you, Rachel,
and you've taken...

27
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,099
I'm not kicking her out.

28
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,939

29
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,740
I could've said nothing,
but I told you.

30
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,184
I have to go.

31
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,622
She better be gone
by the next time we talk.

32
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,505
You want me to brief commerce...
 Sir.

33
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,278
What took you so long?

34
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,716
I can have a briefing ready
for you in five minutes.

35
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,115
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.

36
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,814
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.

37
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,653
Mr. President,
after you.

38
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,784
I'll see you
in my office.

39
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,223
<i>Japanese sovereignty
is a matter of precedent.</i>

40
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,665
Mr. Prime Minister,
my concern is escalation.

41
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,364
<i>Well, Fm asking for a small
portion of the Seventh Fleet.</i>

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,337
<i>We must bring
China into line.</i>

43
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,501
<i>Show them that the US and Japan
maintain a strong alliance.</i>

44
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,068
Have you reached out directly
to Beijing?

45
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,910
<i>No recognition that the
island belongs to Japan.</i>

46
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,075
Well, I'd like to speak to my
team and formulate a plan.

47
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,585
<i>Thank</i> you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Mr. Prime Minister.

48
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,985
Admiral,
for those catching up.

49
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,591
Two Chinese destroyers
entered waters

50
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,355
within three miles
of Yonaguni Island

51
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,988
here, approximately
six hours ago.

52
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,533
You can see how close
the island is to Taiwan.

53
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,092
Now this is different than the
standoff over the Senkaku Islands.

54
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,569
It could have to do
with shipping routes.

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,661
 Or the trade war.

56
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,071
They can't pick
on the big kid.

57
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,505
so they're picking
on the little one.

58
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,942
Did you see that?
What?

59
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,034
In the alley.
Camera two.

60
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,778
All units. White male,
hooded sweatshirt

61
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,216
Duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair Street.

62
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,609

63
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,581
Put down the bag.

64
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,417
<i>Put down the bag and place
your hands on your head.</i>

65
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,445
Stay right where you are.

66
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,124

67
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,559
Mrs. Underwood? Will you
come downstairs, please?

68
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,964
Where's Francis?

69
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,161
He got delayed
at the White House.

70
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,102
There was
an emergency meeting.

71
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,468
What's going on? I'll
explain in the safe room.

72
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,706
 The Seventh Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.

73
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,438
We could have ships to
Yonaguni in less than a week.

74
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,376
But even sending them
in that direction

75
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,244
will be picked up
by the Chinese satellites.

76
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,613
We have to stand with our allies.
That can't be in question.

77
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,243
What if we don't send ships?
Just make a strong statement

78
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,879
condemning their excursion into
Japan's territorial waters.

79
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,785
We still have to offer
the Chinese an incentive

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,915
to call back their destroyers.

81
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,622
Whatever overtures we make,

82
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,354
I'd like lo have
contingency plans in place.

83
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,621
Already drafting them, sir.

84
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,790
Cathy, open up a diplomatic
channel with Beijing.

85
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,299
See if there's
a concrete ask.

86
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,734
If they don't have one, let's
create a list of options.

87
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,027
Right away, sir.

88
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,939
How about coordination with
the Japanese navy?

89
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,065
Go.

90
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,039
Don't engage
with their navy yet.

91
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,045
I want to talk directly
to Prime Minister Oshiro

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,240
and express our intentions.

93
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,981
Former Marine.

94
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,282
He showed up at
the outer perimeter

95
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,084
with explosives
in a duffel bag

96
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,148
and strapped to his body. Jesus.

97
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,228
We apprehended him.
The press isn't aware.

98
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,627
Well, let's keep it that way.
He claimed he was responsible

99
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,063
for sending the package of
white powder to the Capitol.

100
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,000
So this time he really wanted
to take me out for real.

101
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,468
Not exactly.

102
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,396
His wife got an abortion
last week without telling him.

103
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,439
Oh, my God.
It was me.

104
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,734
Yes, you were
the target.

105
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,781
We'd like to keep you down
here with us, Mrs. Underwood,

106
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,816
until we can confirm
he was acting alone.

107
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:52,849
I'll stay.

108
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,282
No. You have to get back
to the White House.

109
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,649
No, but I can
work from here.

110
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,189
Francis, I'm fine. Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.

111
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,192
I want you to stick
with her at all times.

112
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,023
Keep me informed
of everything.

113
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,188
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent...

114
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,526
No, I want it
to be Meechum.

115
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,191
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.

116
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,136
I'll be back as soon <i>as</i> I can.
Okay. It's okay.

117
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,223
 Don't go to California.

118
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,986
Hmm, it'd be
nice to be reelected.

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,993
 You're gonna win.

120
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,526
Not if I don't give
the voters more face time.

121
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,811
When'd you get it?

122
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,019
The Army?

123
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,717
Yeah. it's grown since then.

124
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,157
Tell me about it.

125
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,856
No.

126
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,731
Why not?

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,930
I don't want to.

128
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,943

129
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,045
What are you doing?

130
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,278
Tell me about the tattoo.

131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,290
Mmm.

132
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,390
That's not fair.
So what?

133
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,928
You think you can just get me
wet and I'll spill everything?

134
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,400
I think so.

135
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,894

136
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,106
I know so.

137
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,439

138
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,584
Tell me.

139
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,753
I like the pain.

140
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,829

141
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,556
Of the needle?

142
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,594
Yeah.

143
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,235
How bad
did it hurt?

144
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,101
It hurt a lot.

145
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,639
You like when it hurls?

146
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,977

147
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,683
I killed a lot of people.

148
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,420
What?

149
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,129
In the Army.

150
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,131
The pain,

151
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,803
it helped.

152
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,376
Finish.

153
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,042

154
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,684
Most I could find was some
wrangling with the EPA

155
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,056
when he opened
his first plant,

156
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,561
but that was almost
40 years ago.

157
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,996
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.

158
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,666
Doyle and I
will keep looking.

159
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,827
If you haven't found anything now,
what makes you think you will?

160
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,902
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.

161
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,237
You think Tusk isn't planning his
next attack even as we speak?

162
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,744
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.

163
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,808
You want to shift tactics?

164
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,315
The casino. We go public
as soon as possible.

165
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,252
You said that was
a last resort.

166
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,981
Seth, you need to find
a way to make that happen

167
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,353
so it doesn't
link back to us.

168
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,587
 If we launch that missile,
it could blow us up, too.

169
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,560
Not if we spin it right.
If we keep the focus on...

170
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,689
Seth, you're here to listen.
Not contribute.

171
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,262
I wouldn't have him here if
I didn't want him to contribute.

172
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,198
Sir, he's been sitting
with this for three hours.

173
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,336
I've been working on it
for three months.

174
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,240
And accomplished nothing. Ifs
time we go on the offensive.

175
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,540
What are you thinking?
 Ayla Sayyad.

176
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,240
She's already digging
into Tusk and Feng.

177
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,943
How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino.

178
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,950
But now that I know
what the dots are,

179
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,045
I can see that she's
starting to connect them.

180
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,184
The Pentagon
isn't talking yet.

181
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,229
I imagine they're waiting
on the White House.

182
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,722
I hear there have been regular
meetings in the Situation Room

183
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,425
since last night.

184
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,731
Uh, let me
call you right back.

185
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,933
Hello? Hey, Lynn. It's Ayla.

186
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,971
I just sent you a picture.
Yeah, I got it.

187
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,471
What does it mean?
It's strange.

188
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,938
<i>It doesn't realty make sense.</i>

189
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,997
Tell me.

190
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,476
<i>"Pursue currency" would be
the most literal translation.</i>

191
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,240
<i>Or "pursue money"</i>

192
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,016
"Follow the money"?
That could work.

193
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,608
Thanks, Lynn.

194
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,036
I like what you've done. The sofa is new.
These lamps as well.

195
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,665
I've made a few changes.

196
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,203
Yeah, you get so used to a place,
the smallest things stand out.

197
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,178
I apologize for not
being responsive sooner.

198
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,874
I've been focused
on the midterms.

199
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,315
Oh, there's
no need to explain.

200
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,651
Mrs. Underwood, you know how
much I respect your intentions.

201
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,522
But I've thought
deeply about this,

202
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,995
and I can't co-sponsor
the bill in its current form.

203
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,657
Civilian oversight
is too extreme a step.

204
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,533
But I'd be happy
to revisit some

205
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,798
of the other, less
extreme proposals.

206
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,966
You think we're
being extremist?

207
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,333
I want to help
with this issue,

208
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,400
but this bill
goes against...

209
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,138
This bill is through
Armed Services.

210
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,842
This bill has a date
on the floor.

211
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,078
Almost every woman in the
House supports this bill.

212
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,983
And I can't
be one of them.

213
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,485
So you lied to us. I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.

214
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,826
I want to help. As long as we
rethink some of the language...

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,763
Are you trying to
distance yourself from us

216
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,391
because of
the Galloway scandal?

217
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,092
No.
Maybe you think

218
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,728
it hurts your chances of reelection
if you associate with me.

219
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,771
That's not it.

220
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,105
It's because I honestly don't
believe in this approach.

221
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,236
Do you realize
the message this sends?

222
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,576
The only woman in
Congressional leadership,

223
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,083
in both parties,
and you bow out?

224
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,682
If the bill goes to the floor
as is, I won't just bow out.

225
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,849
I'll actively fight it.

226
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,426
You never asked my position.
You assumed.

227
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,088
I can't imagine what
that position must be.

228
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,857
I've served
in war zones.

229
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,026
I know first-hand how
important chain of command...

230
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,797
We're not talking
about war zones.

231
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,769
We're talking about
sexual assault.

232
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,132
How about a military commission to
review the internal mechanisms...

233
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,075
We don't need more studies.
We need reform.

234
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,743
Well, let's continue
this conversation

235
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,612
when I return
from California.

236
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,819
I'll be back
the day after tomorrow,

237
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,947
if you change your mind.

238
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,089
I won't. But I hope
you change yours.

239
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,998
 China was insulted at
the notion we could buy them off.

240
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,402
Well, do I need to call
President Qian?

241
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,499
I doubt he would contradict
one of his ministers.

242
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,440
See if he's willing
to talk one-on-one.

243
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,500
You should know, sir,

244
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,171
Japan is also
preparing to deploy

245
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,271
three destroyers
and a light cruiser.

246
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,418
They're upping the ante.

247
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,643
Have Ambassador Hynes get in
touch with the Prime Minister.

248
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,849
Ask if Japan will hold off until
I've made contact with Beijing.

249
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,255
Yes, sir.

250
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,824
Have you gotten any rest at all?
No. Have you?

251
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,961
Not yet.

252
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,969
How's Claire?

253
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,364
The Secret Service thinks
it's an isolated attempt.

254
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,134
But they're
being cautious.

255
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,337
After the Galloway thing
and the interview,

256
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,880
half the country thinks she's a
baby killer or an adulterer,

257
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,210
or both.

258
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,182
But Claire's
taking it in stride,

259
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,479
and we're in good hands.

260
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,852
Well, it's very frightening. I
can see why you haven't slept.

261
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:52,945
One of us should.

262
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,484
Probably the one
who's calling all the shots.

263
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,791
No, I can hold out
a little while longer.

264
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,796
No, go to the residence. Spend
some time with your wife.

265
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,059
You'll come back
feeling like a new man.

266
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,159
Honestly, it's less
stressful here.

267
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,567
Counseling hasn't helped.
No, it has. Slowly.

268
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,978
You know, I got rid of
Christina when Linda resigned?

269
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,476
I heard.

270
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,575
It's improved things some.

271
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,880

272
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,415
But there's still
work to do.

273
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,415
Makes me tired just
to think about it.

274
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,424
Well, you probably wouldn't
be the first president

275
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,553
to get a little shut-eye
on one of these sofas.

276
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,355
I was joking.
I wasn't.

277
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,164
Do the free world a favor and
get some rest. I'll let you be.

278
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,501
No, stick around.
You should be nearby

279
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,508
if President Qian wants
to get on the phone.

280
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,747

281
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,851
I've always loathed
the necessity of sleep.

282
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,291
Like death, it puts even the most
powerful men on their backs.

283
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,229

284
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,097
 <i>KC Limo and Bus rental.</i>

285
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,567
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

286
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,469
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see.

287
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,803
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't
have one in our records.</i>

288
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,902
My mistake. I must have called the
wrong limo service. Thank you.

289
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,715
<i> Missouri Bus and Limo.</i>

290
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,585
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

291
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,422
You're not Darlene.
No. Darlene is out sick.

292
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,821
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.

293
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,329
<i>How can I help you, Pam?</i>

294
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,127
We've got a flight coming in
from China tomorrow.

295
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,293
We'll need
some transportation.

296
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,600
<i>How many you got coming?</i>

297
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,663
I don't have the manifest
right in front of me.

298
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,765
The usual?
That's right.

299
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,933
<i>So a luxury bus.</i>

300
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,334
How many does that fit?

301
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,608
<i>Fifty-five. Usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.</i>

302
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,843
That's great. Thanks.

303
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,351
 Do you think
it's really her conscience

304
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,081
or because the bill
is controversial?

305
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,117
I don't think she would
have threatened to fight us

306
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,921
if all she wanted to do
was avoid controversy.

307
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,620
I'll talk to her.

308
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,759
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do. So do I.

309
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,631
We need Jackie
more than ever, Francis.

310
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,936
I'm damaged goods with
this whole Adam thing.

311
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,534
No, you're not.
We fought past that

312
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,545
Well, there's plenty of people
who still believe it's true.

313
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,981
We'll get it passed.
I promise.

314
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,786
No, thanks.

315
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,154
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.

316
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,163
We could just
go for a run.

317
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,564
No more runs until the death threats
die down. That's the new rule.

318
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,158
But they let you
go to the office.

319
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,170
Because I was in
a bulletproof car.

320
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,800
Does this mean that
we've officially not quit?

321
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,635
We've never been
quitters, have we?

322
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,984
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry to interrupt.

323
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,715
I was gonna head home, but I'll
stick around if you want me to.

324
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,388
Oh, no. You've been up
long enough. Get some sleep.

325
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,815
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.

326
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,722
Thank you for
looking after me today.

327
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,059
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir. Mrs. Underwood.

328
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,360
He's very dedicated.

329
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,700
He is. It's rare to find
someone like Edward.

330
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,908
What? You never use
his first name.

331
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,577
Oh, did I?

332
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,751
I don't feel right talking about
her like this. It's just...

333
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,694
Technically she's my boss now.
And there's a certain protocol.

334
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,627
 This is coming
directly from Doug,

335
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,291
which means it's coming directly
from the Vice President.

336
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,529

337
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,270
Well, I have seen Mr. Danton
around from time to time.

338
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,275
Do you know what he and the
Congresswoman were discussing?

339
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,643
No. They were
private meetings.

340
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,079
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.

341
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:19,089
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.

342
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,616
Most of the time,
pretty late at night.

343
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,596
 Did the money
originate in China'?

344
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,959
<i>The money came
from tribal revenue,</i>

345
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,591
<i>as our FEC reports
clearly state.</i>

346
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,792
 Let me rephrase.

347
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,667
Did any of that revenue
come from Chinese visitors

348
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,671
who gambled at your casino?

349
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,799
<i>We have visitors
from all over the world.</i>

350
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,846
I'm speaking specifically about a
businessman named Xander Feng.

351
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,442
I have no idea
who that is.

352
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,006
<i>I'm looking
at FAA flight records</i>

353
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,779
<i>that show
a private plane he owns</i>

354
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,343
<i>making numerous trips
to Kansas City,.</i>

355
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,013
<i>And I spoke
with Missouri Bus and Limo,</i>

356
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,683
which has transported Chinese
visitors to your casino.

357
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,351
<i>Miss Syed... </i>
Sayyad.

358
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,521
<i>Miss Sayyad. The only
reason I returned your call</i>

359
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,530
<i>was because you work
for the Telegraph.</i>

360
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,795
<i>And it's not every day that I get a
call from a paper as big as yours.</i>

361
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,831
But I really don't know what
you're trying to get at here,

362
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,134
so if you'll excuse me...
What about Raymond Tusk?

363
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,799
What about him?

364
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,003
Feng has ties to Tusk. Tusk
has ties to the President.

365
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,476
<i>You have ties to Feng.</i>

366
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,142
<i>That looks like foreign money being
used to influence political...</i>

367
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:24,518
What you're insinuating is not
only wrong, it's libelous.

368
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,545
Not if it's true.

369
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,024
I won't bat an eyelash
getting my attorneys involved.

370
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,992
<i>Tusk made the same threat.</i>

371
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,395
<i>If a man worth $40 billion
doesn't intimidate me,</i>

372
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,829
<i>you certainly don't,
Mr. Lan...</i>

373
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,295

374
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,996
Hello?

375
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,635
He hung up.

376
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,175
 <i>I had nothing
to do with it, Raymond.</i>

377
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,803
I can smell the horseshit
through the phone.

378
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,246
<i>You think I'd put myself
at this great a risk?</i>

379
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,510
Desperate men are
capable of anything.

380
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,514
I want it to go away
just like you do.

381
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,183
Then pull her back.

382
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,656
I have no control
over the press, Raymond.

383
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,885
<i>You'll destroy yourself,
Frank. Not me.</i>

384
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,860
Thank you for that
unsolicited advice.

385
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,988
Work with Doyle. Make sure
we have no weak spots.

386
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,859
I'll call him now.
What did Nancy say?

387
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:14,166
Well, it looks like Jackie may
be sleeping with the enemy.

388
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,403
Lanagin is correct in saying
we run the risk of libel.

389
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,943
These links are
supported by fact.

390
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,910
Individually, but you can't
complete the circle.

391
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,447
I'm not saying
the headline should read

392
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,449
"Money Laundering Scheme
Exposed," exclamation point.

393
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,076
Just that we present the landscape
as we currently know it.

394
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,779
We're first and foremost
a financial paper.

395
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,754
Many of our readers
worship Raymond Tusk.

396
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,358
So we just protect him? No.

397
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,792
We don't insinuate connections
we can't back up.

398
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,123
If there's any basis
for litigation,

399
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,856
you can be sure his team
will be aggressive.

400
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,762
Yeah, they've bankrupted
papers before.

401
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,028
 I think you should slow
down and take your time.

402
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,433
When and if you have a story
you can fully...

403
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,766
Mr. Maxfield? Raymond
Tusk is on the line.

404
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,067
Did you put in a call to him?
Yesterday.

405
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,804
He's specifically asking
for you, sir.

406
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,106
We got off the phone with Lanagin
less than 30 minutes ago.

407
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,078
That means that Tusk was the
first call Lanagin made.

408
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,308
Tell him I'll return. Did you
reach out to the While House?

409
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,477
They're not talking to anyone

410
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,986
until after the President does
his press briefing tomorrow.

411
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,956
All right. Walk me through all
of this again, point by point.

412
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,264

413
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,867

414
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,672
Meechum. We can
talk tomorrow, sir.

415
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,941
No. What is it?

416
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,551
I'd like to put
in a request to be

417
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,027
on your wife's detail
full-time.

418
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,030
At least until the death
threats quiet down.

419
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,296
That's very thoughtful.

420
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,302
I'll only do it
if you approve, sir.

421
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,372
Have you spoken to Claire?
When she came home.

422
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,531
She likes the idea. Then
I think we should do it.

423
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,837
I'll let Agent Rockland know.

424
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,736
Sorry
for interrupting you, sir.

425
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,176
You didn't interrupt anything.

426
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,008
Good night, sir.
Good night, Meechum.

427
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,078
<i>What the fifth district</i>

428
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,246
<i>needs is someone
who understands...</i>

429
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,414
 Hey.

430
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,014
Hey.

431
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,224
You will never believe
what just happened.

432
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,386
What?

433
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,194
Meechum came
into the office

434
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:59,259
and found me watching something
other than the news.

435
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,100

436
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,001
Oh, no.

437
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,606
He was very
professional about it.

438
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,771
Were you... No, no, no.
I was just watching.

439
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,278
That's really funny.

440
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,283
What about you?
What are you watching?

441
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,618
The video Connor gave me. It's
our first state senate race.

442
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,122
Oh, I forgot about that.

443
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,454
So did I, until I found it
in the desk this morning.

444
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,926
Let me see.

445
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,258
<i>...been there like I have.</i>

446
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,855
<i>Of course, it doesn't hurt to
have a little Texas in the mix.</i>

447
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,199
My God. Look how young we are.
I know.

448
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,467
<i>Everyone here has been so kind,
so welcoming.</i>

449
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,138
<i> We'll have her rooting
for Clemson before too long,</i>

450
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,541
<i> Now that's where
I have to draw the line.</i>

451
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,743
Do you miss
being with Adam?

452
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,142
Where did that come from?

453
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,489
Miss it? No.

454
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,120
Well, you must.
Sometimes.

455
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,932
He meant a lot to me
for a while.

456
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,265
But that's done now.

457
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,462
What about you?

458
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,464
What about me?

459
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,673
Are you unsatisfied?

460
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,243
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.

461
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,282
We don't have the freedom
we once did.

462
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,354
Maybe it's better this way.

463
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,288
No room for distractions.

464
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,928
I don't mind
the sacrifice.

465
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,363
We chose this instead.

466
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:43,667
 <i>Well, I think
the one thing we can</i>

467
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,435
<i>agree on is the ribs
here are better.</i>

468
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,607
 <i>You see, he's just
trying to get under my skin now.</i>

469
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,442
<i> It's not even debatable.
No offense</i> to...

470
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,944
Oh.

471
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,646
 How's California?

472
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,619
Um...

473
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,286
Exhausting. Twelve
events in two days.

474
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,486
Is this the Golden Gate?

475
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,155
Yes.

476
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,729
I had an etching right there

477
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,803
of the Capitol
before it was finished.

478
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,304
Took 85 years to complete it.

479
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,204
How long did it take
to complete the bridge?

480
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,970
Uh, about four years.

481
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,343
It opened a few months
after FDR's second inaugural.

482
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,740
There was a man
who got things done.

483
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,044
Strong beliefs.
And he stuck to them.

484
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,183
But compromised
when he had to.

485
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,851
I assume you're here
to talk about Claire's bill.

486
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,085
It's not a pet project.

487
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,185
There are three dozen co-sponsors
on either side of the aisle.

488
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,527
It's a serious bill.
I don't disagree.

489
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,589
Except with the language.

490
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,666
I can explain my thinking,

491
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,670
but I doubt I'll convince you any
more than you'll convince me.

492
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,764
Putting aside the military's
honor, chain of command,

493
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,342
all the things
that you hold dear,

494
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,537
let's consider
one simple fact.

495
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,009
You wouldn't have this office
if it weren't for me.

496
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,416
I made very clear that
I wouldn't be a puppet.

497
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,622
I'm not trying
to pull strings.

498
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,216
But you could show
a little gratitude.

499
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,929
If it were anything else,
Mr. Vice President. But not this.

500
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,098
All you're doing is making
the inevitable more difficult.

501
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,563
It's not inevitable. Claire
doesn't have the votes yet.

502
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,532
You really want
to fight us on this?

503
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,598
I don't want to
fight you at all,

504
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,609
which is why I suggested
to Claire that we sit down...

505
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,872
I neither have the time

506
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,142
nor the inclination
to negotiate with you!

507
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,615
Co-sponsor the bill!
Whip the damn votes!

508
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,083
I'm no longer asking!

509
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,716
Then I'm no longer listening.

510
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,293
You don't have just
this office to thank me for.

511
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,558
If you win reelection, you
can thank me for that, too.

512
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,430
Those attack ads didn't just
disappear on their own.

513
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,560
What do you mean?

514
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,495
Why don't you
ask Remy Danton?

515
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,005
And ask him about Raymond Tusk
while you're at it.

516
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,803
That ought to make for some
very interesting pillow talk.

517
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,902

518
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,088
You keep up
the good work, Nancy.

519
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,686
I will, Mr. Vice President.

520
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,857
I miss having you around. But
you're my eyes and ears now.

521
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,025
Otherwise I'd steal you back
in a heartbeat.

522
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,630
Well, thank you, sir. It means
a lotto me that you say that.

523
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,102
Doug.
I'm busy.

524
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,315
The story just broke.

525
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,322
They timed it with the
President's press conference.

526
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,650
Connect me with
the Vice President.

527
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,987
 <i>So the Seventh Fleet is
currently positioned near Guam,</i>

528
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,361
<i>where it will remain</i>

529
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,902
<i>if China removes its ships
from Japan's sovereign waters.</i>

530
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,562
<i>I've been in frequent touch
with Prime Minister Oshiro</i>

531
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,141
<i>and have made personal
overtures to President Qian.</i>

532
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,540
<i>And I remain optimistic</i>

533
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:10,044
<i>that tensions will be quelled
without any further escalations.</i>

534
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,478
<i>So with that,
I'll take some questions.</i>

535
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,038
<i>Mr. President!
Henry, you first.</i>

536
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,482
Can you comment on the Wall Street
Telegraph article, which suggests...

537
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,181
<i>Yeah, I was just notified of that
moments before I joined you.</i>

538
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,053
<i>I haven't had</i> a <i>chance
to read it yet. Yeah, Jane?</i>

539
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,591
<i>Mr. President,
would you walk us through</i>

540
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,558
<i>your history
with Raymond Tusk?</i>

541
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,256
<i>I'm here to answer questions on
Sino-Japanese relations. Mark?</i>

542
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,991
<i>The article mentions
Xander Feng,</i>

543
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,591
a <i>wealthy and influential
Chinese businessman...</i>

544
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,931
<i>Unless this has to do with
the statement I just made”.</i>

545
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,699
<i>It does, Mr. President. Feng has
ties to the standing committee.</i>

546
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,833
<i>And we're currently in a
standoff with the Chinese.</i>

547
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
<i>Economically...
All right,</i>

548
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,999
<i>thank you all very much.</i>

549
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,504
It's not beginning
the story that I fear.

550
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,880
It's not knowing
how it will end.

551
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,543
Everyone is fair game now.

552
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,754
Including me.

553
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,453
<i>This is par for the course</i>

554
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,456
<i>from what we come to expect
from President Walker.</i>

555
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,288
<i>Whenever he's selling
a shiny new car,</i>

556
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,793
<i>he can't say enough about it.</i>

557
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,262
<i>The engine breaks down,
the transmission gives out,</i>

558
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,957
<i>he dodges,
he ignores the warranty.</i>

559
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,761
<i>Well, I'm gonna
tell you something.</i>

560
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,860
<i>Our warranty is the Constitution
of the United States.</i>

561
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,405
<i>And there's no limit on that.</i>

562
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,940
<i>He needs to read
the fine print</i>

563
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,305
<i>and start answering
our questions.</i>

564
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,605
<i>If any of this is true,</i>

565
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,113
<i>we're talking Congress,
the White House, both parties.</i>

566
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,308
<i>Now, I'm saying “if.”</i>

567
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,907
<i>But when it looks
like dirty money</i>

568
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,418
<i>and it smells
like dirty money,</i>

569
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,318
<i>somebody has probably got dirt
under their nails.</i>

570
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,754
<i>There's no real proof
this money laundering even...</i>

571
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,054
<i>But the connections are troubling.
Especially Underwood.</i>

572
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,150
<i>He was the House whip</i>

573
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,092
<i>the entire time the Adohi were
contributing to the Democrats.</i>

574
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,654
<i>And he's working side by side
with the President now.</i>

575
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,563
<i>The President. So this goes all
the way to the White House?</i>

576
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,158
<i>It might.
That's hypothetical.</i>

577
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,635
<i>And by the way, you've cherry-picked
the facts to make your case.</i>

578
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,137
<i>I'm not making a case.</i>

579
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,732
<i>My headline is “PAC Money
Raises Questions." And it has.</i>

580
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,970
<i>I haven't answered
those questions,</i>

581
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,013
<i>but I think the American people
deserve answers, don't you?</i>

582
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,805
You can bet
your bottom dollar

583
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,783
the Attorney General
is going to investigate.

584
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,650
With the firestorm this is
causing in the media...

585
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,743
So what's
our course of action?

586
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,689
As your counsel, I will encourage
you not to speak to the press

587
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,851
until we have
more information.

588
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,121
As your average citizen,

589
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,254
the longer you wait,
the more suspicious it looks.

590
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,492
If there's been any irregularity,
I had nothing to do with it.

591
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,462
Your friendship with Tusk
implies guilt by association.

592
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,300
Are we presuming guilt
before innocence?

593
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,871
I'm a lawyer.
I presume nothing.

594
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,309
But public opinion
doesn't have a law degree.

595
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,968
Give us a few moments.

596
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,041
I have to advise you not to have
any conversation about this matter

597
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,676
without me present.

598
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,049
Your advisement
has been noted.

599
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,688
I'll be right outside.

600
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,385

601
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,962
Is this what you were
keeping from me?

602
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,492
We should follow your
counsel's advice and not.“

603
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,656
Tell me if it's true.
About the money.

604
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,295
With Bill out of the room, we
open ourselves up to all sorts...

605
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,565
Damn it, Frank.

606
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,800
I've been in the dark for too long on this.
That ends now.

607
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,070
I don't know any details.

608
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,481
Feng told me if the bridge
project got approved,

609
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,145
the GOP would
stop getting money.

610
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,314
We approved it. The money stopped.
Jesus Christ.

611
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,324
That connects the White House
directly to the money.

612
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,590
No, sir. You knew nothing.
You still know nothing.

613
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,187
If the DOJ finds any concrete
evidence of foreign money...

614
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,096
Then that's Raymond
Tusk's head, not yours.

615
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,394
You've done nothing wrong.

616
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,436
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.

617
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:24,098
If the DOJ investigates, it
will only prove your innocence.

618
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,074
Nobody walks away from something
like this without bruises.

619
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,672
Well, bruises you can survive.

620
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,271
I just don't know how we can
avoid it at this point.

621
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,579
Unless you want to accelerate
the process and get rid of it.

622
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,450
You could always have the Attorney
General appoint a special prosecutor.

623
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,851
That's a terrible idea.

624
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,346
Maybe so.

625
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,619
And given where we are, Frank,

626
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,523
I'm not inclined
to follow your suggestions.

627
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,029
Well, I wasn't suggesting it
<i>as</i> something you should do.

628
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,189
Just as a possibility.

629
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,028
No, in fact,
I don't think you should.

630
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,898
I think it's better to drag these
things out as long as possible.

631
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,403
Let the public fatigue on it.

632
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,461
And have it hanging over our
heads until the midterms?

633
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,598
It'll lose steam.
What if it doesn't?

634
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,937
I've got the Pentagon
proposing

635
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,874
tactical drone strikes
in the South China Sea.

636
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,879
I can't be dealing with something
like this for months on end.

637
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,441
Maybe you're right, then.

638
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,039
A special prosecutor
is the way to go.

639
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,982
I didn't say that. You did.

640
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,151
No, I just meant in terms
of getting it off your plate.

641
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,449
It wouldn't be on my plate if
you'd kept me better informed.

642
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,151
I have done nothing
but try to insulate you, sir.

643
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,284
Is that what you call the
feeding frenzy I went through?

644
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,893
I make this solemn promise
to you, Mr. President.

645
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,464
I will take the fall if it
comes to that, but it won't.

646
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,305
However you decide
to deal with this,

647
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,465
I think your instincts
are right.

648
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,635
Probably shouldn't involve
a special prosecutor.

649
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,276
Send Bill back in.

650
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,985
You knew about this.

651
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,154
Tusk is a client. Doesn't
mean I know everything he...

652
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,487
Bullshit.

653
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,853
The reason you're a partner
at Glendon Hill

654
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,988
is because you know the things
nobody else does.

655
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,697
What do you want me to say?
Is it true?

656
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,770
We don't talk
about work.

657
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,807
We're not in bed.
We're in my fucking office.

658
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,704
And in here,
you work for Frank.

659
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,300
I work for no one but myself.

660
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,711
Keep telling
yourself that

661
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,940
Unlike you,
I don't peddle my goods

662
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,779
for whoever can pay
the highest retainer.

663
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,313
I'm the bitch
to a lot of top dogs.

664
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,479
I'm fully aware and willing.

665
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,681
But you're worse.

666
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,053
You're Frank's bitch
and refuse to believe it.

667
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,183
That's not true.

668
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,392
Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.

669
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,657
You knew about the money
and you didn't tell me,

670
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,724
even though it's thrown
my seat into contention.

671
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,804
Let's say there was money.
And let's say I did know.

672
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,894
What good would
it have done?

673
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,907
It means you were willing
to watch me lose.

674
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,341
It means I respected the
boundaries that you demanded.

675
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,413
No changes, no special treatment.
This is different.

676
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:45,907
So now we're
making exceptions?

677
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,314
When it's this
important, yes.

678
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,512
You can't have
it both ways.

679
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,854
Were you...

680
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,084
Was I what?

681
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,261
Fucking me
to get info on Frank.

682
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,841
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.

683
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,869
I care about you
more than I should.

684
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,438
But I'm getting tired
of having to say it.

685
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:26,353
He's being moved to a federal
psychiatric facility for assessment,

686
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,382
then a high-security detention center
until the official sentencing.

687
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,223
Well, that's good to hear.

688
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,455
The bad news is
we don't want you

689
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,690
doing any public events
for a while.

690
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,358
My bill is about
to go to the ﬂoor.

691
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,231
I need to have
a public profile.

692
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,292
Your death threats
continue to rise.

693
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,065
We can't take the risk.

694
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,805
Am I even allowed
to leave the house?

695
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,240
Of course.

696
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,306
But we want you to
avoid large crowds.

697
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,313
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.

698
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,245
Is anything wrong?

699
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,117
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood
on our new security protocol.

700
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,549
Can we actually finish this later?
Of course.

701
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,119
How did it go?

702
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,398
He's skeptical.

703
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,725
Should I call Tricia?
No.

704
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,598
Could look like I was trying
to go behind his back.

705
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,831
We'll just have
to wait and see.

706
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,673
I made my case. And hopefully
he'll disagree with it.

707
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,108
This could have been
the wrong move.

708
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,511
Well, don't doubt yourself.

709
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,105
Seth has gotten over 3,000
emails in the last six hours.

710
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,674
The phones
are overloaded.

711
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,650
So you ignore all that.

712
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,948
I can't ignore the
Department of Justice.

713
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,517
What can I do?

714
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,855
Come and visit me
when I'm in prison.

715
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,804
You don't have to
stand by that door.

716
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,811
Take a load off.

717
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,619
Thank you, sir, but I'm
supposed to stay on my feet.

718
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,023
Well, I won't
tell if you won't

719
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:15,492
And if anybody gives you any
trouble about this, or anything,

720
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,728
they can talk to me.

721
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,966
Beautiful night.
Yes, sir.

722
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,469
It's been strange not having you
around these last few days.

723
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,211
You want me to switch back
to your detail?

724
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,841
No, no. I'm glad
you're with Claire.

725
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,249
I just didn't realize

726
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:42,848
how much I got used to your
company until you were gone.

727
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,052
Protecting her is the same
as protecting you in my mind.

728
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,663
Oh, come on.

729
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,681
Why do you do this?

730
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,587
Do what, sir?

731
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,882
I've always been awestruck.

732
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,084
People who are willing to take
a bullet for someone else.

733
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,389
It's how I serve my country.

734
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,226
Well, there's a lot of ways
to serve your country.

735
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,197
And this is my way.

736
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,797
Oh, I haven't finished
with this one yet.

737
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,931
It's not for you.

738
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,978
I can't drink
on duty, ma'am.

739
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,114
It's not for you either.

740
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,576
Well, come on over
and join the party.

741
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,087
Haven't you got sick
of seeing my face yet?

742
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,820
Never, ma'am.

743
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:57,628
To Meechum,
for his loyalty and service.

744
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,599
To Edward.

745
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,573
I'm on my way to my
lawyer's office, Remy.

746
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,073
That's not where I want to be
when I'd usually be in bed.

747
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,078
I can't stop Frank
from leaking things.

748
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:20,585
No, but you can make sure
he suffers more than us.

749
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:25,119
And I say us, Remy, because your
skin is in this game now, too.

750
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,461
<i>Are you</i> going <i>to</i> deny?
<i>Of course I'm gonna deny.</i>

751
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,994
Every step of this was legal.

752
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,466
They can't prove
the links between them.

753
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,131
<i>What about Lanagin?</i>
He'll <i>cooperate.</i>

754
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,998
It's Feng we need
to worry about.

755
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,610
I'll find a way to get
in touch with him.

756
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,976
<i>We do have
one major advantage.</i>

757
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,481
The public can hate me,

758
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,542
but as long as Clayton West
remains profitable,

759
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,551
my stockholders won't care.

760
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,547
Frank doesn't have
the same liberty.

761
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,692
Public opinion
can demolish him.

762
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,318
You need to make sure
that happens.

763
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,790
I could work with
the Republicans on that.

764
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,526
<i>They'll be under
the magnifying glass, tom.</i>

765
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,895
<i>This'll be a witch hunt.</i>

766
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,026
Then I'll make sure that
they pick the right targets.

767
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,739
What you need to do is
go after the leadership.

768
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,069
Make them hurt.

769
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,872
They'll turn on Frank
to save themselves.

770
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,204
<i>Birch. Womack. Sharp.</i>

771
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,712
<i>Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.</i>

772
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,377
Remy?

773
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:30,220
I heard you, yeah.
I got my marching orders.

774
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,817
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>
I'll <i>deliver.</i>

775
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,890
<i>Let's talk in the morning.</i>

776
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,526
The two names
I like the most are

777
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,090
Justin Gaines
and Heather Dunbar.

778
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,601
Gaines has
better credentials.

779
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,102
But he's close
to the administration.

780
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,605
We would've made him a federal judge
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.

781
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,696
That's an
important point.

782
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,902
Dunbar's got grit.
She's more than qualified.

783
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,103
 And there's
no baggage there.

784
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,770
But she's more
unpredictable.

785
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,778
I doubt the Attorney General
would have put her on his list

786
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,905
if he thought
she was a wild card.

787
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,543
Sir, I have to say, I think
this step is premature.

788
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,517
We should hold off and see
what the DOJ does on its own.

789
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,388
I don't want to do it, Bill.
But my fear is this,

790
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,359
if we wait until the water
goes from hot to boiling,

791
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,293
we seem reactionary,
not proactive.

792
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,956
But proactive could
also seem defensive.

793
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,294
Like the suspect
that screams

794
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,959
"I didn't do it"
before anyone asks.

795
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,436
Aside from that, we simply
haven't had time to prepare.

796
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,632
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
No, that defeats the purpose.

797
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,606
Then a few days.
I'd like to go with Dunbar.

798
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,143
Sir...
I've made my decision.

799
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,911
Bill, I'd like you to convey my
wishes to the Attorney General.

800
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,643
Ultimately
the decision is his.

801
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,910
We can't appear
to be pressuring.

802
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,575
Of course not.

803
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,913
Thank you, sir.

804
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,315
The only thing
more satisfying than

805
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,485
convincing someone
to do what I want

806
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,756
is failing to persuade them
on purpose.

807
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,263
It's like a
"do not enter" sign.

808
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,130
It just begs you
to walk through the door.

809
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,596
Doyle's about halfway through
our initial background check.

810
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,638
Every donor,
every political event.

811
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,263
Anything that Dunbar
might be looking into.

812
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,433
Good. Seth?

813
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:55,944
We avoid any official statement.
Follow the President's cue.

814
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,640
In the meantime I'd like to
make some off-the-record calls.

815
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,114
You welcome the investigation,
it's the right step, et cetera.

816
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,412
Give folks
the personal touch.

817
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,851
That's fine, <i>as</i> long <i>as</i>
we don't come off defensive.

818
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,512
I'd like to see a list
of who you'll be calling.

819
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:07,681
Some of this is
gonna be on the fly.

820
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:08,848
It'd be great if I
had a little leeway...

821
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:09,981
Yeah, let Seth
do his thing.

822
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,253
You'll have your hands full
with Doyle.

823
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,454
I'll let you know who I call. All right.
Let's get to work.

824
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,662
Sir?

825
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,800
Yes, what is it?

826
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,634
I understand that
you need to delegate.

827
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,145
But when you contradict me
in front of Seth,

828
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:32,772
it compromises
my authority over him.

829
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,647
You can't micromanage.
We have too much to do.

830
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,379
Seth is still
new to the team.

831
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,011
I need to make sure that
he's doing his job properly.

832
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,351
Well, I think he is.

833
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,626
I am your failsafe, sir.

834
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,790
But I can't be that
if you won't let me.

835
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:56,070
Are you, Doug?
My failsafe?

836
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,133
Do you doubt that?

837
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:01,874
We're flying full throttle
into a hurricane,

838
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,639
and you're talking
office politics

839
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,513
instead of focusing on making
sure we don't get ripped apart.

840
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,844
You're right, sir. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

841
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,060
Is she still there?

842
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,963
Yeah. I told her
I was going for a walk.

843
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,637
Look, Doug, I know you said
you wanted her gone,

844
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,139
but you have to understand
that all I'm asking...

845
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,731
She can stay.

846
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,566
What?

847
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,708
She doesn't have to leave.
She can stay.

848
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,816
I trust you to be smart.

849
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:21,479
Will you read to me?

850
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:25,987
My Bible is inside.

851
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,085
Doesn't have to
be the Bible.

852
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,223
Just pull up something
on your phone.

853
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:35,829
Like what?

854
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,975
<i>Tale of Two Cities.</i>
My mom used to read it to me.

855
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,851
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,

856
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:02,293
"it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,

857
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:08,499
"it was the epoch of belief, it
was the epoch of incredulity,

858
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,301
"it was the season of light,
it was the season of darkness,

859
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,606
"it was the spring of hope,
the winter of despair,

860
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,843
"we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,

861
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,215
"we were all going
direct to heaven,

862
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,218
"we were all going
direct the other way..."

863
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,991

864
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,522
Hello?

865
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,531
Doug, is that you?

866
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:47,332
Hello?

867
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,575
Hello?

868
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,378
<i>Doug...</i>

869
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,319

870
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,187
Yes, Doug. It is you.
