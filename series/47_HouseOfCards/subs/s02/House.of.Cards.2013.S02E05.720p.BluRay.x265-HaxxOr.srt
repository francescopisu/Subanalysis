00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,330

20
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,837
That's all, sir? That's it.
Short and sweet.

21
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,373
Or at least it's short.

22
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,533

23
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,077
In Gaffney, people called it the
War of Northern Aggression.

24
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,549
I personally take no pride
in the Confederacy.

25
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,086
Avoid wars you can't win,

26
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,748
and never raise your flag for
an asinine cause like slavery.

27
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,519
He's on his way.
Fine.

28
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,191
People will move on.

29
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,425
They won't.

30
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,728
The less you say,
the more they'll dig.

31
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,599
Let them.

32
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,105
Willa, could you
give us two seconds?

33
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,970
I'll be right outside.

34
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,816
McGinnis happened
in college.

35
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,116
The abortion happened
five years later.

36
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,951
There aren't any
medical records.

37
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,888
None at all?

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,450
We specifically
made sure.

39
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,995
A nurse? Somebody
in the waiting room?

40
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,588
The doctor was the only one there.
Then where is he now?

41
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,895
It's a long time ago, Connor.
He passed away.

42
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,930
And if I'm not worried,
you shouldn't be.

43
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:58,136
Even still, sexual assault is
part of the conversation now.

44
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,233
Every article and column
mentions you.

45
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,144
If we offer nothing,
we can't shape your image.

46
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,580
I made it very clear
I don't want exposure.

47
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,142
When we have something new
to say, we'll say it.

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,484
Willa, any luck
with the Joint Chiefs?

49
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,491
The Chairman's office
still says he's unavailable.

50
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:20,156
But they did offer to send the
Director of the Joint Staff.

51
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,197
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

52
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,323
Confirm it.

53
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,164
We'll meet in Francis' office at
the West Wing. Anything else?

54
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,499
No. I should get going,
hit the road.

55
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,096
Thank you, Connor.

56
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,005
Get Congresswoman Brooks
on the phone.

57
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,444
And see if the First Lady will
be available this afternoon.

58
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,845
 You want a brief on everyone
on the Chinese side of the Summit?

59
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,682
 No. What Durant's doing
in Washington is just the facade.

60
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,146
This is the real negotiation.

61
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,283
Give me what
you have on Feng.

62
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,788
 Xander Feng. Deep family
connections to the Party.

63
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,387
Grandfather fought
side-by-side with Mao.

64
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,897
Big in the
telecom industry.

65
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,195
Estimated net worth
is over $50 billion.

66
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,325
More than Raymond's.

67
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,696
By a few billion.
But who's counting?

68
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,365
Do they have any other
business partnerships

69
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,137
other than the Rare Earth Refinery?
Not that I could find.

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,513
All right. Get a progress
update from Durant.

71
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,139
Tell her I'll be in touch as
soon as we know what Feng wants.

72
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,881
When a man like Raymond Tusk gets
involved in state diplomacy,

73
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,422
you can be sure he's not
after the Nobel Peace Prize.

74
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,754
He's an opportunist.
But so am I.

75
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,557
Maybe this is my opportunity to
loosen his grip on the President.

76
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,421
Mr. Vice President,

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,828
when are you
returning to Washington?

78
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,924
Mr. Vice
President, are you...

79
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,331
Mr. Vice President,
do you have any idea

80
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,495
how long you'll
be in Spotsylvania?

81
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,061
Any comments on the talks
with the Chinese?

82
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,003
Can we get a comment on
the upcoming summit talks?

83
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,507
Vice President will be
working from his room

84
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,510
for the remainder
of the day. Go away.

85
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,375
Sir, when are you returning
to Washington?

86
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,256
Mr. Feng. It's a pleasure.

87
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,920
Likewise,
Mr. Vice President.

88
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,092
Coffee? Tea?

89
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,066
I've already been offered,
but thank you.

90
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,536
Thank you, Meechum.

91
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,974
Ifs a long flight from Beijing.
You must be exhausted.

92
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,413
I keep Western hours.
My midnight is your midnight.

93
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,452
So, have you had a chance
to look over the proposal?

94
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,542
I have.

95
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,589
Shall we?
Page four.

96
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,459
The refinery.

97
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,222
With Mr. Tusk.

98
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,820
With the highest bidder.

99
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,061
We're prepared to offer
Clayton West a 40-year lease

100
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,168
on the Mei Mei Rare Earth
Elements Refinery.

101
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,399
To which I will
lend my name.

102
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,965
I understand that you and Raymond
are business associates,

103
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,306
but you're gonna have to
open it up to bidding.

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,505
Mr. Tusk will outbid
any competitors.

105
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,072
Well, even so,
for appearances.

106
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,087
Yes. Appearances.
If you must.

107
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,145
So, there are no
issues here, then?

108
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,519
We may proceed.

109
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,987
Page six.

110
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,260
The bridge.

111
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,329
The Committee on
Foreign Investment

112
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,691
will approve a pilot
infrastructure project

113
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,030
to build a bridge over
the Long Island Sound,

114
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,002
from Port Jefferson
to Milford,

115
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,940
in exchange for a 25-year
toll-taking contract.

116
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,443
Before we consider
the bridge,

117
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,706
there's one more item
I'd like to discuss.

118
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,940
"Consider"? I thought the
bridge was definite.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,039
Nothing is definite.

120
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,176
This bridge is
a priority-one item.

121
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,050
It's very important to your President.
I understand.

122
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,852
What would you
like to discuss?

123
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,021
The currency
manipulation suit

124
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,151
which you have
filed against us

125
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,697
in the World Trade
Organization.

126
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:44,235
Which we are prepared to drop if
all other conditions are met.

127
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,463
The point of this meeting
is to allow us to say things

128
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,733
that cannot be said
in formal settings, yes?

129
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes. Of course.

130
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,571
We don't want you
to drop the lawsuit.

131
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,009
Forgive me. I...

132
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,474
I don't understand.

133
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,212
Do not back off
in the WTO.

134
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,720
But you've been fighting us on
currency manipulation for years.

135
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,484
A free-floating currency
is inevitable.

136
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,360
Now I have something
I can work with.

137
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,060
Why the sudden
change of heart?

138
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,154
<i>Not sudden,</i>

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,757
it has taken those of us who
are more forward-thinking

140
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,563
many years to convince
our counterparts.

141
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,830
But China could
just do it.

142
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,102
I mean, you know as well as I,
you don't require a WTO ruling.

143
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,539
Appearances, as you say.

144
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,236
It's important that it looks
like America forced us out,

145
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,006
not that we gave in.

146
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,782
Well, I'll need
a little more time,

147
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,442
so that I can brief
the President.

148
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,254
I'm here for <i>as</i>
long as necessary.

149
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,721
However you would like to
communicate, I leave that to you.

150
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,954
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

151
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,765
In Gaffney, we had our
own brand of diplomacy.

152
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:57,274
Shake with your right hand,
but hold a rock in your left.

153
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,306
Look who got stuck
with the pool.

154
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,746
We volunteered because
we hate ourselves.

155
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,112
Ali's well on
the Southern front?

156
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,208
No news is no news.

157
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,550
Come on. I hear there's
muskets out there.

158
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,248
When you giving us
something real?

159
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,950
We're here in beautiful
Spotsylvania, aren't we?

160
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,584
This is dress-up for
grown men with toy guns.

161
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,493
Sounds like
500 words to me.

162
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,829
 Tell Durant that China
won't discuss the bridge

163
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,731
unless we drop
the WTO suit.

164
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,327
 I thought you said
they want to keep it.

165
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,905
Feng does,
which means Tusk does.

166
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,998
But we don't know
if Beijing does.

167
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,507
You think Feng's lying?

168
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,100
An open currency could
free up interest rates,

169
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,510
reduce inﬂation in China.
They'd both profit.

170
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,082
If they're forcing
Beijing's hand, or we are,

171
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,640
that could throw
the summit into chaos.

172
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,845
Exactly. Look,
Feng may well have support,

173
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,081
but my guess is that the
Standing Committee's divided.

174
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,988
Either way, we'll throw
'em off balance.

175
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,459
Let's leak we're dropping the suit
as soon as Cathy presents it.

176
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,793
Just the lawsuit?
Nothing else in the leak?

177
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,490
A hint of Feng,
but no names.

178
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,964
Let's let this
grow on its own.

179
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,268
 How was that?

180
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,502
GAVIN: Much better.

181
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,509
 I feel good.
What do you think?

182
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,679
I think you're ready.

183
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,839
How long on the code?

184
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,974
Just a couple of
bugs to workout.

185
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,178
I told them tomorrow or Wednesday.
Work's not done.

186
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,216
If I postpone again, don't you
think it'll draw attention?

187
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,653
It'll be done
when it's done.

188
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,521
I'll email you when
the bugs are fixed.

189
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,616
Somewhere public,
a place and time.

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,062

191
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,231
Hey, are you sure
you wanna do this?

192
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,564
I understand the risks.

193
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,898
Well, you think you do.

194
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,870
This isn't the first time
I've been in danger.

195
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,202
Yeah? Paper cuts
at The Herald?

196
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,469
Death threats.

197
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,067
When I exposed
a drug ring in D.C.

198
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,407
You know, I read the articles.
That's small time.

199
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,415
I almost had to go
into protection.

200
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,418
This is the FBI.
It's not a few street cops.

201
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,410
You think you're badass

202
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,390
because you're on some
vigilante anarchy kick?

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,051
At least I have the balls to
put my name on the work I do.

204
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,699
You've never faced 100 years in
prison, you self-righteous prick.

205
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,266
Most of my friends are
locked up and rotting away

206
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,065
'cause they poked the bear
one too many times.

207
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,073
Why? They wanted to expose
government surveillance,

208
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:15,112
the PRISM program, embezzlement,
abuse, fucking torture, lies.

209
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,771
You're a journalist.
Who gives a shit?

210
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,371
We're fucking soldiers.

211
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,885
It's personal for me now.

212
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,418
I don't have a choice,
but you still do.

213
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't have a choice.

214
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,897
Where did
you get this?

215
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,269
You could say a source close
to the Chinese delegation.

216
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,933
Give me a name. All I know is
that it's a Chinese businessman

217
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,602
with ties to the Standing Committee
back-channeling the summit.

218
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,804
In Washington?
I don't know.

219
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,710
With who?
I don't know that either.

220
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,274
If I call the USGR's
office, they'll confirm?

221
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,411
I'm telling you
as much as I know.

222
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,478
Why are you telling
me this at all?

223
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,818
They're going public
with it tomorrow anyway.

224
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,084
You might as well
get the scoop.

225
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,127
Why me, specifically?

226
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,458
You deserve better than a Civil
War reenactment.

227
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,226
Please don't pretend you've
suddenly become Santa Claus.

228
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,559
I give you something now,
maybe you remember.

229
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,899
It's an investment
in the future.

230
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,566
I'm not big on favors.

231
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,071
I said, "Maybe."

232
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,242

233
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,981
Connect me to the USGR's office.
Skip the Press Secretary.

234
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,677
Tell them I want to talk
about the WTO suit.

235
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,143
 Who did
you speak to?

236
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,154
 Connor. He's
talking to Ayla Sayyad.

237
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,918
How much did
you fill him in?

238
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,785
The bare minimum.

239
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,290
 I'd be
a lot more comfortable

240
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,629
if it was you going
directly, as we discussed.

241
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,602
This puts distance on me,
which puts distance on you.

242
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,204
I want you to meet with Feng tonight.
No proxies.

243
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,500
Understood.

244
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,199
Now where are we
with Mr. Goodwin?

245
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,208
Any day now.
Thirty-five to life.

246
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,273
Cyber terrorism.
Penalties are stiff.

247
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,545
This needs to be clean, Doug.
It will be.

248
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,279
One fall of the ax.

249
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,946
Keep me informed.

250
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,114
Yes, sir.

251
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,689
Well, I just think what you
did took so much bravery.

252
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,130
To go on air like that,

253
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,964
in front of the whole country,
and say what you did?

254
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,126
That means a lotto me.

255
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,868
And I admire 
what you both have

256
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,134
been doing to
advocate for the...

257
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,001
Well, for the victims.

258
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,012
Well, women, like you and me.
Not victims.

259
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,378
Men, too.
It's not gender-specific.

260
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,075
Well, yes.

261
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,148
Would you consider
pitching in?

262
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,912
How?

263
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,719
It would send
a strong message

264
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,727
if we had the First Lady
in our corner.

265
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,930
If you think I could help.

266
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,760
If the head of
the Women's Caucus,

267
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,234
both wives from
the White House...

268
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,703
That's a meeting they
couldn't sweep under the rug.

269
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,406
And the fact that the Chairman
sent anyone is promising,

270
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,171
but we need to make sure our
message gets back to him.

271
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,838
I just... I haven't been through
the same sort of experience.

272
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,209
Well, why should
that prevent you?

273
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,674
I don't know if I have a
right to speak about it.

274
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,577
You're the First Lady.

275
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,590
You have the right to speak
about anything you want.

276
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,026
Mr. White?
Mrs. Marbury.

277
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,257
I'm Susan. Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

278
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,424
I know I'm a little
off the beaten path.

279
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,559
Did you have any
trouble finding me?

280
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,797
No. The directions
were great. Easy as pie.

281
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,874
Well, good. Come in.

282
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,941
I have to admit I've been looking
forward to this all day.

283
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,539
I didn't realize you
were announcing so soon.

284
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,777
We've had some great luck
with the endowment.

285
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,550
Well, my husband didn't get much
recognition while he was alive.

286
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,955
I was so thrilled

287
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,960
when Planned Parenthood asked
to name a fund after him.

288
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,621
Well, we're thrilled
that you're open to it.

289
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,497
When you called, you said
you had some questions?

290
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,468
They're delicate. That's
why I wanted to come in person.

291
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,300
Delicate, how?

292
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,101
There are a lot of
people who will protest

293
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,506
this sort of financial
assistance to minors.

294
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,511
And we want to make sure they
have no cause to smear us.

295
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,310
People tried to smear my
husband his entire career.

296
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,909
He never let it affect
the work he was doing.

297
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,080
Did your husband ever perform
any illegal abortions?

298
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,628
I need you to answer me,
Mrs. Marbury.

299
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,857
Did your husband perform
any illegal abortions?

300
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,255
<i>I won't discuss that.</i>

301
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,599
Nothing unreported?

302
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,002
Young man, you're not
old enough to remember.

303
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,131
But there was a time
when everybody...

304
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,540
What about any
prominent figures

305
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,511
who the Anti-Choice
crowd could vilify?

306
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,672
No.

307
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,976
Did Dr. Marbury perform an
abortion for Claire Underwood?

308
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,477
No, he did not.

309
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,153
I know for a fact
that he did.

310
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,888
That is not true.

311
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,356
And I would like you
to leave now.

312
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,855
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury.

313
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,954
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

314
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,230
My name's Seth Grayson. I don't
work for Planned Parenthood.

315
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,396

316
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,981
No. Let him come to me.

317
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,317
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.

318
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,432
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

319
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,365
I'm doing this for your
own good, Mrs. Marbury.

320
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,930
Imagine the media frenzy. Your
husband's legacy, destroyed.

321
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,272
The press hounding you,
day and night.

322
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,710
And Planned
Parenthood Fund, gone.

323
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,874
How do I know
you work for her?

324
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,076
That you're not just some

325
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,243
right-wing fanatic
who wants to destroy...

326
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:59,221
Because I wouldn't have done you
the courtesy of paying a visit.

327
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,222
There would've been
an army of satellite trucks

328
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,386
at your door instead of me.

329
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,794
Well, I won't tell anyone, if
that's what you're worried about.

330
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,795
I believe you.

331
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,935
Did your husband keep records
of any kind of who he assisted?

332
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,938
Anything at all? Notes?
Unofficial records?

333
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,375
He kept a journal.

334
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,041
Do you still have it?

335
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,990
May I?

336
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,994
Go ahead.

337
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,829
Oh.

338
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,671
I need to take
this with me.

339
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,138
Can't you just take out that page?

340
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,678
Someone finds this with pages
missing, that could raise eyebrows.

341
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,805
There's 60 years
of his life in there.

342
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,441
From when we met
until he died.

343
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,986
And do you want
six decades

344
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,921
reduced to one night
in August 25 years ago?

345
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,454
Now just imagine what it
looked like back then.

346
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,019
The edge of the ridge
was a dense thicket,

347
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,154
which allowed
the Northern troops

348
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,166
to come in and form
on the Mule Shoe.

349
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,860
Now, the Southern regiments
were entrenched

350
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,632
in this area at
the apex of the line.

351
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:22,762
As you can see,
the topography

352
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,002
really forced the two sides
down towards each other.

353
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,202
This is the Bloody Angle.

354
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,437
That's right.

355
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,344
I was reading
about it last night.

356
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,643
Close quarters,
hand-to-hand combat.

357
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,016
All told, about 15,000
Union-Confederate soldiers

358
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,610
lost their lives here
at the Bloody Angle,

359
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,452
on a battlefield that's only
about half a mile wide.

360
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,154
Now, Mr. Vice President, we
have a surprise for you today.

361
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,629
I'd like to introduce you to
Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood

362
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,361
of the 12th Regiment
of McGowan Brigade,

363
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,834
your great-great-
great-grandfather.

364
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,166
I died here in this battle.

365
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,396
I think there's
been a mistake.

366
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,135
My grandfather never mentioned
any Underwoods in the war.

367
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,474
We did our research. He
definitely fought and died here.

368
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,535
I was 24.

369
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,174
My son, your
great-great-grandfather

370
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,308
was two years old.
I never met him.

371
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,745
It happened here,
at the Bloody Angle?

372
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,980
At the
edge of those woods.

373
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,551
My skull was bashed
in with a rock.

374
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,884
Leon, thank you.

375
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,392
Now, over here
we've got something

376
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,258
that's very
interesting as well.

377
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,830
Just a moment.

378
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,995
Tell me more.

379
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,898
It was the middle
of the night.

380
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,532
And we were out of musket
balls, just bayonets.

381
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,578
Only half of us
had those.

382
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,546
I had nothing.
Just these hands.

383
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,075
So dark,
couldn't see nothing.

384
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,620
But you could hear 'em,
the Yanks, running toward us.

385
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,921
And then you
could smell 'em.

386
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,184
First Yank that
brushed up against me,

387
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,888
I grab him by the throat,
fall down on the ground.

388
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:55,091
I bit him so hard,
I could taste the bone.

389
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,729
Then he grabs a rock and
brings it down right here.

390
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,271
And that was that.

391
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,637
I was buried in a mass
grave, no headstone.

392
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,233
Could we get a picture
with you and Augustus?

393
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,437
Yes.

394
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,706

395
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,218
Thank you.

396
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,889
He takes it
rather seriously.

397
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,320
Oh, yeah.
They all do.

398
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,126
Now, up ahead,
we have examples

399
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,895
of Confederate ramparts
that we've reconstructed.

400
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,595
And you can see how they cut the
timber and made the trenches.

401
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,607
Now these trenches traded hands many
times over the course of the battle.

402
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,104

403
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,239
You have keys.

404
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,407
We own you.
Yes, we have keys.

405
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,745
I'm gonna put some clothes on.
Forget your clothes.

406
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,818
And I quote, "You sure
you wanna do this?"

407
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,789
And I quote, "I don't have
a choice, but you do."

408
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,915
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

409
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,761
He should know
what he's getting into.

410
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,622

411
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,497
Are those silk pajamas?

412
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,100
Looks even
fancier in person.

413
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,705
Cashew.

414
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,802
No. Don't touch her.

415
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,275
Hey there, little guy.

416
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,376

417
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,985
I've seen you before
on camera, hmm?

418
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,821
Please put her down.

419
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,123

420
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,286

421
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,191
Don't take the chance.

422
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,904
I bought these shoes at J.C.
Penney, $72 with tax.

423
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,702
Rubber soles. You can clean
'em off with a hose.

424
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,367
Please, you're
hurting her.

425
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:51,175
I have a pet, too. His
name is Gavin Orsay. Sit.

426
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,249
I said, "Sit."

427
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,997
Look what a good
boy you are, Gavin.

428
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,428

429
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,438
Is that what you
need me to do?

430
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,671
Quiet. When I say
"Fetch," you fetch.

431
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,215
And now we are going to fetch
Lucas, just like we discussed.

432
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:32,218
If you try to bite my hand,
I will put you to sleep.

433
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,183
Mind if I take a couple?

434
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,807
Doug Stamper, I'm the Vice
President's Chief of Staff.

435
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,248
I know. Sit down.

436
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,113
My grandfather fought
in the Revolution.

437
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,554
China was poor then.

438
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,092
Sugar was hard
to come by.

439
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,256
Now, sugar's
everywhere in China.

440
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,493
Do you like
Old Fashioneds?

441
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,760
No, thanks.

442
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,435
I've seen the news.

443
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,565
Your government was enthusiastic
about us dropping the suit.

444
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,803
They've touted it
as a victory back home.

445
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,312
It is a victory, but not
the victory we wanted.

446
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,177
We're finding that
difficult to believe.

447
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,273
By "we," you mean
the Vice President.

448
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,648
I mean the American
government.

449
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,153
Which he proclaims
to represent.

450
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,655
He does.
And I'm representing him.

451
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,184
Don't inflate your
status, Mr. Stamper.

452
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,296
You're nothing
but an errand boy.

453
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,628
Do you have a message
for the Vice President?

454
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,997
If he represents
the American government,

455
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,092
then why did he fail to
communicate my request?

456
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,367
We question your
legitimacy, Mr. Feng.

457
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,636
Nothing your delegation
has done or said

458
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,006
has in any way
supported your requests.

459
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,007

460
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,274
Mmm.

461
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,441
Smell that.

462
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,783
I use Macallan rare and fine, 1926.
$40,000 a bottle.

463
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,515
You used to be an
alcoholic, correct?

464
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,151
Not "used to be."
Still am. A sober one.

465
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,122
Do you miss it?

466
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,330

467
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,332
$5,000 you just spilled.

468
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,368
I'll send you a check.

469
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,800

470
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,864
I like you, Mr. Stamper, even
if you're just an errand boy.

471
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,135
I'll ask you again.

472
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,536
What is your message
for the Vice President?

473
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,079
There will be no
Port Jefferson Bridge

474
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,807
unless the lawsuit
is reintroduced.

475
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,475
When you do,

476
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,815
there will be those on the
Standing Committee who protest,

477
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,855
but I'll manage them.

478
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,583
The majority want reform.

479
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,818
I'll tell the
Vice President.

480
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,397
Mr. Stamper,
one more message.

481
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,491
Please remind the Vice President
that we are both here

482
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,899
at the behest of our
mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.

483
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,502
If the Vice President fails to
cooperate, I will simply bypass him.

484
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,238

485
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,044
Yes?

486
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,011
It's Doug.
 Fine.

487
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:22,282
Spoke with Feng.
Here's your onion rings.

488
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:28,427
Did you know that General Longstreet
was shot here accidentally,

489
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,591
by his own men
in the dark?

490
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,293
No, I didn't.

491
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,197

492
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,802
All right. Bring me up to date.
Where are we with Feng?

493
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,208
He wants us to
resume the lawsuit.

494
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,247
So, he's sticking
to his guns.

495
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,806
If we don't reintroduce it,
there's no bridge project.

496
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,079
Well, that would greatly
upset the President.

497
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,883
Do you want me to
deliver Feng's message?

498
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,550
Absolutely not.

499
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,559
We want the
President angry.

500
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:01,223
The tricky part is making sure
he doesn't direct it toward me.

501
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,129
So what do you
want me to do?

502
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,133
Get a hold of
Cathy's people.

503
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,761
Do not mention
the lawsuit at all.

504
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,136
Have them bring up
the bridge instead.

505
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,606
Let's see if
Feng is bluffing.

506
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,403
Yes, sir.

507
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,312
We must learn
from Longstreet.

508
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,110
He rode too high
in the saddle.

509
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,312
If a bullet comes my way tomorrow,
it will not be an accident,

510
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,581
and I must be
quick to duck.

511
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,251
Gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

512
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,194
Is the Vice President
attending?

513
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,129
No, he's not.
He's out of town.

514
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,099
I just decided
to use his office

515
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,932
because it's a bit bigger than mine.

516
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,335
Please, sit.

517
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,866
I know this isn't
the first conversation

518
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,638
you've had about
sexual assault.

519
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,304
We've had a very
open dialog

520
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,280
with the Congresswoman
for quite some time.

521
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,146
 Open is
one way to put it.

522
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,652
I think the Joint Chiefs have
tolerated my concerns, but...

523
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,517
 To be fair,
we've been quite responsive.

524
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,645
Over the past
two years alone...

525
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,351
 The Congresswoman has
expressed her frustration to me

526
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,020
that there's still
room for improvement

527
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,493
Mrs. Underwood,
if I may.

528
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,363
Please.

529
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,160
 This is an issue
we've grappled with seriously.

530
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,202
Increased education
and prevention measures,

531
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,567
restructuring
the reporting process,

532
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,038
insulating courts martial
from abuse of power.

533
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,369
 It's still not enough.

534
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,168
 Civilian jurisdiction
is not gonna happen.

535
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,714
We're all aware that's what the
Congresswoman would prefer,

536
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,043
but we won't allow our...

537
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,051
 Am I late?

538
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,019
It's my fault. The
meeting got pushed up.

539
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,715
I meant to e-mail you.
I'm very sorry.

540
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,689
That's fine.
Please, sit.

541
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,824
We didn't know you'd be
attending, Mrs. Walker.

542
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,921
I'm sorry for interrupting.
Continue.

543
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,600
As I was saying,

544
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,068
putting sexual
assault cases

545
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,332
entirely in the hands
of civilian courts

546
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:54,436
fundamentally erodes the military's
ability to self-discipline.

547
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:58,913
What about civilian oversight
instead of civilian courts?

548
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,415
 That's
a slippery slope.

549
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,746
 There were those who said
the same of racial integration.

550
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,720
Integration didn't change the
core operational nature of the...

551
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,690
 But it did prove that the
military could shape its own evolution.

552
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:13,423
Absolutely. But in this case,
civilian oversight is not the answer.

553
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,465
 My husband is a civilian
who oversees the military.

554
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,262
Are you suggesting
that civilians can offer

555
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,565
no guidance
in matters like this?

556
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,870
Forgive me, Mrs. Walker. I didn't
mean to suggest that at all.

557
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,141
Then maybe you
should listen

558
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,268
to the civilian
sitting across from you.

559
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,103
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,784
This is from your own sexual
assault prevention literature.

561
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,085
And in it, it says
in some cases,

562
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,287
it may be advisable
to submit than to resist.

563
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:50,157
I think it's quite clear that
there's still room for improvement.

564
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,973
Did you know about Xander Feng?

565
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,737
 Not until I saw
his name on the wire.

566
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,506
 He's been charged
with corruption twice.

567
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,842
Both times the charges
were dropped.

568
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,677
Do you know what happens in
China if you're convicted?

569
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,842
I'm guessing
it's not good.

570
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:08,974
You die.

571
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,485
There you go.
We're talking about a man

572
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,317
who's only one kangaroo court
away from lethal injection,

573
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,289
who's filthy rich
and clearly corrupt

574
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,985
And this is who
the Chinese send?

575
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,493
You're asking
the wrong guy.

576
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,584
Stop dodging-

577
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,027
I passed a note in class.
That's all.

578
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,458
<i>We placed our
faith in you, Frank.</i>

579
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,799
We still have
the rest of today

580
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,338
and all of tomorrow,
Mr. President.

581
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,430
<i>I need this bridge.</i>

582
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,703
<i>Otherwise, we have to stall
my infrastructure program.</i>

583
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,335
No foreign investment,
no deficit reduction.

584
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,437
<i> And the Chinese know this.
They're using it for leverage.</i>

585
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,538
Yeah, but for what?

586
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,706
<i>Well, that
I'm not sure of.</i>

587
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,683
Then why did we send you
to Spotsylvania, Frank?

588
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,651
<i>You're supposed to have
answers to these questions.</i>

589
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,691
<i>Mr. President, I spoke
to Mr. Feng an hour ago.</i>

590
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,349
What's' he say?
Here comes the bullet.

591
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,359
<i> He claims
that Frank hasn't been</i>

592
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,020
<i>delivering his
messages properly.</i>

593
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,861
I have conveyed his
requests word for word.

594
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,992
 <i>He says you've
been doing the opposite.</i>

595
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,334
Whose responsible for the
back-channeling here, me or Raymond?

596
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,705
You are, Frank. I'm simply here
to facilitate, not negotiate.

597
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,209
 <i>And yet, you continue
to have private conversations</i>

598
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,836
<i>with Beijing's
supposed emissary.</i>

599
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,879
Listen, Frank...

600
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,540
<i>Are you prepared to trust Mr. Penny's
word over mine, Raymond?</i>

601
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,083
No one is doubting
your word, Frank.

602
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,414
<i>Well, if Feng is truly representing
his government's interest,</i>

603
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,417
then why is he telling Raymond one
thing and telling me another?

604
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,549
<i> How do you explain
the bridge falling through?</i>

605
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,389
Well, he personally profits
from a free-floating currency,

606
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,828
just as anyone would
who's in business with him,

607
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,194
such as yourself, Raymond.

608
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:33,066
The refinery and the bridge are
two completely different issues.

609
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,330
Let's keep our focus here.

610
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,566
I want the bridge back on the
table, end of story. Catherine?

611
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,942
 <i>It'll be the first
item I bring up in the morning.</i>

612
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,410
<i> Frank, stay put for now.
But don't contact Feng.</i>

613
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,503
<i>And that goes for
you too, Raymond.</i>

614
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,114
I don't want any more back-channeling
until the bridge is revived.

615
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,910
And, Catherine, you
communicate directly with me.

616
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,885
Yes, sir.
We're done here.

617
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,588
The first drops of
blood have been spilt.

618
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,682
Bullet grazed my cheek,
but I haven't fallen.

619
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,125
Doug, find me a way
to meet Feng.

620
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,528
 We need to discuss something first.
What's wrong?

621
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,399
I just got off the phone with
a guy named Seth Grayson.

622
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,269
I've spoken
with my husband.

623
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,708
GRAYSON: Doug told me.

624
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,972
Thank you for
fitting me in today.

625
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,375
Is that it?

626
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,776
August '86.

627
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,282
And why should
we trust you?

628
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,478
There was evidence that
Connor didn't make disappear.

629
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,285
I could've taken this to Us
Weekly and bought a new house.

630
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,622
Instead,
I brought it to you.

631
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,754
And why didn't you apply when I
was interviewing candidates?

632
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,630
There's no point.
Willa doesn't like me.

633
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,134
I intimidate her.

634
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,171
That journal is my
version of a resume.

635
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,340
Or extortion.

636
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,637
I'm not extorting you,
Mrs. Underwood.

637
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,734
I'm just highlighting
the difference

638
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,146
between a good choice
and the right choice.

639
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,514
And tell me, how would we
handle the repercussions

640
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,646
of firing our comm director three
months after we hire him'?

641
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,087
You don't fire him.

642
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,786
You tell him that you're bringing me
on board to help with the workload.

643
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,160
He stays on with you.
I cover your husband.

644
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,254
Connor will hate
working with me.

645
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,096
I'll arrange a job offer
elsewhere in a few months.

646
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,262
By the time it comes in,
he'll want to move on.

647
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,767
Connor knows.

648
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,536
What's to prevent him
from going public?

649
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,112
I can handle
Connor Ellis.

650
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,181
You just have to take me
on my word on that. I...

651
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,284
Here's what I know.

652
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,790
It is far easier for
you to destroy me

653
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,952
than the other
way around.

654
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,791
I have to speak
to my husband.

655
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,069
Of course.

656
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,971
I didn't make any copies.
You have the only one.

657
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,507

658
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,318

659
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,231
Uh, Johnnie Walker
Black, neat.

660
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,660
Where is it?

661
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,827
It's in my pocket.

662
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,501
Come on.
Something up'?

663
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,911
No. We're good to go.

664
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,344
You seem nervous.

665
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,906
Just because I've been
breaking the law for 20 years

666
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,178
doesn't mean I don't
still get nervous.

667
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,913
Gavin.
Do not say my name.

668
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,217
Look at me.

669
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,630
It's gonna be fine. We practiced.
I'm confident.

670
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,526
This is gonna work.

671
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,976
I got your drink.

672
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,426
 He's more
than qualified.

673
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,799
 <i>What do your
instincts tell you?</i>

674
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,600
That I just don't wanna
end up more exposed.

675
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,107
<i>Well, Grayson
already knows,</i>

676
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,665
<i>and if we don't exhibit
some degree of...</i>

677
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,269
Have Doug look into him. Let's
see if there's some leverage.

678
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,474
<i>Yeah, but we don't know
what he'll find or when,</i>

679
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,777
or what he'll do
in the meantime.

680
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,251
And that puts us into
unchartered territory.

681
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,652
<i>Well, Connor will expose
us too, if we let him go.</i>

682
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,246
Not if it goes smoothly.

683
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,256
<i>If we tum away Grayson now,
we can't predict anything.</i>

684
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,091
<i>And look, he has a lot
less to lose than we do.</i>

685
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,624

686
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,859
Okay. I just...

687
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,936
I don't think we can
trust him, Francis.

688
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,334
<i>We wouldn't be having
this conversation</i>

689
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,666
<i>if Connor had done his job.</i>

690
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,332
<i>I'd rather manage someone I don't
trust than someone who is reckless.</i>

691
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,000
Fine. What's the next step?

692
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,044
<i>I'd like to talk to
Grayson myself first,</i>

693
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:12,206
and then I'll have
Doug talk to Connor.

694
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,941
<i>How are you doing'?</i>

695
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,313
You been following
the news?

696
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,011
<i>Is it bad for us?
Or good?</i>

697
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,815
Could go either way.

698
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,650
<i>Fm here if you need me.</i>

699
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,020
I'm back tomorrow.

700
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,650
<i>I love you.</i>

701
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,818
Love you too.

702
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:30,955
We all set'?

703
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,123
All set, sir.

704
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,635
Let's go.

705
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,805

706
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,814
 Oh, no, no. Turn those off.
Turn those off.

707
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,323
Where is he?

708
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,157
Right this way, sir.

709
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,801
 Did Augustus play?

710
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,068
I like to think I did.

711
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,433
What's your name?

712
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,308
When I'm here,
I'm Augustus Underwood.

713
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,644
What's your real name? Doesn't
this feel real to you?

714
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,316
Will you show me where he died?
The exact spot.

715
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,623
I will, sir.

716
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,766
I'm gonna pay respects
to my ancestor.

717
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,631
I would appreciate
a little privacy.

718
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,063
We'll wait here.

719
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,330
John on the move.

720
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,137
Just beyond those trees.

721
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,076
Thank you.
I'll be good from here.

722
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,124
We're fine.

723
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,665
I hope you haven't
waited long.

724
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,763
It's peaceful here.
I didn't mind.

725
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,468
 Peaceful now.

726
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,307
Fifteen thousand men
died in these woods.

727
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,814
My grandfather's grandfather
died where we're standing.

728
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,851
My grandfather was killed
in the Revolution.

729
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,214
So I've heard.

730
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,182
Do you fear death,
Mr. Vice President?

731
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,556
No more or less
than any man.

732
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,720
It motivates me.

733
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,229
To experience everything,

734
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,163
accomplish all I can
before it all vanishes.

735
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,059
I think you and I are
similar in that regard.

736
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,833
Then why are we working
at cross purposes?

737
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:24,896
Now what you mean is,

738
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,034
"Why am I not submitting
to you and Mr. Tusk?"

739
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,078
You're sabotaging
the negotiations.

740
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,144
And you're using them
for your own personal ends.

741
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,205
Wrong.

742
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,512
It's taken me seven years to
convince the Standing Committee

743
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,144
that this was the right
course of action.

744
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,884
A course of action that will
earn you and Tusk billions.

745
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,017
Why did you want this meeting?
Just to attack me?

746
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,557
To send a message
to Raymond.

747
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,189
The President of the United
States and I are not his puppets.

748
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,835
Now you tell him that. Fine.
The bridge deal is dead.

749
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,665
There will be
no saving it.

750
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,537
Stick a knife through its heart
and put an apple in its mouth.

751
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,939
I won't shed a tear.

752
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,170
Your President will ascribe
the failure to you.

753
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,576
I'll take the risk.

754
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,443
Think strategically,
Mr. Vice President.

755
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,413
You're setting us on
a very dangerous course.

756
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:16,417
Do you know how
Grant defeated Lee?

757
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,892
He had more men.
That's all.

758
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,259
And he was willing
lo let them die.

759
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,266
It was butchery, not
strategy, which won the war.

760
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,394
Mr. Tusk and I have great
resources at our disposal.

761
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,530
Add up all your
billions together,

762
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,804
and you get the GDP
of Slovakia.

763
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,038
I have the federal government of
the United States of America.

764
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,612
Your money doesn't
intimidate me.

765
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,583
The most that you
can buy is influence.

766
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,315
But I wield
constitutional authority.

767
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,221
The strongest army
doesn't always win.

768
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,055
Mao started out with
only a few thousand men.

769
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,559
They took over
half a continent.

770
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,088
Mao is dead.
And so is his China.

771
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,259
But I'm not.

772
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,426
Not yet.

773
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,972
Don't forget. Your ancestor
fought for the losing side.

774
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,941
There is no sacred ground
for the conquered.

775
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,968

776
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,694
We have over
9,000 sewers here,

777
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,527
utilized by several
hundred clients.

778
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,261
Everything from small businesses
to major corporations.

779
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,836
What are some of
the largest clients?

780
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,497
The largest here is AT&T.

781
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,044
Their servers occupy more
than half of the floor space.

782
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,106
And can you show me?
I am.

783
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:47,772
Right this way.

784
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,200
Did you or did you not
meet with Feng last night?

785
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,668
<i>Where is this
coming from, Raymond?</i>

786
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,727
<i>Answer the question, Frank.</i>

787
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,138
I have not contacted him since
you and I spoke, Mr. President.

788
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,699
Just as you
instructed me to do.

789
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,039
<i>
Not according to Feng.</i>

790
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,637
I believe you were also instructed
to avoid him too, Raymond.

791
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,714
 <i>He reached outta me.
I just answered the call.</i>

792
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,807
We had clear,
prearranged terms, Frank.

793
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,319
Months of back-channeling.

794
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,184
 <i>I am on the front
lines, Mr. President.</i>

795
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,882
<i>And I can tell you firsthand</i>

796
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,858
that we are dealing with a regime
that is not being forthright

797
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,055
and will seize upon the
faintest whiff of trepidation.

798
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,861
This is a test to see how far
they can push us before we break.

799
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,401
Do not play their game.
End the talks.

800
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,095
<i> We can't
overreact here.</i>

801
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,503
Well, they walked away
from the Joint Commission.

802
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,734
<i>We can walk away
from the summit,.</i>

803
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,572
The economic fallout would be catastrophic.
The market would...

804
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,078
<i> Or we can just
kowtow and submit to</i>

805
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,204
the new reigning superpower.

806
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,772
<i> Don't be
hyperbolic, Frank.</i>

807
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,351
Well, we are dealing with one
quarter of the world's population.

808
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,852
Mr. President, you would be
making a disastrous mistake.

809
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,752
Where are your
allegiances, Raymond?

810
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,416
With Xander Feng
or to the United...

811
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,016
 <i>Don't you dare
question me about...</i>

812
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,619
All right. Silence.

813
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,091
<i> There were two mistakes.
Both of them mine.</i>

814
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,758
The first was
allowing you, Raymond,

815
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:13,767
to enlist one of your business
partners for these talks.

816
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:14,928
I was simply trying to...

817
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,801
<i> And the second
was enlisting you, Frank.</i>

818
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,771
<i>Instead of clarity,
we got miscommunication.</i>

819
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,934
<i>That's</i> poor diplomacy.
Mr. President, listen...

820
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,909
I've listened to both of you and
all I've heard is accusations.

821
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,916
Now, if neither one of you will
take responsibility, I will.

822
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,384
We're pulling out.

823
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,577
<i>That's not because you
suggested it, Frank.</i>

824
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,783
<i>It's because you've made such
a mess of these negotiations</i>

825
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,225
<i>that I have no other choice
than a show of strength.</i>

826
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,729
You've both disappointed
me greatly.

827
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,461
Mr, President?

828
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,967
<i>The President
has left the call.</i>

829
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,974
<i> Raymond,
are you still there?</i>

830
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:01,607
That's the first time he's ever
hung up on me in 20 years.

831
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,847
I feel for you.

832
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,250
Goodbye, Frank.

833
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,958
And the butchery begins.

834
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:16,431
It's all the way down this row
and the next seven rows over.

835
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,194
Now you wanted to see
inside one, right?

836
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,360
Yeah, that would
be great.

837
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,930
Go ahead.

838
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,342
There's not much
to it, actually.

839
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,810
Just a lot of hard
drives and wires.

840
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,815
So in terms of backup,
if the power goes down,

841
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,178
some natural disaster hits,

842
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,776
like a storm, or an
earthquake, what exactly...

843
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,980
On the ground. Freeze!

844
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,317
No, no, I...  Right now.
On the ground!

845
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,448
On the ground now!

846
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:43,853

847
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,897
Why don't you ride
back to D.C. with me?

848
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,126
We need to discuss something.
What's up?

849
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,563
Talk about it
in the car.

850
00:44:55,459 --> 00:45:00,067
Today, we break earth on the
Overland Campaign Visitors Center.

851
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,367
So that generations to come

852
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,144
will fully absorb the importance
of this hallowed ground,

853
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,880
the wilderness where
the campaign commenced.

854
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,152

855
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,156
Augustus.
Would you clothe honor?

856
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,401
And now, a moment of silence
and prayer for the dead.

857
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,070
Thank you.

858
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,566

859
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,105
And God bless the United
States of America.

860
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,751
I just heard.
We got Lucas Goodwin.
