1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,470
Oh, Congressman Romero,

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,016
I just wanted to see you one last time
before I leave.

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,743
I don't believe
there's anything left to be said.

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,437
No, not between us. Not any longer.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,858
I just wanted to thank you for...
your tenacity.

6
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,197
Whatever you're up to,
you won't get away with it.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
Maybe I already have.

8
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,744
The committee will continue its work.
We'll recommend charges to DOJ.

9
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,331
Rochelle.

10
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,759
Rochelle.

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,929
Such a lovely name.

12
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,809
Tell me how much you don't want that
to end up in the press.

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,521
And then shut this committee down.

14
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,897
No deals.

15
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,114
- Mr. President! Mr. President!

16
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,806
How could you?

17
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,183
- How could you not warn me?
- To protect you.

18
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,853
- I was protecting you.
- You should take your hands off me.

19
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,813
No, look, I understand
if you feel broadsided.

20
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,916
- I don't care about feelings, Francis.
- But listen to me...

21
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,740
- Look, Claire, listen to me.
- You made me look absolutely ridiculous.

22
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,653
- Ill-prepared and ignorant.
- No! Claire.

23
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,155
- We have one rule, Francis. One rule.
- No, not anymore.

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,657
Not anymore. We don't.

25
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,577
I cannot be your ally
if I don't know what you're thinking.

26
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,954
Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.

27
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,540
All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary,

28
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,210
but other committees would have sprung up,
just to keep the charges going.

29
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,797
Oversight, Armed Services,
Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.

30
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,024
It would have gone on and on.

31
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,776
- Years and years of investigation.
- I don't care.

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,261
You should have talked to me,

33
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,721
instead of making
a last-minute decision like this.

34
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,889
I didn't.

35
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:50,230
I created this confusion
in order to take advantage of it.

36
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,527
Everything that has happened...
was planned.

37
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,572
Since when?

38
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,991
Since before Elysian Fields.

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,370
But it was at Elysian Fields
that it hit me.

40
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:11,293
I saw it... almost like a light bulb
going off above my head.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,713
Where does the real power lie?

42
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,133
The power behind the power.

43
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,803
And I understood, Claire,

44
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,433
that we have to think and act differently
than we ever have.

45
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,019
Because it's no longer about
who lives in the White House...

46
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,650
it's about who owns the White House.

47
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,279
This is the presidency.
How much higher can a politician go?

48
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,781
The real power isn't here.

49
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,659
It's beyond here.

50
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,954
It's above it, but still working
in conjunction with it.

51
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,790
Look, Claire,
you and I have always been on the inside.

52
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,501
Trapped. In the bubble.

53
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,588
But going forward...

54
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,301
with my operating on the outside,
in the private sector,

55
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,554
and you working from here...

56
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,934
we can own this house together.

57
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,649
Don't you see? I've designed this.

58
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,403
I wanted you to be the president.

59
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,616
I've made you the president.

60
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,787
Am I supposed to say thank you?

61
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,956
No.

62
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,210
But you will have to pardon me.
Pardon me for all of my crimes.

63
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:38,380
As the president,
you're the only one who can.

64
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,214
Francis, I could be impeached
if I do that.

65
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:44,010
No, no. Look, Davis and Usher,
they're in a position to protect you.

66
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,179
- They want you to succeed.
- We can be sure of nothing, Francis.

67
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,903
Everything going on with Doug,
the leak still in the White House...

68
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,768
No, that was me, too.

69
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,605
- What?
- I'm the leak.

70
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,525
I've been feeding information
to Tom Hammerschmidt

71
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,485
for months with Doug's help.

72
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,864
That doesn't make any sense, Francis.

73
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,575
Claire, when you bring yourself down
before someone else can,

74
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,661
you control the way it happens.

75
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:15,875
This was the only path
to get us to this moment

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,837
where you and I can own it all.

77
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,640
Get rid of the surveillance.

78
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,311
Erase it. Shut everything down.
Anything you and Doug were up to.

79
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,648
All right.
But you have to pardon me first.

80
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:43,152
And, at the right time, Doug.
Or we could both go to prison.

81
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,199
I killed Tom.

82
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,785
I killed Tom Yates. He's dead.

83
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,288
And I had Mark clean it up.

84
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,710
So it will never make its way back to us.

85
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,968
Well, then I guess we both did
what we had to.

86
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,013
- Did you know he was gonna do this?
- No.

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,351
- Because this is bad, Claire.
- This is very... very bad.

88
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,063
My God!

89
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,816
What is it with you two?

90
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,027
- If there's something on your mind, say...
- In my house?

91
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,403
You left him in my house?!

92
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,699
Lower your voice,
or at least change your tone.

93
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,034
Did you take care of it?

94
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,413
Yes, that's what I do.

95
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,290
Then thank you, and well done.

96
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,769
Now let's get back
to what's in front of us.

97
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,712
Does he even want you to be here, Claire?

98
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,339
Mark, please. What I need right now
is your political calculus.

99
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:49,135
He has put you, he has put all of us,
in an impossible position.

100
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,553
You see that?

101
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,266
If you don't handle this correctly,
you do not recover from it.

102
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,310
This is about continuity of government.

103
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,858
Informing NATO, informing world leaders.
We should have had ambassadors on call.

104
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,943
Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the National Security...

105
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,404
Even Nixon did that!

106
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,326
I'm ready to hand it over,

107
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,096
but I want to be assured
that no matter what,

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
Macallan's death is not related to me.

109
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,082
That can be taken care of.

110
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,752
- I want what you have of mine.
- Okay.

111
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,629
That's what you'll get.

112
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,048
And I want to be Chief of Staff.

113
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,511
Well, I don't think that's a problem.

114
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,597
I'm glad you're asking for what you want.

115
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,523
Doug Stamper would do anything
for the president.

116
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,943
He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes,
who the president was involved with.

117
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,320
And he took care of it.

118
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,698
He's threatened my life
on numerous occasions.

119
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,367
- But to go back to my question...
- No, ma'am.

120
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,412
I don't think the president knew
what Doug was up to.

121
00:08:58,495 --> 00:08:59,872
Not at all.

122
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,964
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

123
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,466
I've been meaning to call you.

124
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,179
Sean.

125
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,932
As you can tell, I work here now.

126
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:24,021
I'm shaking your hand right now
because I believe in social graces.

127
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,692
You're lost.

128
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,738
- I don't think so.
- No, you are.

129
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,656
No, not at all.

130
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,199
This is what you wanted?

131
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,537
A job in a corrupt administration?
Presidency in ruin?

132
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,583
I'm in the White House. Not out there,
wondering what it's like in here.

133
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,004
- Not for long.

134
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,716
Once you're in, you're in.
It's the American way.

135
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,594
- Mr. Stamper will see you now.
- Thank you.

136
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,978
Sorry to keep you waiting.

137
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,455
When I asked for this meeting,
I had no idea

138
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,440
the president would be signing
his resignation this evening.

139
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,694
And I, this morning.

140
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,906
- I heard a rumor you might.
- Now it's confirmed.

141
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,282
Mr. Stamper...

142
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,785
Yeah, please. You can call me Doug.

143
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,872
I'd rather not,
for the sake of this interview.

144
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,166
I want you to know
this will not be off the record,

145
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,500
or on background.

146
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,924
I do know Lisa Williams.
I met her a couple years ago.

147
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,928
Okay.

148
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,972
But before we get to anything else...

149
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,228
did President Underwood,
when he was congressman, kill Zoe Barnes?

150
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,817
No.

151
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,693
Mr. Stamper...

152
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,783
did you kill Zoe Barnes?

153
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,077
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

154
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,122
You understand I can use
your refusal in print.

155
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,458
Yes.

156
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,294
Were you on the Cathedral Heights
D.C. Metro platform

157
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,671
the day of Zoe's death?

158
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,632
Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes,
you need to speak with my attorneys.

159
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,015
Did Zoe Barnes make a call
to Francis Underwood

160
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,768
from a burner phone
when he was congressman?

161
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:29,188
- Why would you ask me that?
- Why won't you answer?

162
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,690
I almost always answer
the president's phone.

163
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,400
Calls, texts...

164
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,613
Do you have any knowledge of those texts?

165
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,698
I'm not prepared to comment on that.

166
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,659
Then this conversation is over.

167
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,292
Have a good day.

168
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,298
One last thing.

169
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,301
Did you send me two birthday cards?

170
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,970
No.

171
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,520
SlÃ inte mhath.

172
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,814
That's Scottish Gaelic.
It means "good health."

173
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,649
My father's kind of obsessed.

174
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,486
And he traced our line of Graysons
back to, like, 16th century or something.

175
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,907
Hmm. Well, if we ever needed a drink
in the middle of the day...

176
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,994
It went well with the US attorney.

177
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,247
It's tragic.

178
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,376
Our hearts are just broken
at the thought of what Doug did.

179
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,921
I don't know what happened to him.

180
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,924
I guess somewhere along the line...

181
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,343
When will, uh,
he be announcing his resignation?

182
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,806
- It's happening this afternoon.
- Oh, of course.

183
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,266
And, Seth, you'll need to resign as well.

184
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,730
- Uh... Um, I thought that, uh...
- I know, but think about this.

185
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,568
I need to establish my own team. Publicly.

186
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,864
And there's no avoiding how tied
you and Doug are to Francis at this point.

187
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,285
So, it's really just waiting
for the dust to settle. That's all.

188
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,539
Why does it feel like you're telling me
my career is over, Madam Vice President?

189
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:14,293
No, I'm just saying, you just need
to go away for a little while.

190
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,672
And we'll bring you back into the fold
at a later date, and don't worry.

191
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,633
Look at LeAnn.
She left and now she's back.

192
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
Have we ever had a drink together?

193
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,016
Never.

194
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,828
I wanted to hand this to you
while you were still president.

195
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,340
I accept this with a heavy heart.

196
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,138
I had a strategy session
with the attorneys yesterday.

197
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
I hope they're treating you well.

198
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,021
You know...

199
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,609
Doug, we're not gonna be able
to see each other for some time now.

200
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,536
So why don't you take something?

201
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,247
- No.
- No, no. Go on. Take something.

202
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,292
Anything. Anything you want.
Even if it's small.

203
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,337
Something you can hold in your hand

204
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,217
to remind you of this place...
until you get back.

205
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,179
You go on.

206
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,748
We're a few hours away
from my official resignation...

207
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,336
and you still have not agreed
to pardon me.

208
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,089
And if you don't,

209
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:09,176
I will be forced to renege
on that resignation.

210
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,303
That would be outrageous.

211
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,307
Well, it isn't official until I submit
a signed letter.

212
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,477
And what would that do
to the rest of your presidency?

213
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,021
What would be left of it?

214
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,649
Claire, if you don't do it, you're gonna
risk being married to a felon.

215
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,277
And if I do, where does that leave me?

216
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
Look, is this really the conversation
you want to be having?

217
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,531
You've trapped me, Francis.

218
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,242
No, I do not accept
that I've done something to you.

219
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,288
I have provided you with an opportunity.

220
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,708
Now, you have said before,
that this is your endgame.

221
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,962
And now, your goal is
within spitting distance

222
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:50,051
and all you see is betrayal?
I don't buy it.

223
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,306
Stop talking about what I've done to you.

224
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,311
Admit it.

225
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,105
This is what you want.

226
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
You were willing to kill for it.

227
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,611
So, Claire, come and take it...

228
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,365
before I take it back.

229
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,044
We'll find the most strategic
time and place.

230
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,421
But I will pardon you, Francis.

231
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,784
For the good of the nation,
we need to disband this committee,

232
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,495
and put this behind us.

233
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,498
The president most likely
would not have survived the hearings.

234
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,667
You could argue that he had no choice
but to resign.

235
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,795
But we can't deny that his testimony
struck a chord.

236
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,756
Well, that may be true.

237
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,300
But how is it that you,
Congressman Romero,

238
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,803
his biggest critic,
are supporting him now?

239
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,932
History.

240
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,436
By the end of the day, the country
will have its first woman president.

241
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,774
Look, I've always been a supporter
of the idea of a woman in the Oval Office.

242
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,360
But when all is said and done,

243
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,280
you do realize that Francis Underwood

244
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,283
will still be sleeping
in the White House tonight?

245
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:55,008
Isn't this when you pack everything up?
Or at least take the personal things?

246
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,885
I'm not taking anything.

247
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,140
You can do what you want with it.

248
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,690
- When do you meet with the US attorney?
- Day after tomorrow.

249
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,491
I never thought that Frank Underwood
would not be president.

250
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,827
Not really.

251
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,083
You could just run away.

252
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,127
What does that get me?

253
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,547
You're good at taking care of yourself.

254
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,925
That's funny.

255
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,803
Look, I want you to know
that I care for you,

256
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,764
but I don't know how much I can be there.

257
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,565
I think I'm gonna just sit here
for a while.

258
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,318
Yeah, you should.

259
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,677
Uh, the vice president would like you
to leave the White House

260
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,869
before she's sworn in.

261
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,583
She doesn't think it would be a good idea
for word to get out

262
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
that you were here when it happened.

263
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,615
I do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute

264
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,076
the office of President
of the United States,

265
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,371
and will to the best of my ability

266
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:52,584
preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

267
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,920
- So help me God.
- Here we are again.

268
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,256
You know, if you ignore
all the pomp and circumstance,

269
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,552
the most perverse thing is
I actually believe in the presidency.

270
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,472
Its importance. What it means
around the world, even symbolically.

271
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,477
But I believe in power even more.
For its own sake.

272
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,524
Gore Vidal once wrote
that power is an end to itself,

273
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,403
and the instinctive urge to prevail...

274
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,823
the most important single human trait.

275
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,411
I've always told myself that
everything I did was for her.

276
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,915
But maybe it wasn't.
Maybe I love power more.

277
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,628
For you, and for any dear to you,

278
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,797
I would do anything.

279
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,508
If my career were of that better kind

280
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:46,137
that there was any opportunity
or capacity to sacrifice in it,

281
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:51,142
I would embrace any sacrifice for you
and for those dear to you.

282
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,189
Try to hold me in your mind,
at some quiet times,

283
00:21:56,272 --> 00:22:00,193
as ardent and sincere in this one thing.

284
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,903
The time will come,

285
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:07,075
the time will not be long in coming,
when new ties will be formed about you.

286
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:11,997
The ties that will bind you
yet more tenderly and strongly

287
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,916
to the home you so adorn.

288
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,004
The dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you.

289
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,631
Oh, Miss Manette,

290
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,051
when the little picture of
a happy father's face looks up in yours...

291
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,233
- Good evening.

292
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,613
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Sean Jeffries.

293
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,073
I'm the new deputy director
of communications.

294
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,199
Where's Seth?

295
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,120
Mr. Grayson got called away last minute,
so I'm temporarily filling his shoes.

296
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,289
- Uh, I...

297
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:59,377
I won't be taking any questions. Instead,
I'll be reading from a prepared statement.

298
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,047
A few hours ago,

299
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,967
President Underwood resigned the office
of President of the United States.

300
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,470
And in a private ceremony
attended by staff,

301
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,598
President Claire Underwood was sworn in.

302
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,059
Effective immediately,
she will be assuming the office

303
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,269
of President of the United States.

304
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,190
- Details will be coming shortly...
- You must be so proud of him.

305
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,444
And while President Francis Underwood
couldn't be here today...

306
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,821
Transfer of power happened
three hours ago,

307
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,699
quote, "privately and quietly."

308
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,158
And that's above the fold.

309
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,243
- Anything from DOJ?
- Nothing yet.

310
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,537
No official title to him,

311
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,581
but it's Mark Usher
running the transition.

312
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,751
Okay.
Let's find out who's in and who's out.

313
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,587
The dominoes are falling.

314
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,547
- Now, who's on Romero?
- Here.

315
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,050
- We want the congressman on the record.
- I've got it.

316
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,595
And let's save Macallan for the weekend.

317
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,972
Tom, where are we with Doug Stamper?

318
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,641
There's, uh, something I need to check on.

319
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,269
Slugline, BuzzFeed, half the outlets
in this city are ready to jump on this.

320
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,355
You spoke to him. One on one.

321
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,775
- He didn't actually say he did it.
- He doesn't have to.

322
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,403
Does anyone know what Seth Grayson
said to the US attorney?

323
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,199
Tom?

324
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,455
Two years you've been writing
about this administration.

325
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,083
- This is it.
- I want to follow up, that's all.

326
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,087
I see a beautiful city

327
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,132
and a brilliant people rising
from this abyss.

328
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,719
And in their struggles to be truly free,

329
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,096
in their triumphs and defeats,

330
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,265
through long years to come,

331
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:39,102
I see the evil of this time
and of the previous time

332
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:42,147
of which this is the natural birth,

333
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,110
gradually making expiation for itself
and wearing out.

334
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,989
Surface-to-surface missiles
delivered sarin

335
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,491
at about three o'clock in the morning,
our time.

336
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,703
Moscow has already issued a statement
condemning the rebels

337
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,455
for orchestrating
the attack on themselves.

338
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,625
- And did they?
- Of course not.

339
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,045
Petrov will use this
to justify air strikes.

340
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,256
I'd like to show you an image.

341
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,432
This one is coming out of Reuters.

342
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,394
The feeling is most of the press
will be using it by the a.m.

343
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,191
Experience tells me this will resonate
for about three to five days...

344
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,610
which gives us our window.

345
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,573
- Well, we can ready a statement.
- Troops on the ground is the statement.

346
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,409
No, I don't want to do anything
until we find Ahmadi's location.

347
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:39,037
I'm not sure we should wait on this,
Madam President.

348
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,665
I'd like to remind you
that it was this administration

349
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,458
that introduced the ultimatum.

350
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,628
- You should act on it.
- Yes, but I barely have a team in place.

351
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,589
Well, you can run it
by the former president...

352
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,340
The former president is just that.

353
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,636
- An opportunity has presented itself.
- And I'm trying to take advantage of it.

354
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,514
- Is everyone in the Situation Room?
- As of 20 minutes ago.

355
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:10,526
So, the timing is bad.

356
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,822
If you pardon him now,
you're associated with his crimes.

357
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,782
Republicans will have a field day.

358
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,118
We need some cover.

359
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,828
Well, that would be
Ahmadi's capture.

360
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,081
- The right VP would help all this.
- Have you had any further thoughts?

361
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,584
My short list is the same.
Westervelt, Clark, Klein.

362
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,088
Klein would be the strongest bulwark
against calls for your impeachment.

363
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,091
- Swallowing poison to stay alive.
- Alive is good.

364
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,469
I don't think I can stomach Klein.
He called me a bitch. I prefer Clark.

365
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,975
Tell me. Before you moved the body,
were you able to close his eyes?

366
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,310
Yes.

367
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,192
Look... I know his opinion
means a lot to you.

368
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,695
Francis.

369
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,531
But having him here, in the White House,
even in the East Wing,

370
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,616
while we're trying to figure this out,
it's hard.

371
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,996
At some point, someone is going to imply
that he is still making the decisions.

372
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,623
That wouldn't be good.

373
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,049
- I'll advise her. She'll come around.
- I hope so.

374
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,719
Because if she doesn't act now,
when it comes to Syria,

375
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,055
her presidency could be in danger.

376
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:25,060
- And your future in doubt.
- Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.

377
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,895
I don't threaten.

378
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,564
I just try to remain as clear as possible.

379
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,526
You offered me your services,
and I offered you mine.

380
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:36,738
You know...

381
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,034
I was here before you
and I'll be here after you.

382
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,205
And regardless of that,
let me remind you...

383
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,624
that nothing is more dangerous than me.

384
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:54,923
You need to be practical now.
Davis isn't wrong.

385
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,009
We've been trying to get our hands
on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.

386
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,096
- She hasn't delivered.
- Yes, but this isn't about her.

387
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,682
This is about you and coming out
with a strong message

388
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,185
in your first address to the nation.

389
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,814
This is about setting the course
for your presidency.

390
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,399
Be strong, Claire.

391
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,069
Go to war.

392
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,327
But I need you to leave.

393
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:27,205
Leave the White House.

394
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,752
Yes, I see.

395
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:41,427
For this pardon to succeed, Francis,
we need to appear to be estranged.

396
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,223
I'm just being strategic.

397
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,810
And where do you suggest I go?

398
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,812
I'm not sure.

399
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,108
The Naval Observatory?

400
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,111
Uh, I think the vice president's
residence is still too close.

401
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,654
I'm sorry, I just...

402
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,324
We can't have anyone think
you're still involved in policy.

403
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,911
Look, if you're having second thoughts,
you should tell me now.

404
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,180
- No. I'm in full agreement.
- 'Cause this is no time to hesitate.

405
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,664
I am not hesitating.

406
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,959
I just believe
if we don't play this correctly,

407
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,502
as far as the public,

408
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:18,464
my term will be nothing
but survival for both of us.

409
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,176
All right.

410
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,638
I want you to know I'm here if you need...

411
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:31,978
any advice on policy or...
anything else you might need.

412
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,983
Thank you. I'm going to bed.

413
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,243
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

414
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,121
I hope you know that.

415
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:56,711
Just as I know that no one
will ever love me... like you.

416
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,041
"Under the porcelain frog."

417
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,671
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.
You won't get a second chance.

418
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,801
- And the middle one?
- My favorite baseball player?

419
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,637
"Wade Boggs." Two G's.

420
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,686
And the last? "What did you leave
in that hotel room in Austin?"

421
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,732
Where is my gun?

422
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,781
Here you go.

423
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,417
What guarantees do I have?

424
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,005
I gave you your gun back.

425
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,387
But what made you give it to him?
I'm curious.

426
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,265
I thought he was in danger.

427
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,602
And now you think what?

428
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,566
That is what I'm asking.

429
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,990
As long as I'm around,
you'll be a part of this administration.

430
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,909
We both know too much about Aidan.

431
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,704
And Claire knows how loyal you are.
I'm sure of it.

432
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,586
So, what did you leave
in that hotel room in Austin?

433
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,592
A bracelet.

434
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:34,179
Oh, that's too bad.

435
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,396
You know, I finally got a look at what
Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.

436
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,565
I was shocked to realize the degree

437
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,733
to which you and your husband
stole this election.

438
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,740
I need to be honest with you.
I've been in talks with him about

439
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,285
helping him start a foundation
of some kind.

440
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,787
In exchange for influence over you.

441
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,667
Interesting.

442
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,799
I'm trying to help you
navigate this transition.

443
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,600
Who are you to me?

444
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,271
- Who do you want me to be?

445
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,939
That's not a good answer.

446
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,905
You're the first woman President
of the United States.

447
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,202
All you've had to swallow,
the sacrifices, the compromises.

448
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,287
You're gonna want to isolate yourself.

449
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,414
Not trust anyone.

450
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:48,211
But that's exactly what you're gonna need.
Someone to tell you what's what.

451
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,464
And is that person you?

452
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,011
Is it?

453
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,306
I don't think there's anything
I could say that would convince you

454
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,682
if you don't already feel it.

455
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,937
Ms. Davis,
you are asking me to start a war.

456
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,984
And you seem to deliver on promises
when it suits you.

457
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,737
So forgive me
if I question your intentions.

458
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,783
I like you.

459
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,993
I like being around you.

460
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,375
And sometimes that makes me
less effective than I should be.

461
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:37,092
Pardoning or not pardoning your husband,
in either case, he's a liability.

462
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:41,222
If it's not treated properly...

463
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:46,311
your husband's liver could fail him
at any time.

464
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,980
It's not the kind of thing I could do.

465
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,527
But I could find someone, or...

466
00:35:55,403 --> 00:36:00,491
I... I don't know if you realize, but...
even something like gelsemium

467
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,078
can be lethal in higher doses.

468
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,751
My husband's health is just fine.

469
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,383
I'll continue to work with him.
Follow your lead.

470
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,014
Here's my client's passport.

471
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,142
- There's a few things we want to go over.
- That we haven't already?

472
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,813
No cuffs, when you walk him out of here.
I need to be sure.

473
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,733
Oh, come on, James,
we aren't gonna play that on this.

474
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,195
You have some very good friends,
Mr. Stamper,

475
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,071
to keep the press out of this.

476
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,866
You will walk out of here
like a gentleman.

477
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,910
We want him in front of the judge
within 12 hours.

478
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,455
We don't even know
if we're gonna charge him yet.

479
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,706
I did it.

480
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,292
Let's get going.

481
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,257
Who do you have on her cabinet?

482
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:00,218
Right now, they're just suggestions.

483
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,596
Oh, come on. We both know how this works.
You've already made your choices.

484
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,479
You wouldn't be worth your salt
if you hadn't.

485
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:08,226
I just want you to run them by me first.

486
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:12,146
Look, I can make this transition
easy for you or not.

487
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,066
And a word of advice.

488
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,529
She's gonna need some friendly faces
looking at her across that table.

489
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,613
There'll be a few...

490
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,283
who will smile as required.

491
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,827
Would you look at this?

492
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,876
Both Special Forces. Former.

493
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,255
They know how to forget,
so you don't have to worry about them.

494
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,966
And the body?

495
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,637
It's on ice.

496
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,269
I just made contact with Nasser.

497
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,104
We have secured the location of Ahmadi.

498
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,275
- I'll assemble the team.
- I called Admiral Dale already.

499
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,859
So we have some decisions to make.

500
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,071
Once we have troops on the ground,
we'll need to take a close look

501
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,198
at who we're considering for your cabinet.

502
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,134
You'll need a team around you
with wartime experience.

503
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,536
I have some suggestions
I've passed on to Mark.

504
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,997
I think Deputy Director of the CIA,
Marcy Siegerson,

505
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:16,377
would make a terrific Secretary of State.
Someone I could easily liaison with.

506
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,506
Well, I was hoping that you would be
on my cabinet, in some capacity.

507
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,051
I'll be operating out of the region.
It's where my strength lies.

508
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,220
There are better people
who can take it from here,

509
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,930
advise you on the home front.

510
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:31,892
And Ms. Harvey, LeAnn,
we need to move you.

511
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,978
Uh, just for now, of course.

512
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,189
- It was my understanding that...
- Right now a more seasoned Chief of Staff

513
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:40,443
would send a strong message to
the Congress and to the nation. For now.

514
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:03,257
She'll do it. She'll send in the troops.

515
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,343
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.

516
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,970
And our deal stays in place.

517
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,972
- Yeah, hold on a second.

518
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,265
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

519
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,107
Yes. Ms. Harvey has her gun back.

520
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,193
Macallan's files are with the president.

521
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,822
Any hard evidence connecting you
to the election...

522
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,491
is in her hands.

523
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,411
Then LeAnn's job is done.

524
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,877
If you have anything to say,
now is the time.

525
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,633
What do you think happened?

526
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,386
I'd prefer you tell me that.

527
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,474
Humor me. You asked for this meeting.

528
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,267
What do you think happened?

529
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,983
I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating

530
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,401
a relationship you were having
with Rachel Posner.

531
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,030
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger

532
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,535
Francis Underwood,
who you would do anything for.

533
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,123
But did anyone think
about the life of Zoe Barnes?

534
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,962
You know,
you think you can erase something.

535
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,799
Then you find out that's not possible.

536
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,221
Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me
to speak with you.

537
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,683
I'm sorry,
there's just nothing more to say here.

538
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,060
I don't know what happened
to Rachel Posner.

539
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,523
But I don't believe you killed Zoe Barnes.

540
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,109
Is this you in this video?

541
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,324
Looks like me.

542
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,675
I've thought long and hard, Francis.

543
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,093
Barely slept.

544
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,470
That's the job.

545
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,475
I'm going to send in troops.
I'll be announcing it tomorrow night.

546
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,063
I think you're doing the right thing.

547
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,317
Do you hate it here?

548
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,111
Oh, you know I don't like hotels.

549
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:15,825
An approximation of home
just to remind you you're not there.

550
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,705
Well, we don't live in a home.

551
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,792
We live in a house,
borrowed and temporary.

552
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,591
Something in your eye. A look.

553
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,801
It's changed.

554
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,056
We're the same now, you and I.

555
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,017
- How so?
- You know how.

556
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:45,771
It's been a long time
since I surprised myself.

557
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,025
You'll recover.

558
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,321
You're the most powerful woman
in the world, Claire.

559
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,866
Comfort pales by comparison.

560
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,789
I'll announce it during the speech,
after the troops.

561
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,166
A full and unconditional pardon...

562
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:10,170
for Francis Underwood and any crimes
he might have committed

563
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,757
against the United States while president.

564
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,926
I'm glad to hear that.

565
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,806
It was never in doubt.
I just needed to think about how.

566
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,646
So how long does this arrangement last?

567
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
For the time being.

568
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,485
How did we get here, Francis?

569
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,863
Oh, let it go. It's done.

570
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,992
Oh, and one word of advice.

571
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,120
Whomever Usher offers up to you
as vice president,

572
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,123
that's the person
that you're really gonna have to watch.

573
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,502
I won't choose anyone I can't manage.

574
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,424
Southwest corner
of the building. Maintain visual.

575
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,550
Copy that.

576
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,345
- Frag out!

577
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,224
There's Ahmadi.
I have visual on Ahmadi.

578
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,392
- I see him.
- Go, go! Fire!

579
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,776
I made a terrible mistake.

580
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,823
What did you do?

581
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,534
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
I, uh...

582
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,580
This morning I started driving.
I... I got scared.

583
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,543
Anyway, I'm on my way back.
Can I come see you?

584
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,920
Yes, please.

585
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,296
Sometimes you don't have to watch
the whole movie to know how it ends.

586
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,594
The speech is gonna play well
with both parties.

587
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,597
Where are we with the Republicans?

588
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,641
Trading names
when it comes to your cabinet.

589
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,352
We have our generals, which is good.

590
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,398
Some corporate types, outsiders.
Make you seem like a renegade.

591
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:17,942
Corporate, from where?

592
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,987
Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.

593
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,824
Occasional D.C. lifer sprinkled
into the mix

594
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,700
to make sure the trains run on time.

595
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,785
I was going over our list
for vice president.

596
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,162
Yeah. Hold on.

597
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,833
Uh, this will seem unexpected,

598
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,711
but a lot of the people
I spoke to suggested me.

599
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,676
You're not a politician.

600
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,304
Exactly.

601
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,389
But I could be by your side.

602
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,935
Most of the Hill and the Senate
would not come near us.

603
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,607
- I'll take it into consideration.
- It's beyond that. You'll need me.

604
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,026
Excuse me?

605
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,653
I can help. Look...

606
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:07,741
It is the way
to keep you in power.

607
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,161
And keep your secrets.

608
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,548
Good evening.

609
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:28,053
I'm here to report to the American people
and the world

610
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:33,850
that early this morning, Special Forces
killed the ICO terrorist Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

611
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,810
We got him.

612
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,188
We got him.

613
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,942
Now, there comes a time
in every president's tenure

614
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:46,071
when he or she must face the question
of whether or not

615
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,449
to send young American soldiers
into harm's way.

616
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,618
In my case...

617
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:56,623
that time has fallen within
the very first days of my presidency.

618
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:01,628
Russian President Viktor Petrov
collaborated with the Chinese

619
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:04,924
on illegal oil exploration in Antarctica.

620
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,177
Recently, we have learned
that he has sent troops

621
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,429
to fight alongside the Syrian regime,

622
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,723
assisting them in the destruction
of the Syrian nation.

623
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,769
These forces are using chemical weapons
on their own people,

624
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:22,441
torturing the opposition, and starving
huge segments of the population.

625
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,734
The Syrians are a people besieged.

626
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,405
Let them not also be forgotten.

627
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:32,867
The time has come for our outrage
to be turned into action.

628
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,331
Five months ago, my husband addressed
the House of Representatives

629
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,709
and asked them to declare war on ICO.

630
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,544
Congress failed him.

631
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:45,505
Congress failed you.

632
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:52,596
ICO extremists want democracy
and America itself to die a fiery death.

633
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,100
We cannot allow that to happen.

634
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:00,729
We can't wait for Congress any longer.
We gave Congress every chance.

635
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,023
She isn't going to say it.

636
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,569
Now, history judges every leader,
every president,

637
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:10,864
by how he or she treats
his or her own people.

638
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:15,910
A regime that would target hospitals,
refugee camps,

639
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:21,416
schools or bread lines in order
to retain power must be confronted.

640
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,963
A leader that would sacrifice the physical
and emotional well-being of his citizens,

641
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,175
that would treat his people as pawns,

642
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,553
just to stay in power? Well...

643
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,723
that leader needs to be stopped.

644
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,811
If she doesn't pardon me...

645
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,523
I'll kill her.

646
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,694
Thank you
and God bless this great country.

647
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,496
Well, the calls are coming in already.

648
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,581
Well done.
This'll be a good night for you.

649
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,707
Nothing from Moscow yet.

650
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,876
Right now I just need some time to myself.

651
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,426
- Do you know Tom Yates?

652
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,344
Uh, not personally. Why?

653
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,305
He hasn't been around in a while.

654
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,765
I don't know, forget it.

655
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,684
What?

656
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:24,354
I've been calling him.
And he usually answers.

657
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,317
We demand justice,
we demand peace!

658
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,652
No more war in the Middle East!

659
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:33,280
We demand justice, we demand peace!

660
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,699
No more war in the Middle East!

661
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,327
We demand justice, we demand peace!

662
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,745
No more war in the Middle East!

663
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,040
- We demand justice, we demand peace...

664
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,418
The anti-war demonstrations
outside the White House

665
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,586
finally got out of hand.

666
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,380
You've reached
LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.

667
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,799
One of the protesters
made his way over the gates.

668
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:54,843
As he was running across
the White House lawn,

669
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:59,013
Secret Service agents moved in,
tragically shooting and killing the man.

670
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,816
You've reached
LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.

671
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:11,693
Hey, where are you?

672
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,480
I'm sorry, ma'am,
it's just not possible tonight.

673
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,773
We can't secure the run.

674
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,276
The level of threat at this point
is just too high.

675
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,487
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

676
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,030
My turn.
