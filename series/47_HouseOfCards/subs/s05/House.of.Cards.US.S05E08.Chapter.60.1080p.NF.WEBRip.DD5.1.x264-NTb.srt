1
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,714
Crow of Elysium, we honor thee!

2
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:52,344
We honor thee!
We honor thee! We honor thee!

3
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,181
No mortal flame can
destroy common woe.

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,766
Just one fire can conquer.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,604
Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,023
Hail, brothers!
Many brothers!

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,112
Brothers many, make brothers one.

8
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,741
Hail, fellowship!
Hail Crow in his verdant kingdom.

9
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,410
Common woe, be done!

10
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,539
Hail, brothers!
Common woe, be done!

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,917
Set us free! Set us free!

12
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,338
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!

13
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,146
Yeah... look around.

14
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,233
Some of the most powerful men in the world
are gathered in this clearing.

15
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,237
Members of one of our country's
most exclusive clubs.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,698
Invitation only, unless, of course,
you invite yourself.

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,912
They gather here to seek God between
the branches of these magnificent trees.

18
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,873
They eat together,
they piss next to each other,

19
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:06,668
and they carve up the world
like a Sunday roast.

20
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,129
This is where the real power is.

21
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,839
No women or presidents allowed.

22
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,177
The former, I am not.
The latter, I will be again,

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,015
because I have managed to reduce
a national election down to one state.

24
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:26,020
And while these men here can't swing
the votes of an entire nation...

25
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,980
one measly state?

26
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,320
Well, that they can do.
And that's why I'm here.

27
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,579
So welcome to Elysian Fields.

28
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,614
It's strange for you, isn't it?
Without him here.

29
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,158
It's not strange, ma'am.

30
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,372
LeAnn's in Cincinnati,
trying to close the deal for the debate.

31
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,767
The president will make
a series of appearances across the state

32
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,250
as soon as he gets back.

33
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,463
If he survives the weekend. Anything?

34
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,672
No phones allowed.

35
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,508
Well, we're dividing and conquering.

36
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,679
This Chinese trade agreement is going
to make Ohio voters very happy.

37
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,888
It could help us win.

38
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,993
- I didn't know the deal had closed.
- Well, we're on the verge.

39
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,330
The president can make the announcement
in Canton when he appears.

40
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,230
Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself...

41
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,898
since I did the deal.

42
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,277
Doug, you are very sincere...

43
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,698
and very loyal to Francis.
- And loyal to you, ma'am.

44
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,157
I hope you know that.

45
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,953
I don't mind it
if you call me Claire, you know.

46
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,789
I'll show Ms. Davis in.

47
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,839
Hi, Jane.

48
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,175
Would you mind going over these numbers
with me before we meet with the minister?

49
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,430
I have what China says they'll settle for,
and what I know they'll settle for.

50
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,182
And listen, I want to thank you so much
for helping us with this.

51
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,310
I'd like to see
an Underwood administration.

52
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,896
Doug, that's all for now.

53
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,149
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,595
- You can show me.
- I don't want to.

55
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,431
You don't have to protect me.

56
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,185
Each of them has a story.

57
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,480
Even if they got lost somewhere.

58
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,152
It's harder to disappear
than you would think.

59
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,531
But Rachel...

60
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,783
is nowhere.

61
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,295
I recognize that neck.

62
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,925
Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.

63
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, I owe you this.

64
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,764
Oh.

65
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,519
- He didn't expect you to show up.
- I'm always happy to see old friends.

66
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,688
And make new ones. Frank Underwood.

67
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,024
- Benjamin Grant.
- Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.

68
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,193
You're a big supporter of my opponent.

69
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,947
He's a forward-thinking guy and a friend,
who should be president right now.

70
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,676
There's no talking politics or business
while we're here, gentlemen.

71
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,285
Yes, we don't want to poison
all this nature with words.

72
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
You know the motto.

73
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes, "Buzzing bees, sting not here."
It's hard to miss.

74
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,542
Ted, I think you know everybody.

75
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,004
Common woe never stood a chance.
Mr. President.

76
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,556
First time you've been invited,
I understand.

77
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm almost sure there's an insult
in there somewhere, General.

78
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,847
You know, Ted and I just had
the most remarkable piece of red meat

79
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,974
at a steak house out in Canton.

80
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,727
I can't remember, do you like prime rib?

81
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,522
- In the right company.
- Uh-huh.

82
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,649
If you'll excuse us,

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,778
Ted and I promised young Benjamin here
we'd find him an adult beverage.

84
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,363
- Drink?
- I'd rather not.

85
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,579
You know, everybody was looking forward
to spending some time with the general.

86
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,247
And now you're here as well.

87
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,042
After this weekend, who knows?

88
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,629
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election
will get itself resolved.

89
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,049
Oh, one little piece of advice

90
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,217
that I could give you
as long as you're out here.

91
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,764
If you don't bother the yellow jackets,
they won't bother you.

92
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,690
So why didn't you invite Conway?

93
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,193
Brockhart was invited instead.

94
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,821
So there's not going to be
a debate next week, is there?

95
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,531
Not a presidential one, no.

96
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,451
I should really be in Ohio, shaking hands.

97
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,369
Yeah, you bargained
to get in here, Francis,

98
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,056
and now you're here.
So let me suggest something.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
Fuck Ohio.

100
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,042
This is the campaign.

101
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,672
The general is a traitor, you know that.

102
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,841
The general is trying to be a politician.

103
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,761
You would have done the same.

104
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,514
Yeah, but better.

105
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,144
...President Underwood?

106
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,024
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am,
but you're needed in the Situation Room.

107
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,702
Cathy.

108
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,080
I wanted a moment with you
before we join the rest of the team.

109
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,708
- Oh, I was briefed on the way over.
- Not fully.

110
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,127
A Russian research vessel
is stuck and sinking...

111
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,088
Yes, they claim they were
taking core samples,

112
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,923
some global warming nonsense.

113
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,925
But they were looking for oil.

114
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,220
There was a distress signal
and then all communication just shut down.

115
00:09:56,303 --> 00:10:00,767
We're the only country in position
to rescue. So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.

116
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,560
- They declined?
- And denied.

117
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,397
Petrov does not want us
to see what's on board.

118
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,319
I understand this is a difficult decision,
but there are human lives at stake,

119
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,905
and if help arrives,

120
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,658
- Petrov will be forced to take it.
- Okay.

121
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,827
Well, thank you. I need to speak
with President Petrov directly.

122
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:25,708
A rescue at sea
and a chance to embarrass us?

123
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,380
Just before your second Election Day?

124
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,846
Sounds like I would be helping you, hmm?

125
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,766
The boat sinks, your crew dies.

126
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,600
How is that going to look at home?

127
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,229
I tell my people how things look,
and that's how they look.

128
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,982
I want to show you something.

129
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,111
Wait a minute. Hmm.

130
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,657
- There. Do you like my face?
- A beard doesn't suit you.

131
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,663
I wonder how your citizens would feel
about what you've done.

132
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,540
I could return your crew
to Russia, Viktor.

133
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,710
You could return Aidan Macallan.

134
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,213
Ah, I don't like to quantify
human worth...

135
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,050
but Macallan's is higher.

136
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,096
Social media is a powerful tool.

137
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,890
If there is any rescue attempt
by the United States,

138
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,393
I will tell the people of Ohio
exactly how you look to them.

139
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,646
Exactly how you disrupted
their state's vote.

140
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,485
And they will believe me.

141
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,447
- Oppenheimer was a member.

142
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,610
That tree right over there,

143
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,827
right under that tree,
Manhattan Project was born.

144
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,080
And right under this one,
I'm relieving myself.

145
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,835
I hope you're not equating me
to the atom bomb.

146
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,923
What do you want? Cabinet position?

147
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,767
- Frank Underwood...
- Judicial appointments?

148
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,302
- Legislative support?
- Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.

149
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,430
Oh, right. Because the Manhattan Project
had absolutely nothing to do

150
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,142
with business or politics.
- I want you to breathe.

151
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:11,188
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts
through the trees.

152
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,693
Take this time, Francis,
to know your other attendees.

153
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,613
Think about what kind of president
you really want to be.

154
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,908
What am I supposed to do with that?

155
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,701
Just...

156
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
Oh, is that what you told the general?

157
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,249
Insubordination.

158
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,251
Clandestine coup.

159
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,837
Oh, yes, that's the stuff
of real leadership.

160
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,966
- People with money like uniforms.
- Mark, just tell me what they want.

161
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,931
They're waiting for you.

162
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,955
You're up early, Mr. President.

163
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,748
Always.

164
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:17,588
Are you hungry? I have, uh, eggs,
and orange juice, mountain oysters.

165
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,009
You mean bull's testicles, don't you?

166
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,720
I prefer to call things what they are.

167
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,933
Ah.
This is unexpected.

168
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,938
I thought you'd stay out there campaigning
till your dying breath.

169
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,523
What, and leave you out here all alone
in the wilderness

170
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,775
to make all these important decisions?

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,115
You've done well by me, Raymond.
I'd like your support.

172
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,657
I've done well by your wife.

173
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,121
Who happens, at this moment,
to rule the White House.

174
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,083
Tell me you're not peddling influence
with your wife?

175
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,295
Who, you mean the current
acting President of the United States?

176
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,131
For the next two weeks.

177
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,635
A little restraint?
Now, that... that would be unexpected.

178
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,013
...How do you like your eggs?

179
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,265
- In the afternoon.

180
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
Good morning, Mr. President.

181
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,394
Oh, no presidents here at Elysian Fields,
isn't that right?

182
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,274
Only former ones...
or future.

183
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:24,488
Well, I won't call this politics, then.
Just current affairs.

184
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,866
We had a real chance to get Ahmadi.

185
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,700
Our campaign was briefed.

186
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,745
I think a little more than just briefed.

187
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,041
Do you have
an extra pair of socks, Raymond?

188
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,708
After 30 years of military service,

189
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,794
- you'd think I'd arrive prepared.

190
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,923
Oh, I'm sure someone around here
could find you a pair.

191
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,467
- Under my bunk.
- Thank you.

192
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,308
He's a good man.

193
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,522
Hard to find anybody
who distrusts or dislikes him.

194
00:14:58,605 --> 00:14:59,690
Hmm.

195
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,361
So do you want eggs or not?

196
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,543
With this rate of tariff, I'm confident
it'll have a mitigating effect

197
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,212
on the anti-dumping cases.

198
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,880
I think this is going to work.

199
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll need to run this by
my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.

200
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,553
I think this is a very good day
for both of our countries.

201
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:30,804
Yes, it is.

202
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,390
There's an American on the boat.

203
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,186
The Russian research vessel.

204
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,356
- And how do you know that?
- Mr. Xu told me before you came in.

205
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,236
I will need proof of that fact.

206
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,991
Of course, but we are only telling you
because we know you'll want to rescue him.

207
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,452
And China is willing to help
in any way we can.

208
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm just curious, Mr. Xu,
why are you so focused on this situation?

209
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,629
For humanitarian reasons.

210
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,720
Thank you for your time and cooperation,
Madam Acting President.

211
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,280
It's contingent.

212
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,117
The minister won't proceed
with our tariff deal

213
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,245
if we don't give him assurances
that the rescue is underway.

214
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,415
Why do the Chinese care so much
about what's on this Russian boat?

215
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,085
I don't know. I was just informed myself.

216
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,503
Are they working together?

217
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,422
Again, I don't know.

218
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,134
Are you working with them?

219
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,220
I work with everybody.

220
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,682
But that's beside the point.
There is an American on board.

221
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,184
And you believe that?

222
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,687
Well, you wouldn't want to make
the wrong call.

223
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,984
Bull's balls.

224
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,112
A giant crow.

225
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,865
And billionaires chanting, "Set me free."

226
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,453
Well, this place says everything I feel,
but can't express.

227
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,167
He can't be your friend.

228
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,836
Tusk doesn't have any friends.

229
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,590
He's, uh, an associate.

230
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,593
- Really?
- Mmm.

231
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,928
And how does he associate with you?

232
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,435
Oh, to hell with the buzzing bees.
No one else is heeding it.

233
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,106
A network president, a telecom CEO,
the vice presidential candidate.

234
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,149
What do you think
they're all talking about,

235
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,943
the last book they read?
- What are you reading?

236
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,614
Your face...

237
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,159
which tells me how much
you don't want to be here.

238
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,998
Mr. Tusk was a major donor
on Will's campaign.

239
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,502
Yes, so it's interesting
that he wasn't invited.

240
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,922
We're partnering on a project.

241
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,801
Large-scale data storage centers
in the desert.

242
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,470
Solar-powered.

243
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,724
I need to get ready for my talk.

244
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,727
What We Leave Behind."

245
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,062
Hope you'll be there.

246
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,112
Smell that.

247
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,531
Cohiba.

248
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,284
I know you're a fan.

249
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,371
Even though I don't smoke anymore,
doesn't mean I can't...

250
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,540
Who called this weekend's gathering? You?

251
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,168
No. Tusk did.

252
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,547
- Why?
- Hmm.

253
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:56,260
We think the Chinese are right.
There is an American on board.

254
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,721
This is Thad Peterson.
Retired two years ago.

255
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,475
Director of geophysics research for
some of the country's top oil companies.

256
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,394
We strongly suspect
he's on board the boat.

257
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,103
Working with the Russians.

258
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,275
Where's the proof?

259
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,277
This was sent
from a Russian sailor's cell phone

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,237
before communications were cut off.

261
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,285
Get on the radio
and call for help!

262
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,997
His wife confirmed that this is
Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.

263
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,794
In 24, 36 hours tops,
that boat's gone.

264
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,715
Yes, but that doesn't prove
that Thad Peterson was on the ship.

265
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,471
But, ma'am...
he is an American...

266
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,599
No, we can't be sure until
we have a passenger manifest.

267
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,892
Let's reconvene when you know more.

268
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,653
- What is it, Cathy?
- Your decision not to intervene.

269
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,991
If an American is working illegally,
he will not be on the manifest...

270
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,203
I haven't made a decision.
I'm waiting for more information.

271
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
This is about Aidan Macallan.

272
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:13,254
I am very confident China is lying
about an American being on board.

273
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,506
There is something on that boat they want

274
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,966
and I can't proceed
until I know what it is.

275
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,262
They say they're motivated
by saving human lives.

276
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,929
But that's not what's driving them.

277
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:29,311
And I just find it so frustrating when
human life is treated with such disregard.

278
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,897
We're sorry.

279
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,942
The proverbial walk in the woods
is not for me.

280
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,737
Navel-gazing on some forest path.

281
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,533
Contemplating mortality. Immortality.

282
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,952
No. History is earned.

283
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,455
You win the day,
and then you win the day after,

284
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,999
and you do the same thing
every day until you're dead.

285
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,920
And you're remembered not for the winning,
but because you never lost.

286
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,172
Now...

287
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,262
Doug?

288
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,722
Doug, can you hear me?

289
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
I need some leverage out here right now.

290
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,770
- What's going on?
- Conway is finished.

291
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,896
If they win,

292
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,958
Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.
He'll essentially be the president.

293
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:17,526
We should have used the oppo.

294
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,446
Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.

295
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,365
I need to find a way to force
that old man to support me.

296
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,285
- Sir? Mr. President?
- Do you hear me?

297
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,543
...I'm here.

298
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,589
Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.
I need to find a way to stop that.

299
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,173
An executive order...

300
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:41,967
Ah!

301
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,722
Sir?

302
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,352
A little restraint...

303
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,521
would be unexpected.

304
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,275
Mr. President?

305
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,069
- Doug.
- Sir?

306
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,321
Don't do anything.

307
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,656
I don't understand.

308
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,950
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

309
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:10,454
- Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal?
- Do you hear me?

310
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,831
- Don't do anything...
- Mr. President, I...

311
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,763
- Have you tried calling him back?
- There's no answer. What should we do?

312
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,599
Nothing. That's what the president said,
so that's what we'll do.

313
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,059
- Should we have his team pull him out?
- No. We wait.

314
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,147
Ma'am... if we don't handle
this rescue correctly...

315
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,065
Doug.

316
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,585
Let me find a way to get the president
on the phone with Petrov.

317
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,653
No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.

318
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,779
I disagree.

319
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,280
I know you do.

320
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,367
They say we're only
remembered for three generations.

321
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,871
What would one have to do
not to be forgotten?

322
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,291
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.

323
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,461
Who cares if he's never
heard of Johnny Carson?

324
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:06,092
Poor old Tusk. He wears that game face,
but he doesn't fool me.

325
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,138
The future terrifies him
because he knows it's short.

326
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,766
For the record,
I have heard of Johnny Carson.

327
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,684
Ah.

328
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,436
He tucked my parents
into bed every night.

329
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:25,446
I've been given special permission
to show you what we've been working on.

330
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:30,241
Imagine the possibility of your brain,
your consciousness,

331
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,453
stored digitally in real time.

332
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,663
I mean, what is immortality?

333
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,291
In time, even Grant's vision will get old.

334
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:42,295
It will happen, as it does for all of us.

335
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:46,883
Now this is still in the early stages,
but we've been collecting and storing

336
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,679
Raymond's memories,
thoughts, quirks and tics.

337
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,475
This is a mock-up. But eventually...

338
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:03,316
this Raymond... will feel as real
as the one standing before you.

339
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,362
I like dirt and rocks...

340
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,699
and facts.

341
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,578
No argument here.

342
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,039
I trust only what I can hold in my hand
or see on my horizon.

343
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,627
Well, but you can't just sit back
and admire the view.

344
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,338
I've learned you've got to grab
the present by the balls.

345
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,423
That's where the American people live.

346
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,511
You sound more like a salesman
than a president, Mr. President.

347
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,304
Well, if we're Americans,
then we are salesmen, right?

348
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,684
That's our birthright.
Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.

349
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,435
That's not how I see America.

350
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,897
I'm a patriot. I serve.

351
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,400
Well, then, we salute you, General.
But you serve to what purpose?

352
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,236
So the rest of America can sell.

353
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,906
I mean, you and I,
right now, this weekend,

354
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,575
we're here at this camp selling ourselves.

355
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,663
Character speaks for itself.

356
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,414
People want a president they can trust.

357
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,125
No, they don't.
They want a president they know.

358
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,670
And I know them.

359
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:08,632
The only future I'm interested in
is the next four years.

360
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,677
So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow
and the day after that

361
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,303
and the day after that.

362
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,222
I'm selling a boy
who used to live on a peach farm

363
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,349
who now lives in the White House.

364
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:24,397
I'm selling a tomorrow that you can see
and touch and feel.

365
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:29,110
Now, you take that away, and I don't know
what this country has left.

366
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,613
Except a group of grown men

367
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,659
standing around in a circle,
all staring at a small screen.

368
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,911
Looking in instead of looking out.

369
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,289
Heck, give me a peck of dirt
any day of the week.

370
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,919
Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.

371
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,004
- Hear, hear.
- I will drink to that,

372
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,968
but I will also drink to the general,
a good servant.

373
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,510
To the general.

374
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,350
I promise you, this deal is
on the verge of falling apart.

375
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,560
Right before your revote.

376
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,896
I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.

377
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,149
We can't let this deal fall apart.

378
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,820
Agreed.
But the rescue has to happen immediately.

379
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,740
You seem personally invested in this.

380
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,118
Oh, no, no.
I'm just looking for a solution.

381
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:22,623
I had a thought.

382
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,752
I would be willing
to allow the Chinese sailors

383
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,964
that are stationed on King George Island
to board our icebreaker.

384
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,383
Then, purely for the in-house cameras,

385
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,386
we let it appear as though
the Chinese led the rescue.

386
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,471
Now, of course, the whole time,
the Americans

387
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,223
would remain in charge of the boat,

388
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:43,184
but the Russians don't need to know
our involvement.

389
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,771
I imagine that would be acceptable.

390
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,066
I'll relay this scenario
to Mr. Xu immediately.

391
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,528
But I'd also like to round up
the tariff to 20%.

392
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,365
We have a firm deal at 19.

393
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,702
I know. But suddenly,
it just doesn't seem high enough.

394
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,455
I think they'll be okay with it.

395
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,044
Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.

396
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,089
- That went rather well, I think.
- It did. It went very well.

397
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,925
You've exceeded everyone's expectations,

398
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,427
the way you handled yourself
all weekend, but...

399
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,143
Brockhart's someone they can predict.

400
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,939
Don't get ahead of yourself.
This is not over.

401
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,482
What are you gonna do, Francis?
Are you gonna use the oppo?

402
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,402
Well, it seems to have worried you enough.

403
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:36,654
He's still only
the vice presidential candidate.

404
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm leaving.

405
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,535
- You don't have to go.
- No, I know. I don't have to do anything.

406
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,416
Do you remember when we first met?
You almost joined my second campaign.

407
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,044
We sat down at that little greasy spoon
in Gaffney.

408
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,797
Yeah, if you'd signed me on,
you would have won by a landslide.

409
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,300
I won anyway, because I never lose.

410
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,386
You know why I didn't hire you back then?

411
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,263
Because when you went
to pick up the check,

412
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,850
you told me I didn't have to pay you.

413
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,937
That you would work for free.
I don't trust that.

414
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,022
Because no one works for free.

415
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:17,320
Madam President,
I'm afraid I can't agree to 20%.

416
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:20,323
- The economic implications...
- We're at an impasse.

417
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,576
I'm willing to keep
the conversation going,

418
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,788
but in the meantime...
- We'll do nothing until you agree.

419
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,000
Madam President, people will die.

420
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,794
Which is why I'm surprised
you won't agree to my terms.

421
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,755
I can't agree to the terms
without the approval

422
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,424
of my State Councillor
for Foreign Affairs.

423
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,889
There are 112 people aboard the vessel.

424
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,224
113 if you count Mr. Peterson.

425
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:51,021
Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.

426
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,483
The temperature of the Southern Ocean
right now is 28 degrees Fahrenheit.

427
00:28:55,566 --> 00:29:01,281
A body will freeze to death
within 45 minutes in water that cold.

428
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,743
And, of course, one loses
the ability to swim long before that.

429
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,498
Minister Xu, are you still there?

430
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,880
Collaborating with President Petrov
is always a mistake.

431
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,841
The 20% tariff will help you
keep that in mind.

432
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,177
I'm waiting.

433
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,388
It's up to you if they live or die.

434
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,982
- The crew?
- All rescued.

435
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,029
- And Thad Peterson?
- You were right. The Chinese were lying.

436
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,656
He's the only one still unaccounted for.

437
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,912
The admiral says there's still a chance
to save the boat.

438
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,584
Let it go down.

439
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:59,464
- And whatever Petrov has on it?
- We're doing the right thing, Cathy.

440
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,343
You got what you wanted, Viktor.

441
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,512
The boat is gone.
Now let's get back to where we left off.

442
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,683
What will it take to get Aidan Macallan
back on American soil?

443
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,563
He likes it here.

444
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,704
Leaving, Mr. President?

445
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,168
You can put that in the car, thank you.

446
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,257
- Are you all right?
- Better now.

447
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,218
Are you drunk?

448
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,138
- You want a pull?
- No.

449
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,224
I hate this place.

450
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:52,976
These men.

451
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,855
Their privilege, their presumption.

452
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,025
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.

453
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,986
Do you know...

454
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,322
Raymond wants to be frozen?

455
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,450
Put on ice until a later date.

456
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,079
- I have to get going.
- Will Conway's my friend. But...

457
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,124
this won't end well for him if he wins.

458
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,169
- You take care of yourself, Ben.

459
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,546
They have a recording of him.

460
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,509
I'll be right there in a minute.

461
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,897
You have to promise me

462
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,400
Will Conway never finds out
this came from me.

463
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,627
You know
I'm gonna be the president, right?

464
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,339
- I hope so, sir.
- You hope so?

465
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,466
I just mean
I'm pulling for you, sir.

466
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,842
I'm gonna be the president,

467
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,470
and you're gonna flip me
those motherfucking controls...

468
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,554
Sir!

469
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:13,889
I think this must have been
recorded by the pilot.

470
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,101
We should go
to MSNBC and CNN first.

471
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,478
- We can go wide.
- No, let's wait.

472
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,108
Francis, you heard what I heard.

473
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,610
And it'll be just as good tomorrow.

474
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,071
Have Doyle confirm it.
I'll see you in the morning.

475
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,203
...Why not do it now?

476
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,705
We need to wait for the president.

477
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,583
Stories are still swirling

478
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,962
around the events leading up
to a daring Chinese-led rescue

479
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,565
of the crew of a Russian research ship

480
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,509
stuck in ice for almost four days
off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.

481
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,387
Although the ship was lost,
every crew member was saved.

482
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,972
Russian President Viktor Petrov

483
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,558
expressed his gratitude
to the Chinese government this morning.

484
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,313
Exhaustion must be
catching up with the candidates,

485
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,775
as President Underwood
and his running mate took the weekend off.

486
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,237
General Brockhart was nowhere to be seen,
while only Governor Conway

487
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,839
made a pair of quick appearances...
- Hey.

488
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,407
...in the Cleveland area.

489
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,581
- That tap water is gonna kill you.
- There are worse ways to go.

490
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,794
I have a confession.

491
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,965
What'd you do?

492
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:37,682
I've had somebody watch you sometimes
when you go to New York.

493
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,397
Her name's Karen.

494
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,777
Who is she?

495
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,365
I don't know you get to ask that.

496
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,786
She was my teacher.

497
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,541
Theology, among other things.

498
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:11,174
I don't know why I did that.
It's not... about jealousy.

499
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,136
She saved my life, actually.

500
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,888
I'm glad.

501
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,063
Well, we won't be seeing Karen
for a while.

502
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,277
She knows me.
She could see how I feel about you.

503
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,785
Ma'am, an initialed agreement.

504
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,875
What exactly was on that boat, Jane?

505
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,922
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians had
access to technology they shouldn't have

506
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,799
and didn't want to lose.

507
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,343
And now they've lost it.

508
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,096
What aren't you telling me?

509
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:03,726
What did you want
out of all of this?

510
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,687
I told you what I wanted.

511
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,440
I wanted that American off the boat.

512
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,945
He was the technology.

513
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,121
Here, give me that.

514
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,457
Go.

515
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,764
Tom Hammerschmidt.

516
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,646
Detective, I got the drive.

517
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,775
Uh, no, I just put it in.

518
00:35:54,402 --> 00:36:01,367
And... the time stamp says
November 3rd, 2013, 8:13 p.m.

519
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,869
Hold on a second. You all right?

520
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,290
Yeah. I just need to get out for a minute.

521
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,503
I'm here.

522
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:18,384
I know. I know you're busy.
And I can't thank you enough, I...

523
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,721
Let me back you up a bit.

524
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,686
Okay, so this is two days before she died.

525
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,482
The governor sounds unhinged.

526
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,985
It bothers me, though.
It came too easy, don't you think?

527
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,446
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.

528
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,781
I don't know, Claire.
You know these types of people.

529
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,241
You should have been there.

530
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,620
Why would they hand me...
He just handed me this. Why?

531
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,788
When they've never wanted me,
not from the beginning,

532
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,332
no matter what I do!

533
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,213
- Fuck 'em.
- I intend to.

534
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,758
And how do you intend to do that?

535
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm going back to work.

536
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,766
I'm going back to work.

537
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,729
We're glad you came.

538
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,649
I hear those weekends can,
uh, take some recovery time.

539
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,986
I must say, I didn't expect
to be back here so soon.

540
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,449
Well, Mark, we asked you
back here because...

541
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,912
we've come into possession
of a second audio recording

542
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,164
of your candidate on an airplane.

543
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,084
- He's been recorded saying...
- I know what he said.

544
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
I was there.

545
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,887
So, we were wondering
if we can discuss how...

546
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,307
we might be able to work together.

547
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,560
We can accomplish a great deal.
The three of us.

548
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,062
Now, before you say anything,

549
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,398
let me tell you
how this conversation's going to go.

550
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,483
You're going to talk about party loyalty,

551
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,611
and I'm going to talk about
how weak your candidates are

552
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,280
and that you really have no choice.

553
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:06,451
And then you're going to say
that your ticket can still win Ohio.

554
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,870
And I'm going to say, "No, they can't."

555
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,499
But what's going to go unsaid
in this conversation

556
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,751
is that Claire and I...

557
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,590
are willing... to do anything.

558
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,762
And we know... that you are no different.

559
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,701
Okay, I can start by setting up
some meetings for both of you.

560
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,870
I can't do that publicly, of course.

561
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,667
I suggest you release
whatever you have slowly. One at a time.

562
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,795
Let's make this build.

563
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,256
Once it gets out,

564
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,843
I'll make sure the Republicans don't come
to my candidate's defense.

565
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,476
I was in a really bad place.

566
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,313
I couldn't do anything.

567
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,234
I couldn't leave my apartment.

568
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,529
Why?

569
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,909
It's mysterious, isn't it,
when these things happen?

570
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,952
Or maybe it never happened to you.

571
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,205
But I woke up one day and it felt like...

572
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,002
everything I contemplated doing,
everything,

573
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:42,797
from going to the coffee shop...

574
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,385
to... reading a book,
writing a chapter, it was just...

575
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,555
laughable.

576
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,224
As in?

577
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,479
As in... pointless.

578
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,233
And Karen, bless her...

579
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,488
she helped me find a point.
Or, not find one.

580
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,659
Realize the possibility of one.

581
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,664
Were you together?

582
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,374
Yeah. We were married.

583
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,504
For about three years.
A million years ago.

584
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,132
She's a good person.

585
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:31,261
She's just... having a hard time.
So I'm trying to help her.

586
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,311
- Find a point?
- Mmm-hmm.

587
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,192
You ever been that dark?

588
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:51,198
I wanna be with you.

589
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,830
I love you.

590
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,585
I think I might love you, too.

591
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,928
That's the script for the 30-second spot.

592
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,239
We don't wanna hit him too hard.

593
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,641
There's a risk of kicking him
while he's down.

594
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,142
Who's doing the morning shows?

595
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,104
Friends. They'll respectfully question
Conway's ability to serve.

596
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:23,606
And then in the nightly news,

597
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,526
we'll have veteran rights activists
arguing for better care.

598
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,735
Good.

599
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,571
Sir, the plan is
to go after the governor first,

600
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,865
and when the general comes to his defense,

601
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,660
we use his hot mic comments
to take him down, too.

602
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:40,080
Congratulations, sir.

603
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,190
I wanted to be the first to say it.

604
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,085
We still have to campaign.

605
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,798
Yeah, but you're going to win.

606
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,217
We are, Doug.

607
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,304
We are.

608
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,718
Common woe, be done.
