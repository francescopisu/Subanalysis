1
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:13,170
Over 20 years?

2
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:16,568
Thirty?

3
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,320
Forty?

4
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:21,448
- How about fifty?
- Fifty-five.

5
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,825
Fifty-five years. Wow.

6
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:27,954
And what is your name, ma'am?

7
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:30,499
- Agnes.
- Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes.

8
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:33,001
Yes. Yes, I do.

9
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,462
Well, Francis and I
are only halfway there,

10
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,798
but I bet you know your husband
as well as you know yourself.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,382
- Am I right?
- Yes, I do.

12
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,636
Well, I know Francis Underwood.

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,722
I know what keeps him up at night.

14
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:48,849
And I'm sure it's the same thing
that keeps your husbands up, too.

15
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,188
The future. How can I ensure
a better future for my family?

16
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:57,066
Except... Francis, as President...

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,987
his focus is on the progress
of all American families.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,489
You know what he said to me last night?

19
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:06,868
He said, "Claire, my entire presidential
agenda, it's very simple.

20
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,580
I want to be able to look
every single American in the eye,

21
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,957
and know that I have made
their lives better."

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,794
Yes.

23
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,464
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood,
I find you very charming.

24
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,800
And you seem quite honest.

25
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:26,555
But I have trouble believing that your
husband truly cares about people.

26
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:30,183
Well, Francis Underwood is a good man.

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,893
He's dedicated and generous.

28
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:35,522
And I have 28 years of proof.

29
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,692
And I can honestly say,
even if I wasn't married to him,

30
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,527
he would definitely have my vote.

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,529
Thank you.

32
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,948
Negligence. Nepotism.

33
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,243
Misappropriation of federal funds.

34
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:52,831
A foreign policy fiasco
and loose with the truth.

35
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:54,708
What do these five fingers
have in common?

36
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,668
Francis J. Underwood.

37
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,545
Mr. King, I would
like to respond to that.

38
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:01,715
This is a man who believes
in the rule of law-ish.

39
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:06,094
The legislative process-ish.
The Constitution-ish.

40
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,679
Is this the man who should be president?

41
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:12,726
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer,
you have a knack for rhetoric-ish.

42
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,228
But the American people
are tired of words.

43
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,939
What they crave is action.

44
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,483
My concern about focusing
on the word, "action,"

45
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,445
is that she'll just
come back with failed actions.

46
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:25,154
America Works, the UN mission.

47
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:28,241
"Action" performed well
with key demos in our last poll.

48
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:30,535
Yes, but doesn't this
take us off message?

49
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,414
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank
Underwood is a vote for America Works."

50
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,082
That's what we've been running on.

51
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,710
You need a word
that goes beyond America Works.

52
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:41,880
- Something that can be used for anything.
- Remy, what do you think?

53
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:45,341
- Uh...
- We're talking about the word, "action."

54
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,553
Sorry, I was, uh... My mind was
on the foreign policy argument.

55
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,306
- I was just thinking ahead.
- What about "vision"?

56
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,141
Isn't that too generic?

57
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:55,477
That's what we want.
I mean, the more generic, the better.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,229
People can project anything
they want on "vision."

59
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:01,524
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.
We should work on Sharp next.

60
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,943
You want me to play her?

61
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,654
Thank you for taking your role
so seriously, Donald.

62
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:07,988
You should consider
a career on the stage.

63
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:11,159
Because he sure as hell
isn't gonna be on my ticket.

64
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,707
You're good at this.
They loved you.

65
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,585
Three decades of campaigns,
you learn how to read an audience.

66
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,713
Self-promotion gives me hives.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

67
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,924
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.

68
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,510
That's a convenient way to spin it,
don't you think?

69
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:30,887
Are you always this blunt?

70
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,556
I only have two days to tag along.

71
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,434
Mind if I ride with you,
since we have so little time?

72
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:39,479
I need to make some calls.
Maybe we'll find some time later.

73
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,536
Remy, you were distracted earlier.
What's going on?

74
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,621
Oh. Nothing. Everything's good.

75
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,247
I need you on your A-game, Remy.

76
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,625
This debate could make us
the front-runner.

77
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,378
It's just between the campaign
and managing the White House,

78
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,588
- I'm a little burnt out.
- We still have months to go.

79
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:08,758
- A year before the general.
- It's temporary. I'll get past it.

80
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,510
If you can do it, I can.

81
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,013
Gavin?

82
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,682
- Hello, Douglas.
- What do you want?

83
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,643
You still can't believe she's dead,
can you?

84
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:05,231
Well, you shouldn't.
'Cause she's not.

85
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,901
She's alive,
and I know exactly where she is.

86
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,820
I've known for a while.

87
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,655
- What?
- Look on your laptop.

88
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,797
No, you...
you showed me the picture.

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,424
- Of her body.
- That wasn't her.

90
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:34,510
I forged it all so you'd
lift my passport lock.

91
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,639
Well, I'm out now, Doug.

92
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:41,017
And I'm safe. But my friend isn't.

93
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,644
Talk to Green.

94
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,730
Get him the same deal you got me,
all charges dropped.

95
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,900
You do that,
and I'll tell you where she is.

96
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,157
Ah!

97
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:27,940

98
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,334
- Hey, Meechum.
- Sir.

99
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,585
Mr. President.

100
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,130
Thank you for coming
all the way to Andrews.

101
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:00,382
Did Remy walk you
through the broad strokes?

102
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,969
No matter the policy question,
foreign or domestic,

103
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,846
we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.

104
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,350
We bludgeon it. We cannot say
"lack of experience" enough.

105
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,853
And no doubt, she'll bring up
Claire's recess appointment,

106
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,772
where I can't take the bait,
so I leave that entirely to you.

107
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,192
This was one of the things
that I was hoping to discuss.

108
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,860
Oh, you don't want to call her "sexist"?

109
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:21,779
- The argument doesn't hold.
- It does hold.

110
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,906
She says that Claire was unqualified.

111
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,909
You say she wouldn't say that
about a man with the same CV.

112
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,369
I'm not sure that's true.

113
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,080
And calling another woman sexist
when there's a man on the stage--

114
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:35,126
And who else is better but you to call
her out on what she's done for women,

115
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,752
which is absolutely nothing?

116
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:40,882
Whereas gender-equality legislation
is one of your hallmarks.

117
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:42,884
But it could hurt me
more than it hurts her.

118
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,887
I thought we had an understanding.

119
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,389
You were gonna play pit bull
while I play presidential.

120
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,850
Will you get a little bloody?
Yes, probably.

121
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,727
But that's what people want
in their debates.

122
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,730
And then you and I together,
we bury her.

123
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:58,858
You drop out next week,
endorse me and the race is over.

124
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,943
I have no problem being forceful.

125
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,988
But this sexism thing,
and the whole school argument, I--

126
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,908
- Oh. You mean her kids.
- I really don't want to involve them.

127
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,827
We have two things we want
the American people to hear:

128
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:13,497
she lacks experience and she was born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

129
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:14,999
But there has to be another way.

130
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,459
She wants to trumpet
an equal playing field?

131
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:20,213
Then why does she send her own kids
to private school?

132
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:24,466
That is a clear and simple argument that
everyone can get their heads around.

133
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,012
And it doesn't hurt that Iowa's biggest
employer is the public school system.

134
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:30,390
Alan sends his kids to private school.

135
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,017
Yeah, but they're not your kids.

136
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,270
They're my step-kids.
And that makes me a hypocrite.

137
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,150
Is that really
what you're concerned about?

138
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:43,069
Being a hypocrite?

139
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,530
It's my family.

140
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:50,576
Oh, trust me, they'll understand
the moment they step into the White House.

141
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,828
Jackie, I really
shouldn't have to convince you

142
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,373
to do what it takes to get a set of keys.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,961
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.

144
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,629
Thank you, Jackie.

145
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,675
- Are we all clear?
- The press has boarded, sir.

146
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,677
- All right, make sure no one sees her.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,180
Flight time to
Des Moines today will be two hours...

148
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:16,227
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism
gets weighed down by family values.

149
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,562
Without her doctor
and his pimply-faced brood,

150
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,982
she could soar as high as this plane.

151
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,652
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea.
Don't remind me.

152
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,747
- Doug.
- Hey.

153
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,083
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

154
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,877
What, did you get
locked out or something?

155
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:45,340
I felt the need to drink.

156
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,800
I got this far and I stopped myself.

157
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,429
Okay.

158
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,222
I wanted you to see it.

159
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,391
That I could control it.

160
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,272
You wanna go back up?

161
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,065
Yeah.

162
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,417
I know it looks crazy.

163
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,086
But I had to do it.

164
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,587
Why?

165
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:30,926
There was this girl...
before the injury.

166
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:35,806
She left me.
So I started drinking.

167
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,018
I tried to shut her out,

168
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,688
but I just kept checking my e-mails,
my text messages.

169
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:47,567
It needed to stop.

170
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,362
Who was she?

171
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:55,034
You know what? That's okay.

172
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,494
Doesn't matter.

173
00:12:58,037 --> 00:13:01,874
What matters is that you got pushed
to the edge today and you didn't fall off.

174
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,793
You did what you had to do.

175
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:07,922
I don't judge you for it.

176
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,509
And I don't think it's crazy.

177
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:41,705
We could've met somewhere
a little warmer.

178
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:44,750
Walmart wanted to knock this down,
build a store here.

179
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,044
- But the community put a stop to it.
- I know.

180
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:50,923
Because they wouldn't give a tax credit
unless entry-level wages were higher.

181
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,050
So which is better?
A shitty job, or no job?

182
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:55,761
- Well, I think I know your answer.
- Don't be so sure.

183
00:13:55,844 --> 00:14:00,682
Jackie, you have repeatedly opposed
the minimum-wage and CEO salary bill

184
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,562
- I asked the leadership to introduce.
- I've put a lot of thought into it.

185
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,147
This community took a stand.

186
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,150
If enough of them do, Congress
won't have a choice but to act.

187
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,901
Are we here to talk about legislation?

188
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,653
Because we both
have a debate in six hours.

189
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,074
I want to endorse you.

190
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:21,496
I'll lay off you tonight.
You and I attack Underwood.

191
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,957
In three days,
I'll drop out and endorse.

192
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,043
- We haven't even had the first caucus.
- You two are neck-and-neck.

193
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,963
I have 14 points in Iowa,
twelve in New Hampshire.

194
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:35,217
You get my people,
you have a clear win in both states.

195
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,179
My endorsement is valuable.

196
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:39,721
How much does Underwood value it?

197
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,682
- Highly.
- What did he offer you?

198
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,355
I'm more interested
in what you have to offer.

199
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,940
Did he promise a cabinet position?

200
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,403
More than that?

201
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:59,617
He offered to put you
on the ticket, didn't he?

202
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,785
I wouldn't expect to be
on your ticket, Heather.

203
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,205
You need a Southerner with a penis.

204
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:07,082
I was thinking Secretary of Defense,
given my war record.

205
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,502
But I'd be open to other ideas.

206
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:15,508
I would love your support, Jackie,
but I offer you nothing.

207
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,887
But... this is an easy win.

208
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,139
I'm not gonna start
selling off cabinet positions

209
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,974
before I've won the White House.

210
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,269
Those decisions will be
based purely on merit.

211
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:32,567
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination
for you, I deserve to be compensated.

212
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,320
I plan on winning, Jackie.
Just... not your way.

213
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:39,323
And with or without your support.

214
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,409
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.

215
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,536
You do what you have to do.

216
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,682
Is Jackie in here?

217
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,434
Hi, Bob.

218
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,893
- Hi.
- Hi.

219
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,311
Sorry I'm late.

220
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,564
- How did your surgery go?
- Terrible.

221
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,857
The patient almost didn't make it.

222
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,151
- But he's alive?
- She. And yeah.

223
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,112
- Stable condition.
- Oh...

224
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,155
It means so much to me that you came.

225
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,741
All done.

226
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:24,159
- Do you like?
- It's good. Thank you.

227
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:30,040
- So, how'd it go with--?
- Thanks.

228
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:37,465
- What'd she offer?
- Nothing.

229
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:40,259
- Nothing at all?
- I know, I was surprised, too.

230
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,177
It's foolish. She could lock this up.

231
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:46,390
I have to say,
I almost... respect it.

232
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:48,684
Anyway, you were right.

233
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:50,852
Stick with the devil you know.

234
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,857
Are the kids watching tonight?

235
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,819
Yeah. They've got all their friends
over at the house.

236
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,156
Listen, the ki--

237
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,783
What?

238
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:08,870
Nothing. How do I look?

239
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:13,083
I'd throw you on that bed right now
if it wouldn't mess up your hair.

240
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:16,712
Mm...

241
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,798
Watch me prep.

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,967
You can mess up my hair all you want
after the debate.

243
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,101
- She's here.
- There she is.

244
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,238
Quiet, guys. Quiet, guys.
Here she comes.

245
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:47,242
Quiet, quiet!

246
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,460
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, everyone!

247
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,464
Thank all of you so very much

248
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,133
for working so hard to make sure
we take New Hampshire.

249
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:09,056
It is field offices like this
that win primaries,

250
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:12,309
and the president wants you to know
how much your dedication means to us.

251
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:14,102
Thank you so much. Thank you.

252
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,315
- Now, who's ready to watch a debate?
- Yeah!

253
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,735
There is a large crowd here
in Sioux City tonight.

254
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,904
I would say potential voters,
but of course, here in Iowa,

255
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,324
citizens caucus instead of vote,
and many of the people here in this room

256
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,536
will be doing just that on January 15th.

257
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,623
A CNN ORC poll has it as a tight race
between the two front-runners.

258
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,292
Heather Dunbar at 32 percent.

259
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,628
President Frank Underwood at 30 percent.

260
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,674
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails
in third at 14 percent.

261
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,301
Twenty-two percent remain undecided.

262
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,178
You can switch it.

263
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,680
Really?

264
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,391
- Unless you want to watch.
- No, I thought you would.

265
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,643
It's your last night here.

266
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,564
I want to spend it with my brother,
not Frank Underwood.

267
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,649
What do you want to watch instead?

268
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,402
Anything. Whatever you want.

269
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:06,655
...promising universal employment,
and on Israeli Palestinian relations...

270
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:10,158
Oh, shit.
Have you ever seen Contagion?

271
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:11,702
No.

272
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,496
If you're a clean freak, this'll
definitely make you a germ freak.

273
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,374
- I love this movie.
- Go for it.

274
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:29,052
Welcome to the first Democratic
nomination debate hosted by CNN.

275
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:32,973
Our candidates tonight: Frank Underwood,
Jackie Sharp, and Heather Dunbar.

276
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,225
I'm John King and
I'll be your moderator tonight.

277
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,060
Our debate will be divided in two parts,

278
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:39,814
the first part focusing
on foreign policy,

279
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,190
part two focusing
on the domestic agenda.

280
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:46,904
And our format will be as follows:
I will ask one candidate a question.

281
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:49,197
That candidate will have
one minute to answer.

282
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,242
After that, all of our candidates
can engage in an open conversation

283
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:55,496
lasting for five minutes.
We begin, though, with opening statements.

284
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:58,833
And by lottery, it was decided
that President Underwood goes first.

285
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,251
- Mr. President.
- Thank you. And good evening, John,

286
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:05,631
good evening to my fellow candidates,
and to the good people of Sioux City.

287
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:09,343
This nomination comes down
to one word: vision.

288
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:12,847
I believe that I have shown
a clear vision to this country

289
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,475
with America Works,
the most comprehensive jobs program

290
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,226
in nearly a century.

291
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,896
We showed it could work
in Washington DC.

292
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,984
We need now to take what we did there
and spread it nationwide,

293
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,737
so that the American dream
can become the American reality.

294
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:32,700
But that vision isn't enough on its own.

295
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:36,495
You need someone
with experience to make it happen.

296
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:39,498
And between my time in Congress
and now at the White House,

297
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:43,418
I have more experience than
both of my opponents combined.

298
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:46,005
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job,

299
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:48,549
are you gonna hire someone
with 30 years' experience,

300
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:52,594
or someone with less than ten
or someone with no experience at all?

301
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:57,016
Where I come from down south, we call
that as clear as a glass of moonshine.

302
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,188
Former Solicitor General
Dunbar is next.

303
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,524
- Your opening statement, please.
- Thank you, John.

304
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,317
And thank you Iowa.

305
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,905
Well, I agree with the president.

306
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:14,992
Vision and experience
are exactly what America needs.

307
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:19,496
Unfortunately, he has the wrong vision
and horrendous experience.

308
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,667
You can call America Works visionary,
but in truth,

309
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:27,838
it is just an ultra-conservative agenda
that's been around for decades.

310
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:31,341
Dismantle the safety net
and hang people out to dry.

311
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:34,929
As for the president's experience,
he was in the leadership

312
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:39,058
during one of the most ineffective
decades in Congressional history.

313
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,185
As president, he has failed
at everything he's done.

314
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,482
America Works was illegal in the minds
of many legal experts, myself included.

315
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,318
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.

316
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:52,404
If that's what you call experience,

317
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:56,575
you're not just padding the résumé,
you are fabricating it.

318
00:21:56,658 --> 00:22:00,579
President Underwood
isn't presenting us with a vision,

319
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:04,332
he is convincing himself
of his own delusion.

320
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,587
Now, my vision
is to tackle corporate greed,

321
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,839
raise pay for those who need it most,

322
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,759
and create jobs by growing the economy,

323
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:17,054
not robbing people
of their retirement and health care.

324
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:22,392
My experience is 20 years
defending the Constitution.

325
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:27,564
You know when I take my presidential
oath, I will mean every word of it.

326
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,821
Ms. Dunbar, thank you.
Congresswoman Sharp,

327
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:36,115
- your opening statement, please.
- Thank you.

328
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:39,534
As many of you know,
I am a US Army veteran.

329
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:43,413
Now, I've seen firsthand
the great sacrifices

330
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:47,084
my fellow servicemen and women
have made defending this country.

331
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:51,296
But how can we ask them
to protect a system

332
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,340
that isn't protecting us?

333
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,716
Take women, for example.

334
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,594
There are two women
at this debate running for president.

335
00:22:57,678 --> 00:23:01,431
That's extraordinary.
But out in the general workforce?

336
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:05,978
Women earn 77 cents
on the dollar compared to men.

337
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:10,983
Even worse is minority women
earning 67 cents on the dollar.

338
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:15,362
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk
about balancing the scales,

339
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:18,991
but she inherited
a multi-billion-dollar fortune

340
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:22,452
and never had to earn
any cents on the dollar.

341
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:26,373
Now, I don't agree with everything
that President Underwood has done

342
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:30,335
or proposes, but at least he knows
what it means to work for a living.

343
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:32,754
I can give you even better than that.

344
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:35,924
I know what it means
to fight for a living.

345
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:39,469
And I will fight
for fairness here at home

346
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:42,639
just as fiercely as
I fought our enemies overseas.

347
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,892
Thank you.

348
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:47,895
Thank you, Congresswoman.
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.

349
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:50,105
And the first question
is for you, Mr. President.

350
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:53,400
Given the recent volatile events
in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe

351
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:56,695
it was correct to assemble the United
Nations coalition and to intervene,

352
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,614
or is it time now
to call that intervention a mistake?

353
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:02,576
Well, I will answer that question, John,
but I'd like to address first

354
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,912
something Ms. Dunbar said
a few moments ago.

355
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:08,540
America Works is not some stale,
old, conservative agenda.

356
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:12,794
You name me one Republican
who has suggested using federal funds

357
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:18,217
to guarantee jobs for every American
who wants one and I will eat my hat.

358
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,719
This isn't about dismantling government.
It is about--

359
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:23,805
Aren't we supposed to be talking
about foreign policy?

360
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,391
Yeah, I will.
But first, I'd like to correct--

361
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:28,727
Because it's easier
to talk about America Works

362
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,771
than to defend your
indefensible UN mission.

363
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:32,731
At least I have a record
to defend, Ms. Dunbar.

364
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:34,608
Speaking of your record, Mr. President,

365
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:37,861
you went on record saying
you wouldn't run for president.

366
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:39,780
- And yet here you are.
- John, it seems that

367
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:41,865
your very thoughtful rules
have gone out the window.

368
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,784
You have no respect for rules,
Mr. President.

369
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,535
Take FEMA, for example.

370
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,163
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now
instead of foreign policy.

371
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:49,957
I am just following your lead, sir.

372
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,252
See what a mess we get into when
we follow your brand of leadership?

373
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,590
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar
does have many years of experience

374
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:01,300
making rhetorical arguments in court.

375
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:04,096
You've just seen proof of that today.

376
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:07,515
But serving the American people
is not about what you say,

377
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,184
it's about what you do.

378
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:12,146
And I would ask:
what have you ever done?

379
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:16,108
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's
lack of experience is a concern.

380
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,235
I find it ironic
that the president talks about

381
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,570
the importance of experience,
given the fact

382
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,906
that he appointed his wife
UN ambassador

383
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,743
- despite her utter lack of credentials.
- That's a sexist comment.

384
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,703
Excuse me?

385
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,329
You wouldn't be making that argument

386
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:33,458
if a female president
had appointed her husband.

387
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,377
A husband with the same lack
of international affairs experience

388
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:38,379
as Claire Underwood?
Yes, I would.

389
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:41,925
In fact, it makes me question
your advocacy for women in general.

390
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,551
Well, that's ridiculous.

391
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,929
What have you done
to further gender equality?

392
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,723
What have you done
to balance the scales?

393
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:52,978
That's your slogan, and yet you've left
half of the population out of the mix.

394
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,521
But that is simply not true.

395
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:56,773
Can, can you name one specific thing?

396
00:25:56,857 --> 00:26:00,194
Yes, I can. Being a woman,
who has served as Solicitor General,

397
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:02,570
one of the few
in the history of the court.

398
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:04,239
Well, that advanced your interests,

399
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:07,534
but what did that do
for 150 million women out there?

400
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:09,577
The very fact that a woman
can hold that position--

401
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:12,914
- So you are a symbol.
- In a way, yes, I suppose I am.

402
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:15,209
Me and many other women,
including yourself--

403
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:19,296
Okay, but how does that get us
from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?

404
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,131
Real cents. Not symbolic cents.

405
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,508
Well, now you're just
aping the president's rhetoric.

406
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,344
Another sexist comment.

407
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:27,428
How could you possibly
misconstrue my words?

408
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:29,806
I speak for myself.

409
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,726
I am not aping the president
or any other man.

410
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:34,311
I'm sorry, I won't engage with this--

411
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:37,231
You know, when things get tough
on the battlefield, we never say,

412
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:42,194
"Sorry, I won't engage."
We engage, Ms. Dunbar.

413
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,782
And you need to confront the fact

414
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:51,203
that you do not have
women's best interests at heart.

415
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:53,288
John, this is getting out of hand.

416
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,707
All right, then let's move on
to the next question.

417
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,959
We are in the foreign policy portion
of this debate.

418
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,296
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question
to you. You're critical of the president.

419
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,924
You say it's indefensible,
what he has done in the Jordan Valley.

420
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:05,967
But specifically,
what would you do differently?

421
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:09,596
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.
Sending troops into the Jordan Valley...

422
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,431
- I need to go back to the hotel.
- ...isn't what I call diplomacy.

423
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:16,311
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood
needs to leave us now.

424
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:20,274
I really wish I could stay,
but I have a very full day tomorrow.

425
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,483
I should rest up.
But again, I want to thank you all

426
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,028
for your hospitality
and all of your hard work.

427
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:27,364
Thank you so much.

428
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,241
Good night, everyone.

429
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,500
His trickle-down diplomacy
is another example of delusion.

430
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:41,502
Mrs. Underwood.

431
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,132
Oh, you should go back inside
with the volunteers

432
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,301
and have the full
campaign experience.

433
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:50,345
I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.
I came to speak with you.

434
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,390
Tomorrow, maybe.
My brain is a bit fried.

435
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,226
Is it what Sharp said?
Why you don't want to watch anymore?

436
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,271
- The sexist comment?
- Oh, I honestly don't care.

437
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:01,106
It's all spectacle.

438
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,150
Who can get the most points, right?

439
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,651
Good night.

440
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,406
Now for part two of our debate:
the domestic agenda.

441
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,741
And the first question goes to you,
Congresswoman.

442
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,576
The President speaks of America Works.

443
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,205
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage.
Talks about regulating executive pay.

444
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,167
But a lot of people aren't quite clear
about your economic policy.

445
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,501
What specifically,
I underscore "specifically,"

446
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,254
would you do if elected president?

447
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:27,841
Well, I plan to do a lot.
And we talked about this earlier.

448
00:28:27,924 --> 00:28:33,638
First and foremost, I want to press for
gender equality and close the salary gap.

449
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,267
If half of the working population
has more money in their pockets,

450
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,937
that will catalyze spending,
which will grow the economy,

451
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,398
which will, in turn, create more jobs.

452
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:45,359
Mr. President,
what do you think of that?

453
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:48,736
Oh, I agree. I think that
gender equality is very important.

454
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,908
And under my AmWorks program, there will
be a provision that all AmWorks jobs,

455
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,995
there can be no discrepancy in pay
between men and women.

456
00:28:57,078 --> 00:29:00,499
AmWorks jobs, that's the government.
What about the rest of the private sector?

457
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:02,834
We have to start by leading by example,
then we introduce--

458
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:05,462
Leading by example? If America Works
is how you lead by example...

459
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,172
I'm sorry, please let me finish my point.

460
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,799
If that is how you lead by example,
then are we to assume

461
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:13,553
that everyone should illegally raid funds
that they have no right to use?

462
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:17,098
Everyone should start robbing banks?
Holding up liquor stores?

463
00:29:17,182 --> 00:29:20,810
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect,
you can criticize my programs

464
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:23,813
as much as you want,
but to accuse me of illegal activity--

465
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,733
One thing you can't deny
is that I am much more of an authority

466
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:29,194
on the Constitution than you are,
Mr. President.

467
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:36,826
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this
stage have taken oaths of office.

468
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,872
I would have to say that we
have all defended the Constitution.

469
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:44,209
You don't have some special claim
on the Constitution.

470
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,586
The Constitution belongs
to everyone in this room

471
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,588
and every citizen in the United States.

472
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:57,722
But I would ask Ms. Sharp, you voted
in favor of dismantling America Works.

473
00:29:57,805 --> 00:30:02,269
Was that because you thought it was
in fact, as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?

474
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:05,897
I voted for dismantlement
because I wanted to make sure

475
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,357
we were prepared for the hurricane,

476
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:11,152
not because I thought your reading
of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.

477
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:14,614
Honestly, you think the president
had a right to do what he did?

478
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,575
It's an appropriations issue,
not a legal one.

479
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:17,867
What about his character?

480
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,994
He basically walked into FEMA and said,

481
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:22,038
"Stick 'em up and show me
where the vault is."

482
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,583
So now I'm a bank robber.
Six Gun Underwood,

483
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:27,710
what they call me in South Carolina.

484
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,799
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.

485
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:36,303
I say you are a hypocrite.

486
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,722
You claim to care about
the ten million people out of work,

487
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,725
but you will steal
their disaster relief fund...

488
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,146
- This is an appropriations issue.
- ...Social Security and health care.

489
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,273
We put 50,000 people to work
in Washington DC.

490
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:52,652
Heather Dunbar wants to balance
the scales to fix a broken system.

491
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:56,406
And yet she sends her own kids
to private school.

492
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,659
With money she never earned,
but which she inherited.

493
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:02,787
Now, it is easy to talk
about the problems of the poor

494
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,415
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

495
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,005
Am I well-off? Absolutely.

496
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:15,091
So was FDR when
he developed the New Deal.

497
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:18,553
Since when does one's income
determine one's amount of empathy?

498
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:20,347
Would you send your kids to public school?

499
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,723
Let's keep our children out of this.

500
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,934
You want your kids to have a head start,

501
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,687
to have an advantage
over the kids in public schools.

502
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,856
Lots of Americans,
of all ranges of income,

503
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:32,817
choose to send their children
to private or parochial schools.

504
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,529
But isn't it true
that you want your children

505
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:37,947
to have a leg up on everyone else?

506
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:41,868
Is that balancing the scales?
Or is that hypocrisy?

507
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:44,787
Or maybe it's that you
didn't want to raise them yourself

508
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,914
so you sent them to boarding school.

509
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,669
Wow.

510
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:52,712
You must really want to be president.

511
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,008
I would never in a million years
bring up your children in a debate.

512
00:31:57,091 --> 00:32:00,053
The way you choose to raise them
is your business.

513
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:03,598
Do I want the best for my kids?
Yes, I do.

514
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,517
I imagine you're the same way.

515
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,143
I hope you are.

516
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:11,481
Well, I'm sure you're
both excellent mothers.

517
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,233
But perhaps we should get back to some--

518
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:16,236
Congresswoman Sharp raised
the issue of sexism earlier.

519
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,280
Now, it is an important point,
and we need to address it.

520
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:22,325
Sexism is wrong.
The Congresswoman is correct

521
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:25,036
in saying that all aspects of it
should be illegal.

522
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,416
And then, she accused me of being sexist
for criticizing Claire Underwood.

523
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:32,001
But wouldn't that same logic
hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?

524
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:35,046
Would you have come after my kids
if I were a man?

525
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:38,132
Aren't you trying to paint the picture
that I'm a bad mother,

526
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:40,635
shipping my kids off
to some far-flung place?

527
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,597
Because you know if you can
make me seem like a bad mother,

528
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,517
then how could anyone
possibly support me?

529
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,312
That's not hardball,
that is just disgusting.

530
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:00,363
Well, I have to say I do think
Ms. Dunbar has a point.

531
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:01,656
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy,

532
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,201
don't you send your own kids
to private school, Congresswoman?

533
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:12,584
- Well, that wasn't my point. I--
- What was your point?

534
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:17,880
Well, I was, um...

535
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:20,508
My... My point....

536
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,099
Um...

537
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,646
John, I think I've said
all I need to say on this subject.

538
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,441
All right, fair enough, Congresswoman.
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.

539
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,821
Okay, guys, first poll is coming in.

540
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:44,699
Most of them give
Frank Underwood the win. Not by a lot.

541
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:48,035
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar,
become the front-runner?

542
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,289
George, I don't think it's so much what
Underwood did, but what he didn't do.

543
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:52,707
He remained presidential.

544
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,794
And when the attacks came his way,
he held the high ground.

545
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:59,506
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out
swinging, and I think it hurt them both.

546
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:02,759
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.
She's 20 points behind the other two.

547
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:05,261
But the sexism thing?
And going after Dunbar's kids?

548
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:08,014
- It seemed quite desperate.
- She did do some damage to Dunbar.

549
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:11,309
I don't know about that.
Dunbar could've fared far worse.

550
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:15,313
She took it on the chin, held her own,
and in my opinion, it was a tie.

551
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:17,898
But bottom line,
does this debate change anything?

552
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,819
Does it affect the caucus, does it
affect the primary in New Hampshire?

553
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,821
We're still over a month out.

554
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:24,614
And so a lot could change
in this process,

555
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,408
but I do think the momentum
could shift in Underwood's favor.

556
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:30,745
Let's not forget that it's remarkable
that a sitting president

557
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,872
isn't considered
the front-runner to begin with.

558
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:36,543
That's an excellent point. No incumbent
has ever had to fight back from this far--

559
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:45,677
- Yes?
- He said she's not picking up, sir.

560
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,804
Would you like me to have him
knock on her door?

561
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,389
No, that's all right. Thank you.

562
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:06,113
You haven't said a word.

563
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,036
Well, you've been prepping for days.

564
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,455
I thought you might want
a break from talking.

565
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,710
You're disappointed in me.

566
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:21,629
That the kids got mentioned.

567
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,383
They're teenagers. They'll be fine.

568
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:29,596
Probably thrilled...
that they got mentioned at all.

569
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:35,852
If I'm disappointed in anyone, it's him,
for throwing you under the bus.

570
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,278
I gotta fly back with you tonight.

571
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,071
Don't you have events tomorrow?

572
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:48,823
This is more important.

573
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,701
What is?

574
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:18,478
Thank you all for coming in.

575
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:20,521
If you want to head
out this door right here.

576
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,107
Thank you very much.

577
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:28,780
All right, I'll give you some privacy.
This should only take 15 minutes.

578
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:31,491
- So just holler out if you need anything.
- Thank you.

579
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,370
Pull up a chair.
We can talk while this finishes up.

580
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:41,626
I should be doing this, too.

581
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:46,339
I'm sure we could
get another lawn chair in here.

582
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:49,049
I can't.
I was a junkie once upon a time.

583
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:55,723
What would you call this color?
Scarlet isn't right.

584
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,391
It's not crimson or maroon.

585
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:59,602
- Carmine.
- Carmine?

586
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:02,146
- You must be a writer.
- Oh...

587
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:05,107
No, I know that.
But you know she always tells everyone

588
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,527
she bakes them herself
and I know she doesn't.

589
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,571
That's local.

590
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:13,073
Thank you for your support.
I'll see you when I get there.

591
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:16,076
Is there some reason
we couldn't do this by phone?

592
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,578
This needed to be in person.

593
00:37:17,662 --> 00:37:19,497
Yes, but you canceled all your events.

594
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,123
I want to talk about the debate.

595
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:24,168
You know, it wasn't the home run
we hoped for, but you did great, Jackie.

596
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:26,462
She spent half the debate
on the defensive.

597
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:29,674
- I humiliated myself.
- You got a little beat up, that's all.

598
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:33,052
- And you threw the biggest punch.
- Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?

599
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:34,470
That wasn't what we discussed.

600
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:36,723
I had to hit you hard so she wouldn't.

601
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,433
And besides,
we had to dispel any suspicion

602
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,810
that you and I might be in concert.

603
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:44,063
I'm not comfortable
with the dynamic we've established.

604
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:48,902
What dynamic is that?

605
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,111
The leash you have me on.

606
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:54,824
How I'm supposed to roll over
and do any trick you want.

607
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:57,076
You're taking me for granted.

608
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:00,329
What, am I supposed to be, uh...

609
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,708
appreciative of your
lackluster enthusiasm?

610
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:09,923
How fortunate I am
to have you "sort of" on my team?

611
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:14,468
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?

612
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:17,471
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.

613
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:19,807
If anything,
you're taking me for granted.

614
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:23,061
- Sir--
- We had a deal, Jackie.

615
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:25,897
And I am perfectly willing
to hold up my end of the bargain.

616
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,107
But do not be under any illusions.

617
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,526
This is not a partnership of equals.

618
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,152
Nothing close to it.

619
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:36,657
If you are to be my vice president,
you will do what I ask.

620
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:39,243
And we will not have this conversation

621
00:38:39,326 --> 00:38:42,914
every time you feel uncomfortable
with what I ask you to do,

622
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:46,042
or how I choose to conduct myself.

623
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:49,378
That's our dynamic.

624
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:59,806
- Are we still sticking to the timeline?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.

625
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:02,141
Are we still sticking to the timeline?
I drop out next week?

626
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:03,643
I see no reason why you shouldn't.

627
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:05,812
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- See you in Iowa.

628
00:39:08,106 --> 00:39:10,357
Why did you change your hair
back to blonde?

629
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,192
That's your burning question?

630
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,903
I'm curious.

631
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:17,323
How does that help the book?

632
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:19,993
Who knows? But right now, I got nothing.

633
00:39:21,368 --> 00:39:24,122
We changed it because blonde polls
better with the voters.

634
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:25,581
We?

635
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,794
There's a whole gaggle of people

636
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:33,339
that weigh in on how you look,
and what you wear,

637
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:38,218
whether an event calls for...
heels, earrings, no earrings.

638
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:41,597
You hate it, don't you?
Campaigning?

639
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,308
Everybody hates campaigning.

640
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:47,020
Except for the politicians.
They feed off the energy.

641
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,647
And their spouses.

642
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,274
You think Francis feeds off me?

643
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:55,111
You are literally giving your blood.

644
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:57,822
Plenty of people give blood
who aren't married to politicians.

645
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:02,702
Very few people campaign
for someone who just fired them.

646
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:07,414
He tell you that?

647
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:11,711
He said he betrayed you. Three days later,
you change your hair back to blonde

648
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:15,089
and resign so you can, quote,
"devote yourself to the campaign."

649
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,051
I did the math.

650
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:22,471
You and Francis, you've....

651
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:25,432
We've what?

652
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,522
He's shared a lot.

653
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:35,193
Does that bother you?

654
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,694
Why would it?

655
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:39,613
Another betrayal?

656
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,615
No.

657
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:43,283
You're...

658
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:51,084
Are you okay?

659
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,793
Just a little light-headed.

660
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:00,426
- Here.
- Thank you.

661
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:14,190
I was thinking.

662
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:15,649
About what?

663
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,154
Mrs. Underwood?

664
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:21,488
Jumping.

665
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,910
- Jumping?
- Mm.

666
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:27,703
You ever have that feeling?

667
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:30,456
- Conversation?
- Which feeling?

668
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,920
On a bridge, you look over and...

669
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,339
step back.

670
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,844
Do you need me to get someone?

671
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:47,389
He proposed and I said...

672
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:50,309
I said seven years.

673
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:57,024
If it's still good, another seven.

674
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,651
If not...

675
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:03,114
Every seven years.

676
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:08,786
I don't hate campaigning.

677
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,414
What I hate is...

678
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:19,713
how much I need us.

679
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:21,799
How much you need each other?

680
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:29,307
I didn't jump.

681
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,100
I didn't step back.

682
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:37,731
I didn't...

683
00:42:37,815 --> 00:42:39,192
Mrs. Underwood?

684
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:44,071
Hey!

685
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:45,739
- What happened?
- She passed out.

686
00:42:45,823 --> 00:42:47,116
Let me see. Mrs. Underwood?

687
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,244
Can you hear me? Mrs. Underwood?

688
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,872
So all these three girls,
they got a different papi or what?

689
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:56,709
They got the blonde, they got
the redhead, they got the brunette.

690
00:42:56,792 --> 00:43:00,171
- And that's Petticoat Junction, right?
- Sir?

691
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:02,756
- May we speak privately?
- Oh, let me let y'all be.

692
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,467
- You're in the middle of your story.
- Sir, if you don't mind.

693
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:07,511
- Is it classified?
- No, it is not.

694
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,555
Then talk.

695
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:12,432
Jackie just stopped by my office.
She's upset.

696
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:15,186
I think we need to take her views
more into consideration.

697
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:18,898
- She's being ridiculous.
- I think she made some valid points.

698
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:24,528
Who do you work for, me or her?

699
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:26,864
I'm just trying to communicate
her concerns.

700
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:29,075
She'd better get in line and so had you.

701
00:43:29,158 --> 00:43:31,202
I'm never gonna win
if I have to spend my time

702
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:32,953
explaining myself to my subordinates.

703
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:35,414
- Look, let me let you--
- No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.

704
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:38,709
Do you remember when we
talked about how you treat your staff?

705
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,213
You want to win? You sure as hell
won't do it without any of them.

706
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,423
You keep on like this,
you won't have any of them left.

707
00:43:44,506 --> 00:43:48,468
Are you talking about loyalty? The only
brand of that I accept is unconditional.

708
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:52,014
- Anything less is a--
- Y'all should put this on pay-per-view.

709
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:55,226
But you. You a big guy.
But this sucker,

710
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:59,146
I've seen him go through
a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.

711
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,108
- Who'd you put your money on?
- Oh, I'm not gonna fall into that trap.

712
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,610
- You.
- Sir? It's your wife.

713
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:06,570
- She passed out giving blood.
- What?

714
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,572
She's okay,
but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.

715
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,991
I'll take it in my private study.

716
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,623
Don't do no good
callin' a man out like that.

717
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:22,253
It's like...
blamin' a snake for having fangs.

718
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:24,797
- I couldn't help myself.
- Mmm...

719
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,007
- Could you do me a favor?
- What's that?

720
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:30,469
Cover for me.
I got work to do and he needs company.

721
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:33,097
Back at the ribs joint,
I could just walk back in the kitchen

722
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,266
when I got tired of hearing him talk.

723
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:38,394
- Yeah. I'll tell him your boss came over.
- Thank you, brother.

724
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,370
Put her on the phone with me.

725
00:44:56,454 --> 00:44:58,664
She didn't want me to call,
but I thought I should.

726
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:01,417
- Well, is she nearby?
- I think she's embarrassed.

727
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,252
I'm her husband.

728
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:06,839
The nurses are with her. Maybe you should
just hold off for a few minutes.

729
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:09,591
Tell the head of her detail
to get her on the plane right away.

730
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:12,386
She has to come back here
and see the White House physician.

731
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,848
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed
if she had to cancel her events.

732
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,809
This isn't about how she feels.
This is about what's best for her.

733
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:22,396
She doesn't need a doctor.
She needs you.

734
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,148
What do you mean?

735
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:27,318
She said some things,
about every seven years.

736
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:30,988
About being in limbo,
on the edge of a bridge.

737
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:34,741
Listen, just because I may have shared
with you a few things about our marriage

738
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:37,161
does not give you the right
to interfere with it.

739
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:39,663
Now, please have her
call me when she's ready.

740
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:48,005
Well... this is it.

741
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:51,133
- Sixty days.
- Sixty days.

742
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,136
That movie freaked me out.

743
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:57,931
The whole world can fall apart
in sixty days.

744
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,018
Or a guy can get sober.

745
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:04,604
I washed my hands for ten minutes
last night before bed.

746
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:06,857
You turned me
from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.

747
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:10,319
That's not a bad trade-off.

748
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:12,821
The 14 years I got by on my own...

749
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:17,117
They mean nothing compared to the last
eight weeks you've been here with me.

750
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:18,827
Well...

751
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:21,121
You would have done the same for me.

752
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:23,374
I'd like to think so.

753
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:26,668
Know so.

754
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,839
I love you, brother.

755
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:53,904
Call me when you land.

756
00:46:53,987 --> 00:46:56,156
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.

757
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:12,214
So we want to focus on ad-buys

758
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:15,050
more in the Quad Cities market,
less so in Des Moines.

759
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:18,887
You're stronger in the East and we want
to turn our twos there into ones.

760
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:23,016
The "vision" message really resonated
in our focus groups post-debate,

761
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,769
so I think we should cut
a new ad centered on that

762
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:27,896
and weave it into the stump.

763
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,359
Sir?

764
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,403
I'm sorry, what?

765
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:37,281
Are you good if we change the stump
to focus on the "vision" theme?

766
00:47:37,364 --> 00:47:39,617
I want to go to New Hampshire tomorrow,
first thing.

767
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:41,076
We have you going to Iowa.

768
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,828
I know, but I want
to change the schedule.

769
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,915
In every campaign,
there comes a time for taking stock.

770
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,335
A time for soul-searching. And...

771
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:53,547
in the past 24 hours,
I have done just that.

772
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:57,217
And the conclusion
that I have come to is this:

773
00:47:57,301 --> 00:48:01,763
If the goal is a safer,
more prosperous America,

774
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:04,308
I don't need to run
for us to achieve that.

775
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:09,188
All I need to do and what I encourage
all of my supporters to do

776
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:13,233
is to help elect Heather Dunbar
to the White House.

777
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,488
- Judas bitch.
- While I may be ending my camp--

778
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:26,372
I'm just pissed off.
I'm sorry if I offended.

779
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,917
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.

780
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:32,670
Nothing.

781
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:34,672
Yeah, right.

782
00:48:34,754 --> 00:48:36,590
I know for a fact.

783
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:39,593
You knew about this?

784
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:50,145
You should call the president.

785
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:11,749
"A very hairy, terribly scary
tarantula named Tina.

786
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,336
I found her in a shoebox
in New York City.

787
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,214
When I first saw Tina I shrieked..."

788
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:18,716
Eek! Eek! Eek!

789
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:20,008
Were you scared?

790
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:22,261
Oh, I was terribly scared.

791
00:49:23,512 --> 00:49:25,723
"Tina had poked her head up
out of the left shoe..."

792
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:29,142
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Shh... She doesn't either.

793
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:32,229
"So there I was,
not knowing what to believe.

794
00:49:32,312 --> 00:49:36,275
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox
or set Tina free?"

795
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:38,527
- Leave her in the box!
- Set her free!

796
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:40,195
- Set her free!
- Leave her in the box!

797
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:41,988
Oh, my goodness!
I don't know what to do!

798
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:43,490
Nothing! Do nothing!

799
00:49:43,574 --> 00:49:45,951
Sir, Mr. Grayson
needs to speak with you.

800
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,203
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- He says it's important.

801
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,498
Later. I'm with my wife.

802
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:54,000
I don't know what to do!

803
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:56,002
You shouldn't do anything.

804
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:58,631
- Let her out!
- Don't do anything?
