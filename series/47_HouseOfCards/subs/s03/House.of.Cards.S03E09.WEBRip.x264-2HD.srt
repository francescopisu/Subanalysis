1
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,863
Well, the president just saw me come.

2
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,739
Oh...

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,995
- You don't like my giraffe?
- No.

4
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,584
You know I'm divorced twice
and have a daughter in college, right?

5
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,506
- It's on your Wikipedia page.
- Wikipedia.

6
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,216
Christ.

7
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,177
I don't have any expectations.

8
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,680
I never have, of anyone.

9
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,225
You shouldn't either.

10
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,313
How many events have we skipped today?

11
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,566
Mm...

12
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,653
Three so far.

13
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,156
And we're about to skip a fourth.

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,743
- All on the Telegraph's dime.
- Hey, I'm a free agent.

15
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,038
Means I'm free to bail on a speech
I've already seen ten thousand times.

16
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,041
You are entitled...

17
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,003
- to nothing.
- Stop.

18
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,839
Let me be clear.
I say, I say...

19
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,633
Come here, boy.

20
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,052
You are entitled...

21
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,554
To nothing!

22
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,890
Now, here's the truth:
The American dream is broken.

23
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,810
And when we are robbed of our dreams,

24
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,396
well, let me ask you, folks,
what are we left with?

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,647
Nothing!

26
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,025
And when I asked Congress
to help me take this country

27
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:35,531
from a welfare state to a fully-employed
nation, what did Congress do?

28
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:36,740
Nothing!

29
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,785
And when we proved that
America Works actually works,

30
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,165
when we created 50,000 jobs
in Washington DC,

31
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,917
Congress didn't just stop at nothing,

32
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,254
they killed progress in its tracks.

33
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,636
Believe me, I know how you feel.

34
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,596
But we have to remember why we're here.

35
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,974
We have to turn that anger into action.

36
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,602
Ma'am, the Secretary General...

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,855
America Works will succeed,
but we need your help.

38
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,148
Hello?

39
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,277
You need to let them know
that a vote for Frank Underwood

40
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,863
is a vote for America Works!

41
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:23,204
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works!

42
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:29,043
Now, I had the great pleasure of meeting
a woman this morning named Gloria.

43
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,505
She has a degree
from Iowa State University

44
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,133
and even with her degree,
she can't get employed.

45
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,261
Now, why?
Why is that the case?

46
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,640
Becau-- My wife, ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,110
I think what my wife is gently trying
to tell me is that I've run overtime.

48
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:59,699
She has a very clever nickname for me.

49
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,075
- "Verbosity."
- Yeah.

50
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,413
Now, the main difference
between Claire and me,

51
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,998
aside from her stunning beauty,
of course,

52
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,876
is that she actually knows
what that word means.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,798
Now, look, I would love to stay here all
afternoon and answer all your questions,

54
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,135
but then I'd leave all your friends
in Cedar Rapids waiting for me

55
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,013
even longer than they have
and we don't want to do that.

56
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,517
So I want to thank you all
for coming out to see me today,

57
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,228
to hear about this battle,
this fight we're in.

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,355
I want you to caucus for me,

59
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,317
and let's help get Gloria a job!

60
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,738
America Works only if you make it work!

61
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,866
God bless Iowa!
God bless the United States of America!

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,787
- Thank you!
- Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

63
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,874
An IED right off Route 90,
three kilometers from the Jordan River.

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,543
- When?
- Thirty-six minutes ago.

65
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,129
Russian unit was on patrol.
Two armored vehicles were destroyed.

66
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,298
- All eight troops were killed.
- Who's Cathy spoken to?

67
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,049
Foreign Minister
hasn't returned her call.

68
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,510
We have to make sure the Secretary
General doesn't say anything

69
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:04,472
until we have a better handle. Remy,
I need to speak to Petrov immediately.

70
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,974
I contacted the Kremlin.
They said he'll reach out soon.

71
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,768
We need the UN
to investigate the blast site.

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,395
The Russians have cordoned it off.
They're not letting anyone in.

73
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,896
- Why not?
- We don't know.

74
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,274
We had a unit nearby that
heard the blast, went in to help.

75
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,568
- Russians turned them away.
- I don't like the feel of this.

76
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,737
Cathy says the Israelis want
to send in their own team.

77
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,406
We can't let that happen. The second
Israeli boots hit the ground--

78
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,033
Remy, I don't care what you have to do,
you get Petrov on the phone.

79
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,619
We need to head this off at the pass.

80
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,163
And make sure no one in Congress
overreacts either.

81
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:56,799
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

82
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,180
How was the game?

83
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,266
Great, until my phone
started blowing up.

84
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,227
Let me see what you have so far.

85
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,815
Um... no.

86
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,485
This is no good.
The language is too obtuse.

87
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,781
- Simpler. More direct.
- Look, here's the deal:

88
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,950
If the Russians don't play ball,
the Israelis will get nervous.

89
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,620
If the Israelis send troops in,
the Palestinians will go apeshit.

90
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,122
If the Palestinians go apeshit,
there could be mortar attacks.

91
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,208
And if there are mortar attacks,
the whole peacekeeping mission

92
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,669
- could go down the drain.
- You want me to actually say that?

93
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,297
God, no.
We need to say the opposite.

94
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,301
Look, make it as clear as the doomsday
scenario that I just described,

95
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,512
but then flip it around
and put a happy face on it.

96
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,182
We can reschedule
everything else,

97
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,394
- but I'm concerned about Harlan Traub.
- The IDP Chairman.

98
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,814
And President
of the Food Processors Association.

99
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,483
He's big for us statewide. We were
supposed to meet with him tonight.

100
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,401
Well, this is a national
security emergency.

101
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,861
He hasn't met with Dunbar yet.

102
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,571
If we cancel,
she gets a clean shot at him.

103
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,907
- All right, so put him on the plane.
- FEC rules.

104
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,034
Campaigning on Air Force One
costs 179,000 an hour.

105
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,245
- Aside from the message it sends--
- So I won't campaign.

106
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,748
I won't have time anyway.
Uh, just make him feel special.

107
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,667
Give him some face time in Washington.

108
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,751
Anything?

109
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,086
Moryakov's office
is giving me the runaround.

110
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,464
An IED
has killed eight Russian troops

111
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,924
on patrol in the Jordan Valley.

112
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,844
So far, no one has claimed
responsibility for this attack.

113
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,805
The only reaction from the Kremlin,
a brief written statement

114
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,516
from Foreign Minister Bugayev
that reads, quote,

115
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,478
"The perpetrators will be found
and brought to justice." End quote.

116
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,564
- Wheels up in 20 minutes.
- I gotta grab my bags from my room.

117
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,150
- Okay. Meet me out front.
- We should take separate cars.

118
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,277
A cab won't even get here
before the plane takes off.

119
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,321
You're coming with me.

120
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,739
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,658
Not a good day to play hooky.

122
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,536
It's gonna be a late night here.

123
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,080
It depends what Petrov does.
So far, just incredibly loud silence.

124
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,584
I gotta go, hon. Foreign Affairs
is holding an emergency session.

125
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,795
I love you, too.

126
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,507
- I don't have much time.
- Neither do I.

127
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,010
Talking points.

128
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,100
These make me uncomfortable.

129
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,812
Even in a closed session,
whatever I say will get out.

130
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,147
- I'll take hits in Iowa.
- You can't criticize the mission.

131
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,566
We need you to keep everyone calm.

132
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,068
You know how I feel about
unnecessary military involvement.

133
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,821
You asked to be on the ticket, Jackie.
It's been non-stop resistance.

134
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,573
If you don't want
to support the president,

135
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,409
you shouldn't want to be his number two.
I'm sick of pulling teeth.

136
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,414
You're right. I'll do what I can.

137
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,499
Jackie...

138
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,214
I didn't mean to snap.

139
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,762
I know it's hard having a presence here
and campaigning at the same time.

140
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,806
I'm sure it's tough on Alan
and the kids, too.

141
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,934
Alan's been a big help, actually.

142
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,607
I'm glad he's stepping up,
giving you the support you need.

143
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,610
I thought I would hate it,
the whole marriage thing.

144
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,278
But it's nice.

145
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:16,157
When I can get home,
everyone around the table.

146
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,037
I even cook sometimes.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,123
- Badly, but they indulge me.
- No.

148
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,834
- I have my June Cleaver moments.
- Apron and all?

149
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,294
Don't push it.

150
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,010
I can't remember the last time
I had a home-cooked meal.

151
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,516
- Session's about to start.
- Yeah.

152
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,310
I'll fill you in after.

153
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,778
Tom.

154
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,159
- Where have you been all day?
- Sorry. Working on the book.

155
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,411
I know we were supposed to have
an opportunity to speak,

156
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,580
- but obviously now, it's--
- Of course.

157
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,707
Listen, you can come up
and sit up front if you like.

158
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,836
- I spoke to Claire about it.
- I'm fine back here. Thanks.

159
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,295
Okay.

160
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:34,235
I need to know this passport lock
is being lifted.

161
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,490
- Show me what you got.
- I'm tired of being strung along.

162
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:43,495
- You have a location?
- Yeah. But I want a timeline.

163
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,330
- Week or two.
- No.

164
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,124
They've stopped giving me
new assignments.

165
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,917
That means they're getting ready
to fuck me.

166
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,669
It has to happen sooner than that.

167
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,590
What are you doing?

168
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,720
E-mailing a friend in Homeland.

169
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,763
He always gets back to me quickly.

170
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,852
You satisfied?

171
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,542
Rachel.

172
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,337
- It says Jane Doe.
- No, it's her.

173
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,298
It's her.

174
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,260
She ghosted the identity of a girl
named Rebecca Sands.

175
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,638
The birthday's pretty close.

176
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,517
It's August 1990, then she died
in '93, along with her whole family.

177
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,853
But her social went active
about six months ago.

178
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,732
But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands.
It says Jane Doe.

179
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,151
State troopers
found her body in a ditch,

180
00:12:56,235 --> 00:13:00,155
in an abandoned construction site
outside of Tucson.

181
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,159
I mean, there's no--
There's no picture.

182
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,995
There's no proof of anything.

183
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,848
"And do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God

184
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,810
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

185
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,855
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger

186
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,193
and clamor and evil speaking
be put away from you."

187
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,833
No.

188
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:59,256
- No, no. That's not her.
- Come on, man. There's fingerprints.

189
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,842
Fingerprints from the Tale of Two Cities
book that you gave me.

190
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,052
I ran it against the autopsy report.

191
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,724
It was a ten-point match with Jane Doe.

192
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,484
I need the passport lock lifted now.

193
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,156
- Uh!
- Oh!

194
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,283
- I'm on it.
- When will you be on it?

195
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,742
- Soon.
- Soon? How soon?

196
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,619
As soon as I can!

197
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,544
I did my part.
Get the lock lifted.

198
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,488
You've reached Seth Grayson.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

199
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,910
I need to see him.

200
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,870
My mother died.

201
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,019
Come on!

202
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,230
Hey!

203
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,691
Are you okay?

204
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,444
Hey, man. What the fuck?

205
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,740
Sorry.

206
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,576
You believe this guy?
You want to say it to her, shithead?

207
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,494
Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,914
- Drinks on me.
- We don't want drinks, shithead.

209
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,499
You need to get out of here.
Tommy, this guy's trashed.

210
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,836
Here. Drinks on me.

211
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,298
No, no. We don't want drinks.
We want you to leave.

212
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,216
Come on. Just take it.
I said I was sorry.

213
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,051
- I don't give a shit.
- Take it.

214
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,179
No, he's apologizing.
I'm telling you.

215
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,306
Sorry.

216
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,225
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- I will bust your fucking face!

217
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,394
- Calm down. Let me get you a cab.
- Okay.

218
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:25,819
Hello, everyone.
I'm afraid I don't have much news.

219
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,489
We are in touch, uh, with the Russians,
but there's very few details.

220
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm waiting to speak
with President Petrov.

221
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,577
- Any reason for the delay?
- He just lost eight soldiers.

222
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,247
Talking to their families
is his priority as it would be mine.

223
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,791
Think this could jeopardize
the peacekeeping mission?

224
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,918
Well, every country
that contributed troops

225
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,504
knew that something
like this was a possibility.

226
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,799
But the Russians fought this plan hard.
This gives Petrov the perfect out.

227
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,802
I wouldn't presume to know
what President Petrov is thinking.

228
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,054
I'll know more once we have
a chance to speak.

229
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,890
What about Congress?
They weren't fans of this mission.

230
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,852
I'm gonna consult with Congressional
leadership as soon as we get back.

231
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,938
In the meantime, my focus is to help
the Russians in any way that I can.

232
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,565
How can you help them when they won't
let anyone near the blast site?

233
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,151
Well, that hasn't been confirmed.

234
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,821
Unless, of course, you have better
intelligence than the Pentagon.

235
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,325
Thank you all very much.
More soon.

236
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,300
Israel wants to go public,
blame Palestine for the attack.

237
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,592
There's no evidence yet.

238
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,555
Yes, well, the message is that Palestine
should be keeping its people in check.

239
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,765
They've also moved 500 troops
to a staging area

240
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:42,270
- across the border from Beit She'an.
- Christ. Try the Kremlin again, please.

241
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,069
You try yawning?

242
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,821
That works for you, not for me.

243
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,781
What about some water?
Sometimes that helps.

244
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,285
I don't need water, I need a phone call.

245
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,580
Maybe you should talk to Traub
while you're waiting for that phone call.

246
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,547
- You're not eating?
- I'm not hungry.

247
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,382
I think you don't like to fly.

248
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,800
Holding onto that table
like it's a stripper's tits.

249
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,136
Harlan. I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

250
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,180
Please, don't get up.
How's your lobster?

251
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,973
It tastes like it was caught
this morning.

252
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,769
Well, it was.
Nothing but the best for Air Force One.

253
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,854
Sir, I know you have a million things
on your mind,

254
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,190
but I would just love to talk to you
about how to modernize

255
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,401
the food-processing industry in Iowa.

256
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,946
Please, slit my wrists
with his butter knife.

257
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,865
We can't talk election on the plane,
Harlan. That's an FEC no-no.

258
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,534
This isn't about the campaign.

259
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,120
We're talking about the economy,
not the caucus. Right, Harlan?

260
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,746
That's right.

261
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,124
I'm sure you're aware, sir,
that we lead the states

262
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,251
in corn and soybean production.

263
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,669
It's a good thing,
given the trend towards vegan.

264
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,171
But our food-processing plants--

265
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,924
- Well, the largest industry in Iowa.
- That's correct.

266
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,884
And they're slow on the uptake, sir.

267
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,011
We need federal funding
to help subsidize

268
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,181
- the transition toward healthier--
- Mr. President. Your call from Russia.

269
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,724
Oh. I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

270
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,603
But Harlan, we'll get into it,
I promise.

271
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,022
Viktor, it's a terrible tragedy,
Mr. President.

272
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,524
I feel for your loss.

273
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,319
This is why your people
were so persistent?

274
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,029
So you could offer your sympathy? Hm?

275
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,574
It's important that we talk.

276
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,951
You're not letting anyone
near the blast site.

277
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,203
We're conducting our investigation.

278
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,165
Well, is there anything wrong
with allowing UN investigators

279
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,000
to work in conjunction with your people?

280
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,710
UN Command sent my men on that patrol,

281
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,672
the most dangerous stretch
of Route 90 in the entire valley.

282
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,176
- And you sent my men.
- Me? What are you talking about?

283
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,428
You saw my men as expendable.

284
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,599
Viktor, I don't personally oversee
the peacekeeping forces,

285
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,685
and you can't possibly think that
there was some deliberate attempt

286
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,688
- to put your men in harm's way.
- So I am to believe, what?

287
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,192
That this was a random
act of fate, yes?

288
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:56,655
Listen, whoever's responsible, we can't
let them foment distrust between us.

289
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,698
If we do, then they win.

290
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,160
Let's show them that an incident
like this makes us stronger.

291
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,287
Let us help you find out who did this.

292
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,956
Russians are dead.
Russia will find the killers.

293
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,459
I don't understand
why you're refusing our assistance.

294
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,085
Because we don't need it.

295
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,713
Well, can we at least
keep the dialogue open?

296
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,508
Consult with each other
before you make any move?

297
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,387
I'm going to do what I must,
Mr. President.

298
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,806
Viktor, please listen to me.
We have--

299
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,143
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the line has been disconnected.

300
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,523
He hung up on me.

301
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,864
Cathy Durant, please.

302
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,243
Baldwin was right.

303
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,995
Those eight bodies give Petrov options.

304
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,499
He's not shedding tears,
he's popping champagne corks.

305
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,459
I can hear them.

306
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,350
Not here. Sir.
Restroom's this way.

307
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,480
Who was that?
The guy who just came in?

308
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,357
Didn't see him.

309
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,539
I would've come to your office.

310
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,375
This is the only room
at the UN we don't monitor.

311
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,170
- I'm assuming you don't either.
- No, we haven't bugged it.

312
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:46,133
- So we can speak openly.
- I think we should.

313
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,930
You talk. I'll listen.

314
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,897
Palestine says it can't control Hamas
if Israeli troops cross into the valley.

315
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,778
We have to back channel this, Alexi.
Petrov won't listen to Francis.

316
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,995
Alexi, please. This whole thing,
you can't let it devolve

317
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,248
into something nobody can control.

318
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,126
Well, maybe that was the objective.

319
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,296
What was?

320
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,885
The president...
never wanted the peacekeeping mission.

321
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,346
You said "objective." Are you telling me
this was somehow planned?

322
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,975
- I haven't said anything.
- But you want to.

323
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,271
The whole world wants to know
who is responsible.

324
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,232
Your troops won't let anyone
near the blast site.

325
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,491
Because they don't want
the world to know.

326
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,327
My brother... he's in the FSB.

327
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,205
We spoke a week ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

328
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,417
Are you absolutely certain about this?

329
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,173
Alexi, go public.

330
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,469
We'll protect you.

331
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,095
Like you did Xander Feng?

332
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,808
That was different.

333
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,477
I have a family.

334
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,524
The FSB has conducted
these sorts of operations before.

335
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,400
The apartment complex that blew up,

336
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,278
Petrov used that
to justify invading Chechnya.

337
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,447
The opera house that was gassed,

338
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,825
he removed all provincial
governors after that.

339
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,536
We do believe the FSB
participated in the first.

340
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,872
We're still uncertain
about the opera house.

341
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:43,209
But blowing up his own soldiers,
I find that very difficult to believe.

342
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,087
Did he tell you point blank?
Did he say the words?

343
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,466
He said as much as he could.

344
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,177
But the implication was crystal clear.

345
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,053
I'm sure he was very convincing.

346
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,016
All Russian diplomats go through
FSB counter-intel training.

347
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,894
They're trying to provoke
some sort of reaction out of us.

348
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,395
But what about his brother?

349
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,772
It is true that his brother
works for the FSB,

350
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,733
and that we lost track
of him last week.

351
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,694
- That part of the story holds up.
- What's our profile on Moryakov?

352
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,530
We have our agent who's been
assigned to him, sir. Jim?

353
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:16,116
Moryakov has been considered
a bit of a wild card in Moscow.

354
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,076
Petrov considered recalling him twice,

355
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,914
but held off because
his father's a family friend.

356
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,290
Now, we picked up some chatter
in recent months,

357
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:27,420
his misgivings with how the Kremlin's
been handling the Jordan Valley.

358
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,964
But does he strike you as a traitor?

359
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,842
He's a complicated man.
Fiercely nationalistic.

360
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,636
But he definitely
has doubts about Petrov.

361
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,100
Shouldn't we at least
entertain the possibility?

362
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,145
Yeah, but how can we determine it
one way or the other? Definitively?

363
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,981
Our satellites aren't enough.

364
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:51,235
We'd have to get men to the blast site,
retrieve soil samples and blast debris.

365
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,781
How soon could we get a team in?

366
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,490
I'd estimate 72 hours.

367
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,826
Well, three days seems
an awfully long time.

368
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,370
Don't we already have the basics
in place for deployment?

369
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,706
That doesn't take into account
the Russian forces.

370
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,499
We'd want better intel before deploying.

371
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,381
Am I correct in assuming
that every hour that passes,

372
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,094
our chances of retrieving
any proof diminish?

373
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,637
That is correct, sir.

374
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,180
What's the absolute soonest
you can deploy?

375
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:25,227
Twelve hours, Mr. President. But that
would involve an extremely high degree--

376
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,146
Yeah, I'm aware of the risk, Admiral.

377
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,899
What are the odds of success?

378
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,445
Honestly, sir,
without proper intelligence,

379
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,405
I can't say better than 50/50.

380
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,952
You're certain?

381
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,412
Yes, I am.

382
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,960
Let's put it in motion.

383
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,464
- Mr. President?
- Mark.

384
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,676
Shouldn't the UN be conducting the
investigation instead of the Russians?

385
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,013
The Russians have been our partners in
this mission from day one of deployment,

386
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,016
so I would say that they're conducting
their own investigation

387
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,978
on behalf of the United Nations,
not instead of.

388
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,980
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

389
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,108
Is it correct to say that they are
in no way reporting to UN Command?

390
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,819
In peacekeeping missions,
nations volunteer their forces.

391
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,155
They answer to their own
governments first and foremost,

392
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,616
then they cooperate with the UN Command.
That's an important distinction to make.

393
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,369
Now, any other questions
with respect to the Jordan Valley

394
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,163
should be directed
to the State Department.

395
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,041
But if any of you have questions
that don't relate to yesterday's events,

396
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,250
I'll take one or two.
Yeah, Stephanie.

397
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,712
Mr. President,
Kate and I both had a question.

398
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,005
Thank you, Stephanie.

399
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,841
Mr. President, are you aware, sir,
that campaigning on Air Force One

400
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,760
- is a violation of FEC rules?
- Yes, in general, I am.

401
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,972
Harlan Traub was on the plane yesterday.
It's hard to imagine he was there

402
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,516
for any other reason than you'd be
seeking his support in Iowa.

403
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,602
You don't know how long I've known him,
and yes, he was on the plane yesterday.

404
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,605
But it's not a violation
if you don't campaign, which I didn't.

405
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:55,026
I think the extent of our conversation
was asking him how he liked his meal.

406
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,277
But I'm happy to let the FEC decide.

407
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,573
Now, does anybody else have any question
that somebody else asked them to ask me?

408
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:02,992
Where's Traub now?

409
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,036
At the Hay-Adams.
Should be here in an hour.

410
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,163
It'd be bad if anyone saw him
at the White House.

411
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,873
Well, I don't even
want him in DC now.

412
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,209
The last thing we need
is some bullshit FEC story

413
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,960
while I'm trying to deal
with the Russians.

414
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,837
Let's get him back to Iowa.
And you handle this.

415
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,839
You have better people skills
than Vaughn.

416
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:20,467
And you talk to Baldwin. You make it
crystal clear we violated no regulations.

417
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,804
Sir? I got a voicemail
from Doug last night.

418
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:27,183
- He said his mom died.
- My God, that's awful.

419
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,603
Except Julia Stamper
passed away ten years ago.

420
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,396
I know, I was at the funeral.

421
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,149
Send some flowers.
Actually, get Doug in here.

422
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,484
I'd like to give my condolences
in person.

423
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:43,116
There's a whole host of ways we can
revolutionize food processing in Iowa

424
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,451
through America Works.
The subsidies you want for R and D

425
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,037
- can be financed as a jobs--
- You don't have to do this.

426
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,705
- Do what?
- Sweet talk me.

427
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,208
And a cab would've been fine.

428
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,587
I wanted to drive you myself so we had
a chance to talk about your concerns.

429
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,174
Well, I'm used to talking to candidates,
not chauffeurs.

430
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,388
- I'm not a chauffeur.
- Hm?

431
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,641
Well, it's your hands on the wheel.

432
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,967
Seth?

433
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,875
- Shit.
- Registration and insurance, please.

434
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,460
I'm sorry, officer.
I left my wallet at work.

435
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,379
Registration? Proof of insurance?

436
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,049
- In my wallet.
- You're supposed to keep it in the car.

437
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,177
Yeah. But if someone steals
your car, why give 'em the paperwork?

438
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,471
All right, I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for a moment, please.

439
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,684
Officer, my name is Remy Danton.
I'm Chief of Staff to the president.

440
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,812
Without your identification, sir,
I don't know who you are.

441
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,481
- Got my government pin.
- That doesn't matter, sir.

442
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,526
I still need to see your identification.
Would you step out of the car, please?

443
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,404
Officer, you run a search on Remy Danton,
you'll get my photo.

444
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,324
Sir, I asked you to step out of the car.
Please.

445
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,749
- Any weapons on you?
- Of course not.

446
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,585
All right. You mind stepping
to the rear of the vehicle, please?

447
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm gonna pat you down,
just to make sure.

448
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,677
Feet back.

449
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,348
Car comes back to a Virginia
corporation, no address.

450
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,017
I'm cleared Top Secret,
my information is masked.

451
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,436
Sir, I need you to stay here
for a moment, please.

452
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,941
- What do you got?
- No address on file.

453
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,943
- Why'd you stop me?
- One moment, sir.

454
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,612
No, not one moment. I got the right
to know why you stopped me.

455
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,530
Sir, I asked you to keep
your hands on the car.

456
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,617
I'm gonna need your badge number. Trying
to show off for your partner, brother?

457
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm not your brother.
Don't make us restrain you.

458
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,204
- Officer Davis.
- Sir.

459
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,622
Officer Corchoran.

460
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,832
Know what? I'm gonna take a photo.

461
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,210
What the fuck?!

462
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,089
- What's your problem?!
- Calm down!

463
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,258
Sir!

464
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,759
I'm gonna need your badge number!

465
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,853
Mr. Danton, I'm Lieutenant Hixson.

466
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,398
I'm very sorry
for this misunderstanding.

467
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,941
Watch your head.

468
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,821
I hope you accept my apology
on their behalf.

469
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,532
- They said I was stopped for speeding.
- Yes.

470
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,161
When they encounter someone
without a license and registration--

471
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,495
Write up the ticket.

472
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,831
You don't have to worry about that, sir.
You're free to go.

473
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,791
If I was speeding,
give me the damn ticket.

474
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,086
That's really not necessary
after everything we put you through.

475
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,712
Lieutenant.

476
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,807
Hey. I'd invite you up,
but the kids, they're--

477
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,311
We're bringing them to Iowa
this trip and it's a total shit-show.

478
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,022
I didn't come here to talk to you
about the campaign.

479
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:46,733
I probably... you know, I shouldn't
have just shown up like this, but...

480
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,861
Here. Come this way.

481
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,866
It's stupid.
I don't even know why I came over.

482
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,909
Did something happen?

483
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:59,455
I got pulled over. For speeding.

484
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,292
Things got out of hand.
A nigger in a nice car.

485
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,752
Jesus.

486
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,214
I left my wallet at work.

487
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,384
When I tried to tell the guy who I was,
he didn't believe me, so...

488
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,636
I don't know.

489
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,389
I didn't believe me.

490
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,767
There I was with my hands
in cuffs and it was like, uh...

491
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,273
It was like I was outside of myself.

492
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,402
I could've been anyone.

493
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,819
I wasn't me.

494
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,784
- Does that make any sense?
- You got rattled.

495
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,538
No, it's not that.

496
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,874
I look at you and Alan,
and even Frank and Claire.

497
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,336
This happened and I didn't have
anyone to tell about it.

498
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,672
You have me, right?

499
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,509
I'm glad you came over.

500
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,223
It's not fair.
Intruding on you like this.

501
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,268
If I thought you were intruding,
I wouldn't have come downstairs.

502
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,702
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

503
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,787
I--

504
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,706
You still mean a lot to me.

505
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,293
I am there for you, as your friend.

506
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,047
You should go back up. Finish packing.

507
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,758
Safe flight.

508
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:42,015
We're set to insert at 2100 EST,
0400 local time.

509
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,560
We'll use a Fulton recovery
of any material samples.

510
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,852
The extraction?

511
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,731
The team will make its way on foot
to this rendezvous point for extract.

512
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,442
How are they gonna pass
the Russian lines?

513
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:54,069
Our intel is spotty at best,
but our team is scheduled

514
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,281
to link up with a local agent
who will assist.

515
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,409
Let's move this down to the Situation
Room. I'll be there in a few minutes.

516
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,077
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,291
Did he say anything?

518
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,793
He wouldn't even look at me
when I said hello.

519
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,211
Send him in.

520
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,844
Doug.

521
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,505
Are you certain?

522
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,932
Who gathered all this inform--
Oh, never mind. I shouldn't know.

523
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,645
Was it you... who...?

524
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,022
No.

525
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,279
You shouldn't have brought this here.

526
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,197
I wanted you to see it.

527
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,451
So you would believe me.

528
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,579
Brutal.

529
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,125
I'm drunk, sir.

530
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,213
I'm-- I'm drunk right now.

531
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,139
This girl really meant something to you,
didn't she?

532
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,515
Yeah.

533
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,810
She did.

534
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,691
I've been working for Dunbar.

535
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,284
I pushed myself too much.
It's my fault.

536
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,373
It was for you.
To see how close I could get.

537
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,418
If I could find something,
a silver bullet.

538
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,048
To prove that...
I was still useful.

539
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,767
How can I help you, Doug?

540
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,269
I can't go to rehab.

541
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,689
- Just not another hospital, or...
- Okay.

542
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,525
I just... I can't... I can't do it.

543
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,569
We'll figure something out.

544
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:26,948
I'm not Peter Russo.

545
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,910
I won't go like he did.

546
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,755
No, you won't.
You're going to get better, Doug.

547
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,634
I promise you that.

548
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,602
Yes, send Meechum in here.

549
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,416
There's an envelope on my desk.
I need it to be incinerated.

550
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,876
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,049
And then I need you to take Doug home.

552
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,346
Come on, Doug, it's time to go.

553
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,027
This way, Mr. Stamper.

554
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,324
You stay with him
until we figure out what's next.

555
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,743
Yes, sir.

556
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,755
Some privacy, please.

557
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,593
- This is Heather Dunbar.
- I'll connect you momentarily.

558
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,763
Heather?

559
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,139
Mr. President?

560
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,517
Doug Stamper is my friend,
and you came very close to killing him.

561
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,353
- Excuse me?
- You're aware he's an alcoholic?

562
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,940
- Yes.
- And how serious his injuries were.

563
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,610
- Mr. President--
- But you still put him to work.

564
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:30,614
A man who's trying to recover,
who's trying to get back his life.

565
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,950
Did you honestly think
that he could handle that?

566
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,326
Douglas came to us.

567
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:39,331
And you should've turned him away
if you had one ounce of decency.

568
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,459
What's happened?
Is he okay?

569
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,337
You don't have the right
to ask me that question.

570
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,965
And if you do anything
that endangers his health again,

571
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:54,137
I swear to God,
I will put you in your fucking grave.

572
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,320
Let's continue.

573
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,992
Thirty-two thousand feet,
one minute to insert.

574
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,202
Let's hear comms.

575
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,954
Audio on.

576
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,998
Stand up!

577
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,709
Twenty seconds. Last checks.

578
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,420
Last checks! Gather round.

579
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:40,017
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven,

580
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,561
six, five, four,

581
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:46,105
three, two. Green light.

582
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,818
- Video will go dark once they jump.
- Go. Go.

583
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,370
Chutes deployed.

584
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:02,956
The rally point.

585
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,959
Link-up with indig agent happens here,

586
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:07,627
half a klick from the drop zone.

587
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,922
He'll arrange safe passage
to the blast site.

588
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,730
Motherfucker!

589
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:30,149
Agent is rogue.
Repeat, we have a bad agent.

590
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,485
- We've been compromised.
- Man down! Man down!

591
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,779
- Fuck.
- Over there!

592
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,197
- Agent is kilo.
- Get pressure on that wound.

593
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,617
We should abort, sir.

594
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,869
- Mr. President.
- Shut it down. Bring them home.

595
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,621
"Match Stick," I repeat, "Match Stick."

596
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,331
Head directly to waypoint X-ray.
How copy, over?

597
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,084
Proceeding to X-ray.

598
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,180
- Hello?
- He's in the bedroom.

599
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,114
Hey, brother.

600
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,180
Say again. Over.

601
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,018
Confirmed, sir.

602
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:50,522
The element is off the X and moving
to extract. Three wounded, one KIA.

603
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,650
I'll need the name, next of kin.

604
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,192
Yes, sir.

605
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,683
Yes?

606
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,603
Sir, President Petrov
is on the line.

607
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,106
I'll take it in here.
Shut the door, please.

608
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,653
- Viktor.
- We know it was your men.

609
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,237
What was?

610
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,448
Did you think we wouldn't detect you?

611
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,284
Whatever you're accusing us of,
I don't know anything about it.

612
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,205
Oh, yes, you do.
And so do the Israelis.

613
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,373
We leaked footage
of the firefight to them.

614
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,543
I can't imagine they'd be pleased

615
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,964
America is conducting covert operations
without consulting with them first.

616
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:00,133
You killed your own men, Viktor.

617
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,303
It was your man who got shot last night.

618
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,057
I mean the blast. We have the intel.

619
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,060
It was you, not terrorists.
It was FSB.

620
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,897
So you humiliate me in Washington,
humiliate me in Moscow,

621
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,775
and now you insult me
with these ridiculous fantasies.

622
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,944
What do you want
out of all of this, Viktor?

623
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:22,447
Justice, for my soldiers who died
on a mission you devised.

624
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,657
If anyone is to blame
for their deaths, it's you.

625
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,909
Goodbye, Viktor.

626
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,123
Francis, what did he say?

627
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,835
I have to finish this letter.

628
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,979
Over the last several hours,

629
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,022
Israeli forces entered
the Jordan Valley.

630
00:46:56,106 --> 00:47:00,152
Eyewitness reports say they've taken up
positions near the encampments

631
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:03,196
where Russian troops are refusing access
to a blast site

632
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,824
where eight of their countrymen
were killed two days ago.

633
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,785
The Israeli Prime Minister
had this to say, quote:

634
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,121
"With both Russian forces
refusing to leave

635
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:14,249
and the presence of covert operations
from other nations..."

636
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,960
Hamas and Hezbollah
are getting involved.

637
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:18,837
How?

638
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,881
They've vowed to raise local militias
if the Israelis cross the border.

639
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:25,051
...nor has the American government
regarding covert operations.

640
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:28,554
- This is gonna be bad.
- Yeah, it sure is.

641
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,556
I should get to the White House.

642
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,893
- Lock the door on the way out?
- Mm-hm.

643
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,743
The Israelis.

644
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,496
I know,
I've been watching the news all night.

645
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,665
We should get to the Situation Room.

646
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,625
Let me finish this first.
I'll be right down.

647
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,252
All right, I'll see you down there.

648
