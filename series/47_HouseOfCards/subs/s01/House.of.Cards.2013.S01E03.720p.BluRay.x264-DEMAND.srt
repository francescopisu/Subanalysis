1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,233
Page 43, section 7.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,754
We'd like some
clarification...

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,230
Section 7 has to do with the
evaluative measures by which...

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,430
"Evaluative measures."

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,352
What we're talking about here
are performance standards.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,430
Plain and simple.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,749
We can't have that.
We open that can of worms...

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,559
Gotta take it out, Frank. The
Administration wants it in.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,596
Then we're all
wasting our time.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,955
Now, look, I can cut down
the frequency of testing,

11
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,599
but it's got to be
a part of the overall...

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,279
That's the thin
edge of a 2-ton wedge.

13
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,316
No way. Non-debatable.
All right, hold on.

14
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,039
There's no harm in
hearing him out, right?

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,159
Frank, what do you
have in mind?

16
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,357
We adjust article 4.
Hand me article 4.

17
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,796
We go every three
years instead of two...

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,156
Frank, for us to
even consider testing...

19
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,317
Marty, we can't
negotiate time intervals here.

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,358
If, I'm just saying if.

21
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,477
The frequency could never
be more than five years.

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,478
Five is a little high. But
if you could bend on that...

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,711
Marty... Wait, wait, wait.
And it's not just frequency.

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,839
Veteran teachers
would have to be exempt

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,555
if they have a proven record of
excellence with the students.

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,710
Well, excuse me
for a moment.

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,950
Corey, will you
take the reins on this?

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,191
Right, so article 4,
in terms of exemptions...

29
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,716
<i>I've been saying for years
that we should tear it down.</i>

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>It's vulgar. It's an
embarrassment to the county.</i>

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,592
<i>But time and time again,
Frank Underwood</i>

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,598
<i>has fought to
keep it standing.</i>

33
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,433
<i>If it weren't for him,
the Peachoid</i>

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,279
<i>would've been
replaced ages ago.</i>

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,319
<i>And Jessica Masters
would still be alive.</i>

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,435
<i>The Congressman needs
to answer for this tragedy.</i>

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,079
What exactly happened?

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,471
A 17-year-old girl
ran off the road,

39
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,717
texting her boyfriend.
And I quote,

40
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,792
"Doesn't the Peachoid
look like a giant..."

41
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,912
And then she lost
control of the car.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,990
Jesus.

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,470
Oren's making a big
fuss in the local press.

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,393
Hmm. And he's pushing the
parents to sue Gaffney.

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,475
Sue Gaffney?
It's in his own jurisdiction.

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,155
It's worth throwing Gaffney under
the bus to drag you into the mess.

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,836
He's after my seat again. Has
he learned absolutely nothing?

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,798
It's a full-on
smear campaign, boss.

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,314
He's out to destroy you.
With this?

50
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,079
It's a peach
for Christ's sake.

51
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,793
Let him make
a fool out of himself.

52
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,395
No, he will make
a fool out of you.

53
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,035
If he spins this right,
gets national coverage.

54
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,679
National coverage?
It's a joke.

55
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,870
And you will be
the butt of it.

56
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,273
We can't afford
that right now.

57
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,876
Not when you're in the spotlight
with the Education Bill.

58
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,429
This thing has caused me
so much damn trouble.

59
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,920
I know.

60
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,360
So who should I call?
Parents?

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,511
Phone call's not gonna cut it.
You need to go down there.

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
Can it wait until Monday?

63
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,356
We get on this thing right
now, we can contain it.

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,476
We wait until Monday,

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,677
and there's no way to know how
much this is gonna blow up on us.

66
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,513
I can't go down to Gaffney.
The unions have just...

67
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,114
We postpone.
They're gonna be livid.

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,919
Marty's reasonable, okay?
He will explain to them...

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,878
And they're just supposed
to understand and accept

70
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,314
that I had to get up
from the negotiating table

71
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,392
because some 2-bit county
administrator wants to...

72
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,800
I don't want to
interrupt you, sir,

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,275
but this is not
just about Oren.

74
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,396
It's about the parents.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,640
Now you think
about the lawsuit.

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,079
What happens if
you have to testify?

77
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,553
Subpoenas. Depositions.

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,310
You get dragged into a court battle,
there is no Education Bill.

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,554
We can't ignore this.

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,316
I just hate this
small ball crap.

81
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,194
It's called the what?

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,198
The peach what?
<i>The Peachoid.</i>

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,319
It's a giant water tower
in the shape of a peach.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,758
Wow. I just googled it.
The Peachoid...

85
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,798
She was 17, Linda.

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
You're right. I'm sorry.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,718
<i>I need another week.</i>
That's not gonna work.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,951
The President makes his speech on Tuesday.
We've already announced.

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,111
Speeches can be rescheduled.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,839
<i>We have to show some progress
on Education, Frank.</i>

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,718
The first 100
days is almost over.

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,639
<i>We push back the speech, it'll look
like we're spinning our wheels.</i>

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,235
All right. I'll work something out.
Thank you, Linda.

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
Frank, these are
the heads of the two

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,994
largest teachers
unions in the country.

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,190
I understand.

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,356
They flew here on a weekend.

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,000
Doug will lead the charge, Congressman
Phillips is well versed...

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,874
They flew here to see you, Frank.
You're managing this bill.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,390
Put this in the other bag. And
I'll be in constant communication.

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,073
Anything big comes up,
I'm a phone call away.

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,278
It's a 300-page document.
We need you in that room.

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,159
I would stay if I could,
but this is my home district.

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,199
Now, Marty, cut me a little slack here.
We'll get it done.

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,396
You and I go way back.
Have I ever let you down?

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,510
No, you haven't.

107
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,830
And I don't
intend to start now.

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
Hello?

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,475
Gillian?
Claire.

110
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,393
So nice to finally meet you.

111
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,711
I'm a little under the weather,
I don't want to get you sick.

112
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,274
Well, if you're
feeling ill, we can...

113
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,920
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's just a cold.

114
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,470
Well, thank you
for coming in.

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,716
Of course.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,792
Shall we talk in my office?

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,314
These are really
cool photographs.

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh, thank you.

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Adam Galloway took the pictures.
Have you heard of him?

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,710
No.

121
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,429
I met him at the Whitney
Biennial a couple years ago

122
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,433
and commissioned him to do these.
He just had a big show at PS1.

123
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,434
I'm not up to date
on the art world.

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
That's all right,
we're not here

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,074
to talk about
photography, are we?

126
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,953
My office is over here.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,912
You run into any trouble, you call me.
I got it covered.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,036
Gene Clancy
know I'm coming?

129
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,150
Just spoke to him.

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,390
Get to it.

131
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,712
Your flight is booked. Leaves in 55 minutes.
Ed will be joining you.

132
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,836
Where's Steve?

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,832
He went home sick
about an hour ago, sir.

134
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,593
I'll be filling in.
What's your name again?

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,114
Edward what?
Meechum.

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,429
You drive fast, Meechum?

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,596
You wanted to talk to me?

138
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,796
Come on in, Zoe.

139
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,553
This is Mrs. Tilden,
owner of...

140
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,472
She knows who I am.

141
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,956
Mrs. Tilden liked your
profile on Catherine Durant.

142
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,230
No, I didn't.

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,869
I loved it.

144
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,236
In-depth. Uncompromising.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,598
Normally I don't read things
before they go to print,

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,359
but Cathy's a friend.

147
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,275
Tell me how you knew she'd
be nominated before she did?

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,150
You want my source?

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,430
Tom says you won't tell him.

150
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,469
I haven't told anyone.

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,710
Well, I own the paper.

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,116
And I'm very grateful
to be working here.

153
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,834
So, you're not
gonna tell me either?

154
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,156
Which do you want,
my source or my integrity?

155
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,430
Tom,

156
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,476
move Zoe's piece to the front
page of Sunday's edition.

157
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,835
Let me think that over.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,311
You think it over as much as you want.
Then put it on the front page.

159
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
I've worked really hard to gain
a foothold with WorldWell.

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,599
Six years ago it was
just me and a MacBook.

161
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,114
I understand.

162
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,913
And I had to juggle two temp
jobs just to pay the rent.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,276
It's your baby. You don't
want to let it go.

164
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,793
Well, I just...

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,033
And you wouldn't
have to, Gillian.

166
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,351
All I want is for you to grow
what you've already built.

167
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,394
I heard you fired
half your staff.

168
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,834
Yes, I did.

169
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,950
That worries me.

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,675
I let them go to
make room for you.

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm just not sure
we're the right match.

172
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,600
To be honest, I'm a little
uncomfortable working with someone

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,239
who's commissioning
famous photographers

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,070
when I can't even buy my
volunteers bus fare to the office.

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,520
Do you know who
Nikki Hemler is?

176
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,230
No.

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,239
Nikki owns one of the biggest
galleries in Chelsea.

178
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,556
She desperately wanted
to represent Adam Galloway.

179
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,478
I delivered on Adam,

180
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,314
and in return she contributes
almost 40 grand a year to CWI.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,836
That money goes to impact studies,
lobbying efforts, research.

182
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,556
WorldWell could benefit from
that sort of money, Gillian,

183
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,395
and we can benefit
from your expertise.

184
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,315
Can I think about it?

185
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,357
Of course. We don't have
to jump into anything.

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,996
I grew up here,
in the up-country.

187
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,999
Bibles, barbecues
and broken backs.

188
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,511
Everything gets just a little
bit thicker this far south.

189
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,791
The air, the blood, even me.

190
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,760
I try to make it down here
at least once a month.

191
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,435
Every trip is a reminder
of how far I've come.

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,150
I hated Gaffney as a kid,
when I had nothing.

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,590
But now,
I've come to appreciate it.

194
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,677
It's not as
suffocating as it once was,

195
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,592
except when I have to deal
with the sort of nonsense

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,592
that makes me
want to hang myself.

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,433
<i>Turn left on Route 120.</i>

198
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,596
Don't listen to her.
I know a better way.

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,710
Yes, sir.

200
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,473
We don't have
the money, Frank.

201
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,273
The legal bills
alone will kill us.

202
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,233
How about a settlement?

203
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,432
I'll look
at the numbers.

204
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,274
What's it look like
to you?

205
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Like a peach.

206
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,474
No, I mean,
what does it really look like?

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,990
As mayor,
I stick with a peach.

208
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,430
As a private citizen,

209
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,155
well it looks like the sun is
shining where it shouldn't be.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,878
There's a better
way to handle this.

211
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,710
Really, Frank?
And what's that?

212
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,637
I'm not trying to
start an argument here.

213
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,752
Now, you make it sound like
I'm in the wrong.

214
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,714
You know exactly
what you're doing, Oren.

215
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,916
You're using this
poor girl's death

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,196
for your own
political advantage.

217
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,839
You're the one that fought me

218
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,071
when the Peach Farmers bitched and
moaned about me tearing it down.

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,310
You're the one who
took their money.

220
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,993
It's a water tower.
It's ungodly.

221
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,992
Oren...
This is cut and dry, Frank.

222
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,439
I fought to tear it down,
you fought to keep it up.

223
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,672
That girl's blood
is on your hands.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,719
And I'm taking
you to task for it.

225
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,793
All right, I tell you what, Dick
Peters is gonna retire this term.

226
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,870
That means there's an open
race in the 4th district.

227
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,633
How about I help
you lock up that seat?

228
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,838
I'm not looking to
make a deal, Frank.

229
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,114
It's not a deal,
it's an opportunity.

230
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
I'll be just fine.

231
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,511
You may despise me, Oren,

232
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,199
but the classy thing
to do would've been

233
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,953
to invite us up for
some of that iced tea.

234
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,436
What are you doing?

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,920
You shouldn't run here.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,593
It's disgraceful.

237
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,751
Have you no respect?

238
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,036
The criteria is
a starting point.

239
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,316
They're suggested,
not mandated.

240
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
<i>We assemble a council of experts
who will determine exactly...</i>

241
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,197
Nowhere here does
it say who these

242
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,277
experts are or how
they'll be chosen.

243
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,953
<i>The President
selects the council.</i>

244
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,230
With what sort
of oversight?

245
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,510
We'd like input
on the selection.

246
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,954
<i>Doug, check with Linda.</i>

247
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,474
Calling her now.

248
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,759
Okay, so, now, can we talk
about charter schools?

249
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,110
Charter schools
are a no-go.

250
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,230
<i>They have to be in there.</i>

251
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,356
You keep them in,
we walk.

252
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,516
The same goes for us.

253
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>Let's not jump to ultimatums.</i>

254
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,396
Well, then let's figure out a way
to reduce non-public spending.

255
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,279
All right. Give me a few
minutes to think about that.

256
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,955
We can't move forward
without addressing this point.

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,311
I understand, but this is
the cornerstone of the bill.

258
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,794
Let's talk it out.

259
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,917
<i>All right, give me five minutes, Marty.
I'll call you right back.</i>

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,070
No, no...

261
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,395
If we consider
settling as an option,

262
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,715
we need to be
able to pay them.

263
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,793
But if we offer a settlement,
aren't we saying...

264
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,798
That's my point,
we're admitting that

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,832
the town's responsible
for this kid's death.

266
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,793
I say make the Peach
Farmers cough it up.

267
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,798
Oh, man,
talk about a shitstorm.

268
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
Y'all mind catching me up?

269
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,272
Wayne and Travis
want to go to court.

270
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,635
I don't think
that's a good idea.

271
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,717
We can't be pouring
money into a settlement

272
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,797
when we can barely
afford to run the city.

273
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,155
What do you think, Jamie?

274
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,193
I think that we gotta worry about
the Peach Farmers Association.

275
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,273
If there is a hint that
we're blaming the Peachoid,

276
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,312
they're gonna raise holy hell...
Who gives a crap?

277
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
They gotta suck it up.
Let him talk.

278
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,751
I'm just saying that we need
to keep them in mind.

279
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,479
She was breaking the law.
End of story.

280
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,193
You can't text
while you drive.

281
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,237
Yeah, but all the jury
is gonna see

282
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,272
is a beautiful 17-year-old
girl who's now dead.

283
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,953
No offense, Frank,
but you just got here.

284
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,992
We've been dealing with this
for the last week now.

285
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,230
And where's
your solution?

286
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,070
What, you think you
know better than us?

287
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,953
I'm just trying
to be realistic.

288
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,112
Frank, I know you want to
swoop down and save the day.

289
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,993
But there's a principle
at stake here.

290
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,912
We allow ourselves to be extorted
because of this teenager...

291
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,590
When Oren gets a jury to weep a
river of snot over this dead girl,

292
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,995
when Gaffney goes tits up

293
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,197
because you can't afford to pay a
seven-figure award in damages,

294
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,438
when you all get booted out of
office, and I lose to Chase,

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,115
then you can chew my ear off
about principles,

296
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,398
because we'll all have nothing
but time on our hands.

297
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,110
Until then, you either contribute
or you keep it shut, Travis.

298
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,270
Now here's what
we're gonna do.

299
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,636
Gene, how much could we pull together
for a settlement if we had to?

300
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,632
About 150.
That'll work.

301
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,313
Jamie, get your boys down
at the hardware store

302
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,039
to build two billboards,
put them out

303
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,719
a mile out on
either side of the tower.

304
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,389
Have 'em read, "Drive safely.
No texting behind the wheel."

305
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,239
Got it. And get those
up by tomorrow morning.

306
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,390
I'll issue the permits.

307
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,791
And let's stop
lighting the thing at night.

308
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,320
The Peach Farmers
aren't gonna like that.

309
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,914
How much does
the electric cost?

310
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,319
$4,100 plus change per month.
About $50,000 a year.

311
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,080
Jesus, you could put a kid
through college on it...

312
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,478
Let's use that money to start a
scholarship fund in her name.

313
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,473
Meantime, you tell the Association if
they want it lit up, they can pay for it.

314
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,960
I'll deliver that
message happily.

315
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,839
And do me up a budget and a plan
for removing the sphincter.

316
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
The what?

317
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,198
He means
the emergency valve.

318
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,034
That's interesting, I've always
thought of it as a clitoris.

319
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,034
But it's on bottom. I believe
the clitoris is above the...

320
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,389
But if you imagine
a woman on her belly...

321
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,749
Enough.

322
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I want it done.

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,516
And, Gene, get me everything
you've got on road regulations.

324
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,836
County statutes,
not municipal.

325
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,633
And you remember
that power line business

326
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,353
we pulled up at
the last election?

327
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,430
Sure do.

328
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,592
Let's make sure
we're rock solid on that.

329
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,519
Does this very
expensive dinner

330
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,276
at least buy me an evening of
mind-blowing sexual congress?

331
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,359
It was good, but I don't
know if it was that good...

332
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,356
Fellatio good?

333
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,510
A hand job, maybe.
No promises.

334
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,636
Deal.

335
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,073
Hey, um, Peter, there's
something I need to tell you.

336
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,038
I have been thinking lately,

337
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,551
you know, um, it might be
good to work somewhere else.

338
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,719
So I did some interviews.

339
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,309
And the Speaker's office
offered me Deputy L.D.

340
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,956
Peter?

341
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,909
Christina, um...

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,514
I just thought it
could be good, right,

343
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,074
if we're going to
have any future.

344
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,834
To stop this boss-staffer thing.
Be a real couple...

345
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,956
We are a real couple.

346
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,033
I mean, not have to hide it,
like we do at the office.

347
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,598
And it's a great
opportunity. The Speaker.

348
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,320
Would you hate me
if I took the job?

349
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,197
Baby, I want
what you want.

350
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,400
I won't fight you on this. Not if
this is what you feel you need to do.

351
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,670
Really?
Yeah.

352
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,719
And you're right.
This is a great opportunity.

353
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,475
When do you have
to tell them by?

354
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,711
There's no deadline. I don't
have to decide right away.

355
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,479
Okay.
Well, when you do decide,

356
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,313
just, you know,
help me find a replacement.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,480
You know,
give me a heads up.

358
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,080
Yeah, of course.

359
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,035
I haven't even decided
if I'm going to take it.

360
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
We don't have to talk
this through right now.

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,394
I just thought
I'd bring it up.

362
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,630
Should we get out of here?

363
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,830
Yes.

364
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,757
Let's go find the parents.

365
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,910
You hang back by the car.

366
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,196
It's a big crowd, sir.

367
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,155
If I get shot or stabbed
consoling two grieving parents,

368
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,279
I'm a hero from now
until the end of time.

369
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,840
Let's roll the die,
shall we?

370
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,913
Sir, I can't allow you to go
unescorted into all those people.

371
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,636
Allow me?

372
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
Let's get one thing
straight, Meechum.

373
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,952
You are never to dictate
what I can and cannot do.

374
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,432
The only two words I want to hear from
you when I ask you to do something

375
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,874
are "yes" and "sir."

376
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,910
Is that understood?

377
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,190
Yes, sir.

378
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,716
Good. Then we're
gonna get along just fine.

379
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,834
Mr. and Mrs. Masters, I'm Frank
Underwood, your Congressman.

380
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

381
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,710
I cannot begin to fathom...

382
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,956
You're right, you can't.

383
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,713
You have no idea.

384
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,949
Forgive me. I don't
mean to intrude. I just...

385
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,395
Well, you are intruding.

386
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,709
Dean, please...

387
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,792
What? It's his fault,
isn't it?

388
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,871
Anyway, I just wanted
to express my condolences

389
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,633
and say if there's
anything the two of you...

390
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,276
Dean, you don't want to be talking to him.
We got legal action pending.

391
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,477
Look, I know what Mr. Chase has
been saying, and believe...

392
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,040
Nobody invited you.

393
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,555
Nobody wants your condolences,
or your excuses.

394
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,274
Frank, please.

395
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,479
You shouldn't have to put
up with this right now.

396
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,635
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,830
Well, that went well.

398
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,916
Hang on a second.
Reverend!

399
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,069
Congressman.

400
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,712
Nice to see you again. I wish it
was under better circumstances.

401
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,353
Terrible, isn't it?
It's just terrible.

402
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,000
This is so thoughtful,
what you've organized here.

403
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,639
Least we can do.

404
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,070
Tell me, are the Masters
in your congregation?

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,595
They are.
They come every Sunday.

406
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,036
You think they'll be
at the service tomorrow?

407
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,713
I'd be surprised
if they weren't.

408
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,398
I'm wondering,
can you do me a favor?

409
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,839
Anything for you, Frank.

410
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,713
Oh, the blue toothbrush
is yours, right?

411
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,639
Uh, yeah,
the blue one.

412
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,394
Yeah?
Hey, Peter?

413
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,914
Where do you keep
the light bulbs?

414
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
The lamp in
the bedroom is out.

415
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,836
In the kitchen,
under the sink.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,229
Here's what I think,

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,959
and I wish I could be bigger
than this, but I can't.

418
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,555
And I'm being selfish, and I
realize it's mostly about me,

419
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,120
but fuck it.

420
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,316
I have to say it.

421
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,631
Please don't take that
other job, Christina.

422
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,154
Anyway, that's how I feel.

423
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,156
I'm glad you told me.

424
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,240
Charters jeopardize our ability to
organize, which is reason enough.

425
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,592
But the bigger issue is that
measuring their success against...

426
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,319
Charter schools
would operate under

427
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,079
the same evaluative
standards that every...

428
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,992
Apples and oranges,
no matter how you look at it.

429
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,197
You can't use the same
standards to compare.

430
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,676
<i>What, you're advocating
a more demanding criteria</i>

431
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,876
<i>for charter schools
than other schools?</i>

432
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,996
Our point is simple, Frank.

433
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,756
<i>Federal funds should only go to
public union school districts.</i>

434
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,990
Hold on a sec.

435
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,995
Yeah, but we've already increased
non-charter funding by 10%.

436
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,755
The amount going to charter
schools is negligible.

437
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,991
<i>It's the precedent,
Frank, not the number.</i>

438
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,517
We're setting a lot of precedents, Marty.
That's the nature of reform.

439
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,838
Well, some of them we can
stomach, some of them we can't.

440
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,320
<i>All right,
let's not get bogged down</i>

441
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,874
<i>in abstractions,
let's deal with specifics.</i>

442
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,077
<i>Corey, can you
walk us through it?</i>

443
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,835
There is
a three-prong approach

444
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,593
to determining the amount
of funding a particular...

445
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,676
Miss me?

446
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,120
Maybe a little.

447
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,271
What's it been, 15 hours?

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,550
Oh.

449
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,360
Not even long enough
to notice you're gone.

450
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,477
<i>Tell that to Marty Spinella.</i>

451
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,358
How's it coming?
<i>It's coming.</i>

452
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,719
Slowly. Painfully.

453
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,720
Hey, have we always had
tulips in the front yard,

454
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,638
or am I slowly going insane?

455
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,393
<i>I planted them. Last fall.</i>

456
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,596
You did not.

457
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,395
When I was down with
you for the campaign.

458
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,275
You've never gardened
a day in your life.

459
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,831
Not true. I have gardened
exactly one day in my life.

460
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,272
You were down in Spartanburg
doing some sort of fundraiser.

461
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,998
Gene's wife came over
with a bucket of bulbs.

462
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,436
And next thing you know I was
down on my knees in the dirt,

463
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,914
earthworms and all.

464
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,158
I can't even picture it.

465
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,674
Neither can I,
and I was there.

466
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,353
<i>What else?</i>

467
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,432
Distract me from giant peaches
and dead teenagers.

468
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,234
What else...

469
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,669
Oh,

470
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,113
I went for a run today,
and the strangest...

471
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,396
I don't know, this woman...

472
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,870
<i>That's interesting.</i>

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,990
What is?

474
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,951
Text just came.
Zoe Barnes.

475
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,270
<i>Who?</i>

476
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,670
Oh, that reporter from
<i>The Herald</i> you met one night.

477
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,274
Oh, her. I remember. Yeah, go,
if you need to call her back.

478
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,438
No, she can wait.
I'm talking to my wife.

479
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,672
That's okay. I'm going to bed soon anyway.
See you tomorrow?

480
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,400
I hope so.
Wish me luck.

481
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,512
<i>Bonsoir, ma petite</i> Peachoid.

482
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,310
Disgusting.

483
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,473
<i>Good night.</i>
Good night.

484
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,791
Yeah, all right,
that's fine, Corey. Marty?

485
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,111
<i>Frank, had a little bit of explaining to do.
Here's our problem.</i>

486
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,030
<i>Frank? Frank, did we lose you?</i>

487
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,714
Yeah, I'm here, Marty.

488
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,157
Look, we can talk ourselves in
circles about charter schools,

489
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,276
but here's what I propose...

490
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,153
<i>In your profile you
go into great detail</i>

491
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,789
<i>about the sexism Durant faced
early on in her career.</i>

492
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,310
<i>That's right. Um, when she
was first elected,</i>

493
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,875
<i>it was still an old
boys' club in the Senate.</i>

494
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,394
<i>Journalism used to be that
way too not so long ago.</i>

495
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,113
<i>I feel really lucky.</i>

496
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,511
<i>I've had lots of
trailblazers come before me.</i>

497
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,319
<i>For instance,
my colleague, Janine Skorsky,</i>

498
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,073
<i>was the first
woman at</i> The Herald

499
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,913
<i>to become chief
political correspondent.</i>

500
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,559
<i>And that was
only five years ago.</i>

501
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,712
<i>Has it been those trailblazers who've
allowed you to rise so quickly?</i>

502
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,598
<i>You've moved up
from the metro pages</i>

503
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,558
<i>to the front
page Sunday edition.</i>

504
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>Well, I don't know that
that would be possible</i>

505
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,160
<i>if Janine hadn't
already paved the way.</i>

506
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,310
<i>So does that
mean that</i> The Herald

507
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,510
<i>is not particularly
progressive?</i>

508
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,636
<i>I think that they are.</i>

509
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,200
<i>Tom is very open-minded.</i>

510
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,078
<i>He's the reason
Janine got promoted.</i>

511
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,117
<i>That's Tom Hammerschmidt,
the executive editor.</i>

512
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,634
<i>Yes, we actually
call him "The Hammer."</i>

513
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
<i>"The Hammer"? Why?</i>

514
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,029
<i>Because he's tough.</i>

515
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
<i>How tough?</i>

516
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,954
<i>He's... Uh...</i>

517
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,833
<i>Tom has very high standards.</i>

518
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,956
<i>I love him</i>.

519
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,073
<i>He's a great mentor.</i>

520
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,673
<i>Um, it can be
frustrating at times. Um...</i>

521
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,710
<i>He makes you double
and triple-check things.</i>

522
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,713
<i>And you want to get the news
out the moment you have it,</i>

523
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,792
<i>and he makes you
rewrite until it's perfect,</i>

524
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,952
<i>but that's what makes</i>
The Herald The Herald.

525
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,680
<i>Is that a workable
model in the Internet age?</i>

526
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,234
<i>Our readers think it is.</i>

527
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,312
<i>You have
a declining readership.</i>

528
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,392
<i>But I don't lay
that at Tom's feet.</i>

529
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,557
<i>I think that that's
the times we live in, right?</i>

530
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,354
<i>Should newspapers
adapt to the times we live in?</i>

531
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,314
<i>It's not that</i>
The Herald <i>refuses to adapt.</i>

532
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,039
<i>We have an online presence.</i>

533
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,595
<i>Is that maybe not
adapting fast enough?</i>

534
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,916
<i>I wouldn't argue
with that statement.</i>

535
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,919
<i>We could do more.</i>

536
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,440
We've got a special
guest with us today.

537
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,196
He asked for
the opportunity to share

538
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,630
a few words with
us this morning.

539
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,916
Our very own Congressman,
Frank Underwood.

540
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,550
Good morning.

541
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,710
Good morning.

542
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,198
Thank you, Reverend. And thanks to
the choir for that beautiful hymn.

543
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,631
I want to read
this morning from...

544
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,750
No.

545
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,595
You know what no one
wants to talk about?

546
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,596
Hate.

547
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,640
I know all about hate.

548
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,278
It starts in your gut.
Deep down here.

549
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,274
Where it stirs and churns.
And then it rises.

550
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,280
Hate rises, fast and volcanic.

551
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,479
It erupts, hot on the breath.

552
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,676
Your eyes go wide with fire.

553
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,594
You clench your teeth so hard
you think they'll shatter.

554
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,192
I hate you, God.

555
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,680
I hate you!

556
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,478
Oh, don't tell me you haven't said
those words before. I know you have.

557
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
We all have.

558
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,798
If you've ever felt
soul-crushing loss.

559
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,478
There are two parents with
us today who know that pain.

560
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,317
The most terrible hurt of all,
losing a child before her time.

561
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,711
If Dean and Leanne were
to stand up right now

562
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,271
and scream those awful words
of hate, could we blame them?

563
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,840
I couldn't.

564
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,551
At least their hatred I can understand.
I can grasp it.

565
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,391
But God's wantonness,
his cruelty,

566
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,037
I can't even begin to...

567
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,551
My father dropped
dead of a heart attack

568
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,797
at the age of 43,
43 years old.

569
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,590
And when he died, I looked up
to God and I said those words.

570
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,116
Because my
father was so young,

571
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,550
so full of life,
so full of dreams.

572
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,276
Why would God
take him from us?

573
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,435
Truth be told I never really knew
him, or what his dreams were.

574
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,080
He was quiet,
timid, almost invisible.

575
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,800
My mother didn't think much of him.
My mother's mother hated him.

576
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,111
The man never scratched
the surface of life.

577
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,032
Maybe it's best
he died so young,

578
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,078
he wasn't doing much
but taking up space.

579
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,880
But that doesn't make for a very
powerful eulogy, now does it?

580
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,317
I wept. I screamed, "Why, God?

581
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,755
"How can I not hate you
when you steal from me

582
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,840
"the person I most love
and admire in this world?

583
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,958
"I don't understand it,
and I hate you for it."

584
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,119
The Bible says in Proverbs,

585
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,676
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

586
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,240
"and lean not on
your own understanding.

587
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,076
"Lean not on your
own understanding."

588
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,840
God is telling
us to trust him.

589
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,594
To love him despite
our own ignorance.

590
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,913
After all, what is faith if it doesn't
endure when we are tested the most?

591
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,556
We will never understand
why God took Jessica,

592
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,390
or my father or anyone.

593
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,758
And while God may not
give us any answers,

594
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,078
he has given us
the capacity for love.

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,716
Our job is to love him
without questioning his plan.

596
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,631
So I pray to you, dear Lord.

597
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,474
I pray to you to help
strengthen our love for you,

598
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,510
and to embrace Dean and Leanne with
the warmth of your love in return.

599
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,954
And I pray that you will
help us fend off hatred,

600
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,560
so that we may all truly trust
in you with all our hearts,

601
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,639
and lean not on our
own understanding.

602
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,676
Amen.

603
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,195
<i>Amen.</i>

604
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,636
Your job is to the report
the news, not be the news.

605
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,155
I was promoting the paper.

606
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,549
You were promoting
Zoe Barnes.

607
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,916
Is this about how I said
we called you "The Hammer"?

608
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,990
Because if that
upset you, I apologize.

609
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,150
You're missing the point.

610
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,911
I don't want you talking about
anything that happens here.

611
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,192
Not nicknames,
not how progressive we are,

612
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,277
not whether we're
adapting to the Internet.

613
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,870
Any thoughts you have about this
paper you keep them to yourself

614
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,229
or you bring them to me.

615
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,840
You don't get on national
television and start...

616
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,956
I'm sorry,
I wasn't trying to...

617
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,520
Don't interrupt
when I'm talking.

618
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,472
You can speak to me
like an adult, Tom.

619
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,279
You don't have to
lecture me like a little girl.

620
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,831
You haven't earned the right
to be treated as an adult.

621
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,317
You think a few front page
stories and some face time on TV

622
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,357
makes you
the next Judy Miller?

623
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,310
You've got a long way to go.
Don't be so arrogant.

624
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,517
Okay, so you think
when a woman asks

625
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,711
to be treated with respect,
that's arrogance?

626
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
Are you accusing me of sexism?

627
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,473
Just making an observation.

628
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,190
No TV for a month.

629
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,834
What?

630
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,519
You heard me. No interviews.

631
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,790
That's completely unfair.

632
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,115
You want to make it
no TV indefinitely?

633
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,960
We're done. You can go now.

634
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,595
Hello?

635
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,392
<i>Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.
Can I come up?</i>

636
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,959
Have you seen a doctor?

637
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,556
Giardia's not so bad. It'll
pass in another week or so.

638
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,995
You don't have health
insurance, do you? Nope.

639
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,679
I'll make
an appointment for you

640
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,359
to see my
personal GP tomorrow.

641
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,193
Medicine doesn't
really do much.

642
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,118
You have to let
it run its course.

643
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,715
Well, we'll let it run its
course under proper supervision.

644
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,190
I won't take no for an answer on this.
Claire...

645
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,317
I'll drag you to the hospital
myself if I have to.

646
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,637
You're going to the doctor.
No argument.

647
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,120
Thanks.

648
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,032
They're about to walk. They
won't listen to a word I say.

649
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,719
Both unions?
<i>Yeah.</i>

650
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,870
Put Marty on the phone.

651
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,878
Hang on. Marty.

652
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,917
Yeah. It's Frank?

653
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,714
This isn't working, Frank.

654
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,474
Marty, you have got
to keep them in that room.

655
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,193
They lost their patience,
all right?

656
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,913
They're upset you're
not in the room, Frank.

657
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,275
I'll be back this afternoon.

658
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,629
<i>No. It's too late.</i>

659
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,589
Look, tell them I'll come down on
subsidies for charter schools.

660
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,673
Even so, they're angry about
the performance standards.

661
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,160
We're not even
halfway through this thing.

662
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,555
There's so much
in it that they...

663
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Then tell them
that I'll roll over on

664
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
performance standards.
Five-year intervals.

665
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,916
It should be you
telling them that, Frank.

666
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,276
<i>You, here at this table.</i>

667
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,317
I know that. You know, I'm
doing the best I can, Marty.

668
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,278
But I can't be in
two places at once.

669
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,990
Now look, I promise you,
if you keep them in that room,

670
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,517
we will get through this hump
as soon as I get back.

671
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,992
Marty, you are their lobbyist.
You know what's best for them.

672
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,271
Save them from themselves.

673
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,470
Okay.
I'll see what I could do.

674
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,356
It's Stamper.

675
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,511
Do not let Spinella
out of your sight.

676
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,070
And lock the goddamn
doors if you have to.

677
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,270
You got it.

678
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,160
Here we go.

679
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,436
I know you're a busy man, I
hope we're not keeping you...

680
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,637
No, no, no. I've got
all the time in the world.

681
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,714
This is ham and these are turkey.
And there's some potato salad.

682
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,156
Shall we have a prayer?

683
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,549
Gracious loving God...

684
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,394
Have you had this before?

685
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,795
This is
the third time.

686
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,109
I'm used to it by now.

687
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,551
Well, I'm not used to it,
but it beats malaria.

688
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,955
You've had malaria?

689
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,555
In Zimbabwe.
That took me out for a month.

690
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,115
You make a lot of sacrifices.

691
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,998
I don't see it as a sacrifice.

692
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,514
You turned down
a six-figure salary

693
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,120
at Google to start
your own non-profit.

694
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,557
People don't get
malaria in Palo Alto.

695
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,750
You do your research.

696
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,953
When it's
someone I care about.

697
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,989
Claire, I turned down that job
because I would've hated myself.

698
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,077
It was a lot of money,
but for what?

699
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,072
So they could fill
their diversity quota

700
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,152
with an Asian girl
peddling a Stanford degree?

701
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,994
Not just any Asian girl.
A valedictorian.

702
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,798
Let me offer you
what Google couldn't.

703
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,749
I know what it is to be capable
and beautiful and ambitious,

704
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,749
and be on people like Sergey
and Larry's checklist

705
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,320
of things that look
good to have on a shelf.

706
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,953
I'm not trying to
acquisition you.

707
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,432
What I see in you is a woman I
admire, which doesn't happen often.

708
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,917
I want to enable you. I want
to clear the way for you.

709
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,789
So that you can achieve what you
want to achieve, on your own terms.

710
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,233
Thanks for the tea.

711
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,110
And I will send a car to pick
you up for the doctor tomorrow.

712
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,356
When you're back on your feet,

713
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,399
do you think maybe
we can work something out?

714
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,792
Yes, I think we could.

715
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,997
That's her
at junior prom.

716
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,156
Beautiful.

717
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,356
Here she is in
her letter-jacket.

718
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,632
She made varsity
as a freshman.

719
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,593
I remember
the day she found out.

720
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,516
Coach called, and Jessie
starts jumping up and down,

721
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,038
"Mom, guess what?"

722
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,230
I'm sorry.

723
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,079
Don't be. It's fine.

724
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,750
Why are we doing this?

725
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,432
Honestly. What's to be gained
dredging up all this stuff?

726
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,558
Remembering the good
things helps sometimes.

727
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,711
Not when it puts
my wife in tears.

728
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,680
I appreciate what you said at the
church, but it doesn't do us any good.

729
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,160
Neither does this.

730
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,720
Well, what can I do to help?

731
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,274
You can't do anything.

732
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,033
She's gone.

733
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,157
You're right.
I can't change that.

734
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,157
But I can make sure the city
offers you a sizable settlement.

735
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,833
You mean buy us off?

736
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,550
No, I mean help you avoiding
years of court battles.

737
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,912
Jessica was gonna go to
Furman, is that right?

738
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,559
On a volleyball scholarship?

739
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,313
Yes, a full ride.

740
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,636
Well, I spoke to the president
of the university this morning,

741
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,713
and we'd like to create a new
scholarship in your daughter's name.

742
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,236
If you'd like that.
It's entirely up to you.

743
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,558
But most importantly we have to make
sure that this never happens again.

744
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,519
We've got safety
billboards going up,

745
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,234
stopped lighting
the tower at night,

746
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,760
and we're putting
the guardrails in...

747
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,475
Should've done all that
before she ran off the road.

748
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,239
Would you like me to resign,
Mr. Masters?

749
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,753
Just say the word
and it's done.

750
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,071
If it will bring
you any satisfaction.

751
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,353
I asked the reverend once,

752
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,992
"What are we supposed to do in the
face of so much senseless pain?"

753
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,395
And he said to me,

754
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,834
"What else can we do

755
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,953
"but take what
seems meaningless,

756
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,953
"and try to make something
meaningful from it?"

757
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
He's right.

758
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,269
That's how God
works through us.

759
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,034
Will you let me work for you?

760
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,871
What you have to understand
about my people

761
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,917
is that they are
a noble people.

762
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,509
Humility is
their form of pride.

763
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,155
It is their strength.
It is their weakness.

764
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,639
And if you can humble
yourself before them,

765
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,151
they will do anything you ask.

766
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,993
Tell us more
about the scholarship.

767
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,909
Hey.

768
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,549
Hey.
What're you doing?

769
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,919
Working.
On what?

770
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,116
The BRAC Commission stuff.
I'm behind on it.

771
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,110
It's Sunday.

772
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,515
So?

773
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,551
You don't usually
work on the weekend.

774
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,715
Well, now I do.

775
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,520
There's coffee in the
kitchen if you want some.

776
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,715
Peter?

777
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,910
Peter.

778
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,554
If I decide to stay,
it's because it's what I want,

779
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,676
not what you want.

780
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,029
I understand.

781
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,150
Which draft are you reading
of the written testimony?

782
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,390
The one you sent
out on Thursday.

783
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,277
I actually changed it on Friday.
Can I show you?

784
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,633
Yeah, I was thinking that we
could start with job numbers,

785
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,194
and then go to
economic multipliers,

786
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,800
instead of
the other way around.

787
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,996
What do you think?

788
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,440
Let's see
what it looks like.

789
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,752
Picture this, a 17-year-old girl
traveling at 60 miles an hour

790
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,271
spins out of control in no
traffic, she hits a guardrail,

791
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,194
but if she's wearing a
seatbelt, which she was,

792
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,239
and her car doesn't roll over
three times down a 20-foot ditch,

793
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,279
which it did, then that
young woman is still alive.

794
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,400
But you know what?

795
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,200
The county administrator
didn't build those guardrails,

796
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,634
so now she's dead.

797
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,870
We looked up the statute. Guardrails
are under county supervision.

798
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,832
Are you trying to
turn this around on me?

799
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,155
That's not all, Oren.

800
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,515
Your easement.

801
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,791
You see every couple of years,
the Piedmont Electric,

802
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,951
they apply to bring power
lines through Gaffney.

803
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,918
The route comes
right through your lot.

804
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,679
Now Gene and I
always fight them off,

805
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,871
but this year,
if they were to re-apply? Hmm.

806
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,235
Eminent domain.

807
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,630
It'd be such a shame to have to
tear down this beautiful home.

808
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,640
Fuck you, Frank.

809
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,032
You can't just roll up on my
property and act like you own it.

810
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,240
Oh, but I can.

811
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,640
We just did.

812
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,600
I've won this
district 11 times.

813
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,718
Do you think that's just luck
and a firm handshake?

814
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,512
But I'll tell you what.
I'm not a vindictive person.

815
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,355
I don't like for anybody to
lose if everybody can win.

816
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,352
So I'm gonna help you
get elected in the 4th.

817
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,358
You get to keep your house.
I keep the 5th.

818
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,877
We put the Peachoid behind us. And
everybody's happy. What do you say?

819
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,194
Well, that's alright.
You think about it.

820
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,749
I'm sure you'll
do the right thing.

821
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,639
Oh, and I'm looking forward to
having you in Congress, Oren.

822
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,280
It's always good
to have friends

823
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,880
on the other
side of the aisle.

824
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,110
I've been offered
a spot on <i>Nightline.</i>

825
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,277
<i>You want my advice?</i>

826
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,760
I don't want it,
I need it.

827
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,235
Close your eyes.

828
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,230
Okay.

829
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,629
<i>It's 11:25.</i>

830
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,270
<i>Nightline</i> is about to come on.
Millions of people are watching.

831
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,160
Where are you? Home?

832
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,915
No.

833
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,230
<i>At the studio?</i>

834
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,390
Yes.

835
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,799
<i>And what do you see?</i>

836
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,918
I see lights. I see a camera.

837
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,397
<i>And that little red dot goes on.
Tell me what you hear.</i>

838
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,113
I hear my voice.

839
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,199
<i>And those millions of people,
what do they hear?</i>

840
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,475
My voice.

841
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,080
<i>And what do they see?</i>

842
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,594
My face.

843
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,317
So you don't need my advice.

844
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,360
Hammerschmidt's gonna freak.

845
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,153
You don't want
to work anywhere

846
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,953
you're not willing to
get fired from, Zoe.

847
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,636
Treading water is the same as
drowning for people like you and me.

848
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,110
Good luck. I'll be watching.

849
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,190
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

850
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,033
Yes?
When do you get back?

851
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,871
When I get back, you'll know.

852
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,760
Hello, Nancy.

853
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,314
Welcome back, sir.

854
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,709
Linda Vasquez
called for you.

855
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,598
Tell her I'll call in a
couple hours with an update.

856
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,750
Very well.
Sir,

857
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,995
unless you need anything,
Kyle has you covered.

858
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,514
No. Go home.

859
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,110
You did well this weekend.

860
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,509
Thank you, sir.

861
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,111
Oh, and before you go home,
can you do me a favor?

862
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,674
Would you swing by my house and
make sure these get to Claire?

863
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,035
Yes, sir.

864
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,477
And thank you,
sir, for being so patient.

865
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,876
Okay.
