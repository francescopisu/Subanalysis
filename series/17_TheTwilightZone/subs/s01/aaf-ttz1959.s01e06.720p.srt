00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,215
(male presenter, off)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,801
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,470
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,098
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:20,060
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,604
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,025
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,819
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,405
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:42,166
IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,879
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET
A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:51,341
WITNESS MR. WALTER BEDEKER,
AGE 44,

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,177
AFRAID OF THE FOLLOWING,

15
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,722
DEATH, DISEASE, OTHER PEOPLE,
GERMS, DRAFT

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,891
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

17
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,102
HE HAS ONE INTEREST IN LIFE,
AND THAT'S WALTER BEDEKER.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,937
ONE PREOCCUPATION,

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,107
THE LIFE AND WELLBEING
OF WALTER BEDEKER.

20
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,443
ONE ABIDING CONCERN
ABOUT SOCIETY,

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,237
THAT IF WALTER BEDEKER
SHOULD DIE,

22
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,742
HOW WILL IT SURVIVE
WITHOUT HIM?

23
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,334
WELL?

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,711
DOCTOR, I ASKED
YOU A QUESTION.

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,338
HOW BAD IS IT?

26
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,090
OH, IT ISN'T
BAD AT ALL.

27
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,382
IT'S QUITE GOOD.

28
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,676
YOU HAVE
NO TEMPERATURE.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,762
PRESSURE NORMAL,
RESPIRATION NORMAL,

30
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,847
HEART ACTION NORMAL,
NO INFECTION,

31
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,267
THROAT CLEAR,
NASAL PASSAGES
CLEAR, EARS CLEAR.

32
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,521
WHAT ABOUT THE PAINS
IN MY BACK AND SIDE?

33
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,940
WHAT ABOUT FOUR
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS IN A ROW?

34
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,943
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

35
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,695
THAT, MR. BEDEKER,
IS PSYCHOSOMATIC.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,407
PSYCHO-- YOU MEAN THAT
I'M SICK ONLY IN MY M IND?

37
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,618
THAT IS MY
CONSIDERED OPINION.

38
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,454
MR. BEDEKER, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU

39
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,707
EXCEPT THESE AILMENTS
YOU MANUFACTURE FOR YOURSELF.

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,584
YOUR PAINS ARE IMAGINARY.

41
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,295
YOUR INABILITY TO SLEEP
IS A CASE OF NERVES.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,131
NOTHING MORE.

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,759
IN SHORT, MR. BEDEKER,
YOU'RE A VERY HEALTHY MAN.

44
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,970
YOU SEE,
THAT'S A DOCTOR.

45
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,597
FOUR YEARS PREMED,
FOUR YEARS MEDICAL SCHOOL,

46
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,975
TWO YEARS INTERNSHIP,
TWO YEARS RESIDENCY,

47
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,393
AND WHAT IS HE?

48
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,395
I ASK YOU, WHAT IS HE?

49
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,980
A QUACK!

50
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,398
[door opens]

51
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,983
DOCTOR, HOW IS HE?

52
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,401
OH, DON'T ASK HIM.

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,153
THE MAN'S AN IDIOT.

54
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,780
WALTER, DON'T EXCITE
YOURSELF, PLEASE.

55
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,323
THEN STOP WHISPERING.

56
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,992
THERE'S HALF MY TROUBLE.

57
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,161
THIS WOMAN GOES
AROUND WHISPERING,

58
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,705
MAKING ME
THINK I'M SICK,
EVEN WHEN I'M NOT.

59
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,165
AND I AM!

60
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,041
I'M ON
THE THRESHOLD
OF DEATH,

61
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,085
AND WHO IS
USHERING ME OUT?

62
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,254
A QUACK
AND A WHISPERING WOMAN

63
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,214
I'LL CALL TOMORROW.

64
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,467
DON'T BOTHER.
JUST COME OVER WITH
THE DEATH CERTIFICATE.

65
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,594
YOU CAN SIGN IT HERE.

66
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,012
OH, WALTER.

67
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,805
OH, STOP THOSE
CROCODILE TEARS.

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,349
SHE'D LOVE
TO SEE ME GONE,
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

69
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,102
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
MR. BEDEKER.

70
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,021
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.

71
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,647
OH--

72
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,857
THANK YOU.

73
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,196
DOCTOR.

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,781
DOCTOR, HOW
IS HE, REALLY?

75
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,950
MRS. BEDEKER,
YOUR HUSBAND IS ONE

76
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,994
OF THE HEALTHIEST
PATIENTS I HAVE.

77
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,289
(Ethel)
BUT HE'S SICK
MOST OF THE TIME.

78
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,459
WELL, I'LL CALL AGAIN,
MRS. BEDEKER.

79
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,296
IT WOULDN'T
BE A BAD IDEA

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,215
IF YOU TOOK A FEW
VITAM INS YOURSELF.

81
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,884
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE
RUN DOWN AND PALE.

82
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,512
(Walter)
ETHEL, THERE'S A DRAFT
IN HERE AND I FEEL
A COLD COMING ON!

83
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,891
YES, DEAR,
I'LL, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

84
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,396
ALL RIGHT, TAKE
A FEW OF THOSE.

85
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,357
I'M SURE YOU'LL
FEEL MUCH BETTER.

86
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,691
THANK YOU.

87
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,735
DON'T WORRY.
SEE YOU.

88
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,904
GOOD-BYE, DOCTOR.

89
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,990
[sighs]

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,167
(Walter)
FREEZING AIR BLASTING
INTO THE ROOM.

91
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,878
YOU KNOW HOW MANY
GERMS THERE ARE

92
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,506
IN A CUBIC FOOT
OF AIR, ETHEL?

93
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,675
(both)
8,900,000.

94
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,426
I KNOW YOU
WANT ME TO DIE.

95
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,470
THAT'S WHY YOU
LEAVE WINDOWS OPEN.

96
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,888
BUT, AS A POINT
OF DECENCY,

97
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,765
COULDN'T YOU DO
IT MORE SUBTLY?

98
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,351
THE DOCTOR SAID
IT WAS STUFFY.
YOU NEED FRESH AIR.

99
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,186
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT THERE?

100
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,440
I'M WELL,
BUT HE GIVES YOU
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ME.

101
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,025
HE SAYS I'M NOT SICK

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,986
BUT, WHILE I LIE
HERE HELPLESS,

103
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,906
HE TELLS YOU I'VE GOT
A LIFE EXPECTANCY
OF 20 M INUTES.

104
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,867
DON'T DENY IT, ETHEL.
I COULD SMELL THE COLLUSION.

105
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,537
IT WAS FOR VITAM INS,
WALTER, FOR ME.

106
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,872
VITAM INS FOR YOU?

107
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,417
HERE I LIE,

108
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,294
WITH MY LIFE
EBBING AWAY,

109
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,587
AND THAT QUACK
PRESCRIBES VITAM INS
FOR YOU.

110
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,799
SEE? I'M DYING,
BUT SHE GETS VITAM INS.

111
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,761
STOP, ETHEL.
GET OUT OF HERE.
LET ME DIE IN PEACE.

112
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,638
ALL RIGHT, WALTER.

113
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,223
WHAT?

114
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,059
I SIMPLY MEANT
THAT I'D LET YOU ALONE

115
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,645
SO YOU CAN TAKE A LITTLE NAP.

116
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,731
I CAN'T NAP.

117
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,192
WHY DOES A MAN HAVE TO DIE?

118
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,569
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

119
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,779
WHY DOES A MAN HAVE TO DIE?

120
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,990
THE WORLD GOES ON
FOR M ILLIONS OF YEARS,

121
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,908
AND HOW LONG
IS A MAN'S LIFE?

122
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,828
THIS MUCH. A DROP.
A M ICROSCOPIC FRAGMENT.

123
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,414
WHY CAN'T A MAN
LIVE 500 YEARS,

124
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,416
OR A THOUSAND?
WHY DOES HE
HAVE TO DIE

125
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,168
ALMOST THE MOMENT
HE'S BORN?

126
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,419
I DON'T KNOW, DEAR.

127
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,920
OF COURSE
YOU WOULDN'T.

128
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,839
GO ON. GET OUT
OF HERE, ETHEL.

129
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,136
MM.

130
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,429
[grumbling]

131
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,014
OH, IT'S A CRIME FOR A MAN

132
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,601
TO LIVE SUCH
A SHORT SPAN
OF YEARS.

133
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,978
WHY CAN'T A MAN LIVE
A DECENT NUMBER OF YEARS?

134
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,480
200? 300?

135
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,773
(male)
WHY NOT 500? 600?

136
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,358
YES. OR A THOUSAND?

137
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,485
WHAT A MISERABLE
THING TO CONTEMPLATE.

138
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,028
[eerie music]

139
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,905
A HANDFUL OF YEARS,
THEN AN ETERNITY

140
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,199
UNDER THE GROUND
IN A CASKET

141
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,658
IN THE COLD,
COLD GROUND.

142
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,993
WITH WORMS, YET.

143
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,787
YES, OF COURSE
WITH WORMS.

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,289
I SUBSCRIBE
TO YOUR VIEWS
WHOLLY, MR. BEDEKER.

145
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,707
I MEAN WHOLLY.

146
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,794
THAT'S M IGHTY DECENT OF YOU.

147
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,295
WHO ARE YOU?

148
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,172
CADWALLADER'S MY NAME.

149
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,051
AT LEAST IT'S THE NAME
I'M USING THIS MONTH.

150
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,220
IT HAS A NICE FEELING
ON THE TONGUE.

151
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,388
"CADWALLADER."

152
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,231
HOW'D YOU
GET IN HERE?

153
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,899
I'VE NEVER BEEN GONE.

154
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,484
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR SOME TIME.

155
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,319
I'LL MAKE IT BRIEF,
MR. BEDEKER.

156
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,987
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN

157
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,572
WITH A NOSE
FOR A BARGAIN,

158
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,574
SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE
YOU A PROPOSITION.

159
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,701
WE EACH HAVE SOMETHING
THE OTHER WANTS.

160
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,913
THAT SEEMS
A RELATIVELY SOLID
BASIS FOR A BARGAIN.

161
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,916
DOES IT?

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,501
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE

163
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,336
THAT COULD POSSIBLY
INTEREST ME?

164
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,672
A GREAT MANY THINGS.

165
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,924
OH, YOU'D
BE SURPRISED,
MR. BEDEKER.

166
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,136
MANY THINGS,
VARIED AND DELIGHTFUL.

167
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,595
AND WHAT DO I HAVE

168
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,556
THAT COULD REMOTELY
INTEREST YOU?

169
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,392
ACTUALLY, A M INOR ITEM.

170
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,145
IN FACT,
SOMETHING LESS THAN M INOR,

171
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,855
INSIGNIFICANT,

172
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,109
INFINITESIMAL, M ICROSCOPIC,
TEENSY-WEENSY.

173
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,194
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS?

174
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,698
WHAT'S IN A NAME,
MR. BEDEKER, REALLY?

175
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,075
IT'S A MERE QUESTION
OF SEMANTICS.

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,326
JUST LANGUAGE.

177
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,412
A MERE STRETCH OF WORDS.

178
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,663
FOR EXAMPLE,

179
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,123
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

180
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:43,336
YOU WANT AN EXTENDED
LIFE-SPAN.

181
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,547
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS
TO PLAY AROUND WITH.

182
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,383
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL
THAT IMMORTALITY.

183
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,720
BUT WHY MAKE IT
SOUND SO IMPOSING?

184
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,806
LET'S CALL IT--
JUST THE TWO OF US--

185
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,641
LET'S CALL IT

186
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,978
"SOME ADDITIONAL
FREE TIME."

187
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,980
AFTER ALL, WHAT ARE
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS

188
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,190
OR A FEW THOUSAND?

189
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,441
A FEW THOUSAND?

190
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,984
5,000, 1 0,000?

191
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,736
WHAT IS IT IN
THE SCHEME OF THINGS?

192
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,571
THE WORLD WILL GO ON
AD INFINITUM.

193
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,740
SO WHAT ARE A FEW
THOUSAND YEARS

194
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,783
MORE OR LESS,
GIVE OR TAKE,

195
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,160
ADD OR SUBTRACT?

196
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,578
AND THIS LITTLE ITEM

197
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,371
THAT YOU WANT
IN RETURN

198
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,666
WHAT DO WE
CALL THAT?

199
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,129
WELL, WHAT COULD
WE CALL THAT?

200
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,797
WE COULD CALL IT

201
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,299
UH,

202
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,760
A LITTLE PIECE
OF YOUR MAKEUP,

203
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,096
A CRUMB OFF THE CRUST
OF YOUR STRUCTURE

204
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,850
A FRAGMENT OF AN ATOM
OF YOUR BEING, OR,

205
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,394
OR WHAT?

206
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,938
A SOUL?

207
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,611
YOU'RE THE DEVIL.

208
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,112
AT YOUR SERVICE.

209
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,240
[mischievous music]

210
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,535
HOW ABOUT IT, MR. BEDEKER?
WHY NOT? A PARTNERSHIP
OF A SORT.

211
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,829
YOU DEED TO ME
YOUR SO-CALLED SOUL

212
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,624
AND, IN EXCHANGE,
I GIVE YOU IMMORTALITY.

213
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,709
AND THEN
INDESTRUCTIBILITY

214
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,628
COMPLETE
INDESTRUCTIBILITY.

215
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,630
NOTHING CAN HURT YOU.

216
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,298
NOTHING CAN HURT ME?

217
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,592
AND I LIVE FOREVER?

218
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,636
CERTAINLY. WHY
NOT FOREVER?

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,639
GOVERNMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS
MAY DISINTEGRATE,

220
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,474

00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,936
BUT WALTER BEDEKER

"WALTER BEDEKER

223
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,454
MR. CADWALLADER,
ABOUT MY SOUL,

224
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,039
YOU SAY I WON'T MISS IT?

225
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,500
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IT'S GONE.

226
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,793
NO TRICKS?

227
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,753
NO HIDDEN CLAUSES?

228
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,591
I'LL JUST LIVE
AS LONG AS I WANT
TO LIVE. IS THAT IT?

229
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,925
THAT IS IT.

230
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,677
THAT IS PRECISELY IT.

231
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,724
WHAT ABOUT MY APPEARANCE?

232
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,560
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
DO MUCH ABOUT THAT.

233
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,479
WHAT I MEAN IS, YOU SHOULD
LOOK PRACTICALLY THE SAME.

234
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,440
WELL, AFTER 500 YEARS

235
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,901
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK
LIKE A DRIED-UP OLD PRUNE.

236
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,197
OH, MR. BEDEKER,
YOU DRIVE A MEAN BARGAIN.

237
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,366
A MOST
DIFFICULT BARGAIN.

238
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,786
BUT I'LL SHOW YOU
I'M A COOPERATIVE CHAP.

239
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,747
I'LL THROW THIS
INTO THE DEAL.

240
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,791
WHATEVER AGING
TAKES PLACE
ON YOUR FEATURES

241
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,044
WILL BE MORE
OR LESS IMPERCEPTIBLE.

242
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,629
WELL, MR. CADWALLADER,

243
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,547
I THINK
WE'RE CLOSE
TO MAKING A DEAL.

244
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,051
YOU'LL NEVER
REGRET THIS, NOT
TO YOUR DYING DAY.

245
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,387
WHICH, BY RIGHTS,
SHOULD NOT BE FOR
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS YET.

IS ONE THING.

LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG.

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,824
WALTER.

348
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,701
WHAT?

349
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,995
WHAT IS THIS
ALL ABOUT?

350
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,705
WOULD YOUREALLY
LIKE TO KNOW?

351
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,123
YES!

352
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,541
I AM IMMORTAL.

353
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,710
I'M INDESTRUCTIBLE.

354
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,588
I HAVE MADE
A PACT WITH A MAN
NAMED CADWALLADER.

355
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,466
HE HAS GIVEN
ME IMMORTALITY
IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SOUL.

356
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,551
MORE SIMPLE
THAN THAT I
COULDN'T PUT IT.

357
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,719
I'LL CALL A DOCTOR.

358
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,220
YOU WILL NOT.

359
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,389
IF YOU HAD ANY
IMAGINATION AT ALL,

360
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,684
YOU'D FIND A WAY
FOR ME TO GET SOME
EXCITEMENT OUT OF ALL THIS.

361
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,312
I'VE BEEN
IN SUBWAY CRASHES,
BUS ACCIDENTS,

362
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,731
MAJOR FIRES,
I'VE EVEN DRUNK
POISON HERE.

363
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,399
NOTHING!

364
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,069
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK I'LL DO?

365
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,989
I THINK I'LL GO UP
ON THE ROOF AND JUMP
DOWN THE LIGHT WELL

366
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,493
STRAIGHT, SMACK,
DOWN THE LIGHT WELL,

367
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,495
1 4 STORIES, JUST
FOR THE EXCITEMENT.

368
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,580
WALTER, NO! PLEASE!

369
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,665
GO DROWN
IN THE TUB ETHEL!

370
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,750
WALTER, PLEASE!

371
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,168
LEAVE ME ALONE!

372
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,669
WALTER!

373
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,091
WALTER, PLEASE,
COME BACK TO
THE APARTMENT.

374
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,842
I'LL MAKE YOU
POTATO PANCAKES.

375
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,594
YOU USED TO LOVE
POTATO PANCAKES.

376
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,721
ETHEL, YOUARE
A POTATO PANCAKE.

377
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,849
YOU'RE AS TASTELESS
AS A POTATO PANCAKE.
NOW, LEAVE ME ALONE.

378
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,184
WALTER, NO!

379
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,644
ETHEL, GET OUT
OF MY WAY.

380
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,104
WALTER, PLEASE!

381
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,230
AH!

382
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,107
[screaming]

383
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,121
I WONDER WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

384
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,373
[mischievous music]

385
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,720
HELLO. OPERATOR?

386
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,223
WOULD YOU GET ME
THE POLICE, PLEASE?

387
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,226
HURRY. IT'S,
UH, AN EMERGENCY.

388
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,355
HELLO. POLICE STATION?

389
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,357
MY NAME IS WALTER BEDEKER.

390
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,277
I LIVE AT 1 1 TH
NORTH SEVENTH STREET.

391
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,570
THAT'S RIGHT.

392
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,321
APARTMENT 1 21 4.

393
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,117
COULD YOU COME OVER HERE
RIGHT AWAY, PLEASE?

394
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,077
NO, NO, NO.
NO TROUBLE.

395
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,079
I JUST KILLED MY WIFE.

396
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,455
HM.

397
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,875
OH, I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE.

398
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,877
GOOD-BYE.

399
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,753
[sighs]

400
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,716
NOW, LET'S GIVE
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
A LITTLE WHIRL.

401
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,720
WELL, COOPER
THE LEGAL BEAGLE.

402
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,138
HOW ARE YOU?

403
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,973
I'M MISERABLE,
MR. BEDEKER.

404
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,601
I'VE BEEN MISERABLE
EVER SINCE I TOOK
YOUR CASE.

405
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,352
I'VE HAD TOUGH
CLIENTS BEFORE,

406
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,645
BUT NOBODY LIKE YOU.

407
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,147
REALLY? WHAT DISTURBS YOU?

408
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,024
IN FIVE DAYS OF A TRIAL,

409
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,776
YOU'VE ACTED LIKE A MAN
DESPERATE TO GET CONVICTED.

410
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,447
WHEN I EXAM INE YOU,
YOU SHUT UP LIKE A CLAM.

411
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,656
IS THAT A FACT?

412
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,325
THAT IS A FACT.

413
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,453
NOW, TOMORROW, HERE'S
WHAT I WANT US TO DO.

414
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,664
COOPER, PUT IT AWAY.

415
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,291
HOW'S THAT?

416
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,501
PUT IT AWAY.

417
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,087
BEDEKER, DID YOU GET
WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU?

418
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,090
YOU ARE ABOUT 1 2 HOURS AWAY
FROM A "GUILTY" VERDICT

419
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,092
TO A CHARGE
OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

420
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,511
AND WHAT IS THE PENALTY?

421
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,139
THE PENALTY FOR
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER

422
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,808
IN THIS STATE IS DEATH
IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.

423
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,561
MR. COOPER, THE ONLY THING
THEY'LL GET FOR THEIR PAIN

424
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,146
IF THEY TRY TO BURN ME

425
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,358
IS A STAGGERING BILL
FOR ELECTRICITY.

426
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,612
GOOD-BYE, MR. COOPER.

427
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,406
BEDEKER.

428
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,700
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

429
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,704
MR. COOPER,
PLEASE DON'T BOTHER.

430
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,216
[judge pounding gavel]

431
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,218
MR. BEDEKER,
YOU'VE BEEN TRIED

432
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,221
AND FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

433
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,223
HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY

434
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,059
BEFORE THE COURT
PRONOUNCES SENTENCE UPON YOU?

435
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,228
NO, YOUR HONOR.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

436
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:16,190
THEN THE COURT SENTENCES YOU
TO IMPRISONMENT

437
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,485
IN THE STATE PENITENTIARY
WITHOUT HOPE OF PAROLE

438
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,404
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE.

439
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,905
I KNEW
WE COULD DO IT!

440
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,699
CONGRATULATIONS!

441
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,451
[people murmuring]

442
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,036
LIFE?

443
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,205
LIFE IMPRISONMENT?

444
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,091
IT'S YOUR
LAST MEAL
WITH US, BEDEKER.

445
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,634
THEY'LL BE
TAKING YOU

446
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,053
TO THE PENITENTIARY
TOMORROW MORNING.

447
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,889
THE PENITENTIARY
FOR LIFE.

448
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,725
THAT'S RIGHT.
FOR LIFE.

449
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,393
LOOK AT
IT PHILOSOPHICALLY.

450
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,229
WHAT'S LIFE?
40 YEARS, 45 YEARS?

451
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,190
YOU CAN DO
THAT STANDING
ON YOUR HEAD.

452
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,698
THA T'S ALL.
40, 45 YEARS.

453
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,117
MAYBE NOT EVEN

[lock clicks]

455
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,298
40, 45 YEARS.

456
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,593
(CadwaIIader)
AFTER ALL, WHAT'S
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS?

457
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,261
OR A FEW THOUSAND?

458
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,263
OR 5,000? OR 1 0,000?

459
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,767
WHAT IS IT
IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS?

ABOUT THAT ESCAPE CLAUSE,
YOU CARE TO UTILIZE IT NOW?

466

THAT'S A WISE MAN.

00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:17,353
ODD THING. YOU LOOK
LIKE A MAN HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

468
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,605
JUST LIKE A MAN
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

469

"EVERY MAN IS PUT ON EARTH
CONDEMNED TO DIE,

OF EXECUTION UNKNOWN."
