00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,756
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,467
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,262
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,265
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,643
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,271
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,315
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,318
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,071
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,075
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,752
[machinery clanking]

00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,924

THE BLASTING AREA WILL
BE CLEARED BY 0200.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,054
REPEAT. THE BLASTING
AREA WILL BE CLEARED
BY 0200.

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,897
IT'S AN ODD WAY
TO SPEND THE LAST
NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,441
ODD?

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,403
WELL, THE LAST NIGHT
ON EARTH YOU DON'T SPEN D
LOOKING AT YOUR TRANSPORTATION.

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,031
LAST NIGHT ON
EARTH, YOU SPEND
ENJOYING EARTH.

19
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:18,660
YOU WALK ITS STREETS,
GO IN ITS BARS, DANCE
WITH ITS WOM EN.

20
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,039
THAT'S GOING
TO BE OUR WORLD
FOR A LONG TIME, SAM.

21
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:27,795
AND YET WE STAND OUT HERE
WATCHING HER JUST THREE
HOURS BEFORE WE TAKE OFF.

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,131
MARCUSSON?

23
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,050
MM?

24
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,593
ARE YOU AFRAI D?

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,349
I DON'T THINK SO.
ARE YOU?

26
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,522
I AM.

27
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,690
VERY.

28
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,235
IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH YOU.

29
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,820
YOU'RE TRAINED FOR IT.

30
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,656
IT'S NOT THE
SAME WITH ME.

31
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,242
I'M A SCI ENTIST,
A B IOLOG IST.

32
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:03,831
MY WORLD IS ONE
OF BOOKS AND SLI DES
AND M ICROSCOPES.

33
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,918
I'M BEING SENT UP
THERE BECAUSE THEY
NEED MY MIND.

34
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,546
AND IT'S A P ITY
THEY CAN'T J UST
SEND THAT.

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,259
LEAVE THE BODY BACK HERE
WHERE IT BELONGS. J UST
SEND THE MIND.

36
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,345
OH, I AM FRIGHTEN ED.

37
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,390
I'M FRIGHTEN ED OF WHAT
WE'LL F IN D UP THERE.

38
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,518
WELL, THAT'S THE ONE
THING YOU SHOU LDN'T
BE FRIGHTEN ED OF.

THE U N KNOWN, SURE.
TH E-THE LON ELIN ESS,
THE S I LENCE.

40
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,400
THAT SHOULD
SCARE ANYBODY.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,278
BUT I'VE GOT
A PH I LOSOPHY
ABOUT PEOPLE.

42
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,405
I MEAN, ALL
PEOPLE, SAM.

43
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,782
THEY'RE THE
SAME ALL OVER.

44
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,869
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT WHEN GOD
MADE HUMAN BEINGS,

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,955
HE DEVELOPED THEM
FROM A F IXED FORM U LA.

46
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,957
THEY'D BE THE SAM E
HERE ON EARTH

47
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,877
AS IN THE FURTHEST
REACHES OF SPACE.

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,922
PEOPLE ON MARS?

49
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,301
WHEREVER THEY'RE ABLE
TO EXIST, THEY'D
BE THE SAM E.

00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,555

HEY, LET'S GET
READY, SAM. WE'VE ONLY
GOT A COUPLE OF HOURS.

55
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,616
THEY'RE TAKING
A HIGHWAY INTO SPACE.
MAN UNSHACKLING HIMSELF

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,245
AND SENDING HIS TINY,
GROPING FINGERS UP
INTO THE UNKNOWN.

57
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,831
THEIR DESTINATION IS MARS,

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,710
AND IN JUST A MOMENT
WE'LL LAND THERE WITH THEM.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

62
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,250
MARCUSSON, WHAT THE--

63
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,782

64
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,540
ANY LAN DING,
YOU CAN WALK
AWAY FROM, REMEMBER?

65
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,587
WHAT ABOUT THE SH I P?
[groans]

66
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,924
THE AIR PRESSURE
SEEMS TO BE HOLDING UP.
I GOT THE LIGHTS RU N NING.

67
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,927
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO CHECK ANYTHING ELSE.

68
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,847
YOU-YOU, UH,
REST FOR A WHILE.
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME.

69
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,100
PLENTY OF TIME?

70
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,812
ALL RIGHT.

71
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,772
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SEE.

SAM!

76
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,408
HEY.

77
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,326
HOW LONG DID I SLEEP?

78
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,413
OH, A COUPLE

[clanking]

84
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,084
YOU WON'T BE
ABLE TO OPEN IT.
THE HYDRAU LIC'S OUT.

85
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,587
PUT HER ON THE
AUXI LIARY, THEN.
WE CAN OPEN IT.

86
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,048
NO, WE CAN'T.

87
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,134
I'LL F IX IT.
I'LL PUT H ER
ON THE AUXI LIARY.

88
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,804
THEN WE CAN OPEN HER UP.
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO NOW.

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,224
I'LL OPEN HER UP.

00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,478
YOU HAVE TO
TAKE IT EASY.

YOU'RE A LIAR!
YOU CAN OPEN
THE DOOR.

95
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,321
WHY, SAM?
WHY WON'T YOU
OPEN THE DOOR?

96
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,325
I DON'T WANT
TO OPEN IT.

97
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,245
WHY NOT?

98
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,914
BECAUSE.

99
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,920
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE
ENQU I RING SCI ENTIF IC

100
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,839
I THOUGHT YOU

LOOK, I WANT OUT.
I WANT YOU TO OPEN

I'M BUSTED UP I NSIDE.

IF THERE'S
ANYBODY OUT THERE,
THEY'LL H ELP YOU.

114
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,182
AS LONG AS THEY'VE
GOT MINDS AND HEARTS,
THAT MEANS THEY'VE GOT SOU LS.

115
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,312
THAT MAKES THEM PEOPLE,
AND PEOPLE ARE ALIKE.

116
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,316
THEY'RE BOUND
TO BE ALIKE.

117
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,074
