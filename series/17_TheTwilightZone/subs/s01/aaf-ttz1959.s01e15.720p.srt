THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,259
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,970
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,639
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,643
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,104
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,315
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,651
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,779
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:36,160
IT IS AN AREA

THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

SHE REPRESENTS
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS

OF PLANNING, PREPARATION
AND TRAINING

20
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,643

THE MONITORS
WE HAVE GOING.

IF WE HAD 1 5,000

32
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,378
THE SITUATION
WOULD BE THE SAME.
WE LOST CONTACT.

33
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:13,590
SHE'S OFF

OFF THE RADAR SCREEN.

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,010
WHEN DID YOU
FIRST LOSE CONTACT?

36
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,846
LESS THAN
HALF HOUR AGO.

37
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,515
THERE WAS
A SHORT PERIOD
OF HEAVY INTERFERENCE.

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,225
NOW, THAT WAS
PROBABLY SOLAR.

39
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,103
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO IDENTIFY IT YET.

40
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,939
IN ANY CASE, WHEN
IT WAS OVER, THE
CONTACT WAS BROKEN.

00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,733
COULDN'T A CHANGE
IN THEIR COURSE
ACCOUNT FOR THAT?

42
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,402

WAS PRESET.

SO, AN AIRCRAFT

46
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,704
JUST DISAPPEARS
LIKE A PUFF OF SMOKE.

MAKES IT HARD TO THINK.

ALL THAT ENERGY,

80
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,885
YOU USE IT TO FIGURE
A WAY OUT OF HERE.

81

BEHIND TO PUSH.

99
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,885
IF HE'S THIRSTY,
WE GIVE HIM WATER.

100
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,638
IF HE'S HOT, WE MOVE
HIM INTO THE SHADE.

101
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,933
THEN IF HE
GOES, WE GIVE HIM
A PRAYER OR TWO.

IT'S HARDLY
ANY DIFFERENT

111
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,524
THAN WE KNEW IT
ON EARTH.

112
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,944
WHICH MEANS THAT
WHATEVER ASTEROID
WE'VE LANDED ON

113
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,363
IS IN THE SAME ORBIT
AS THE EARTH.

00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,950
WELL, WHEREVER WE
ARE, IT'S A CINCH
IT ISN'T HEAVEN.

00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,577
YOU CAN COUNT
ON THAT.

116
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,912
WE'VE GOT ONE THING
IN OUR FAVOR.

117
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,749
THE AIR IS PERFECT,
THERE'S NO RADIATION
COUNT TO SPEAK OF.

118
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,003
IT TOOK FOUR
AND A HALF YEARS
TO BUILD THAT SHIP.

119
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,547
THERE WASN'T
ANY PROTOTYPE,
JUST THE ONE SHIP.

120

THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND.

121
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,011
AND IT TOOK FOUR AND
A HALF YEARS TO BUILD HER.

122
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,846
SO, IF THEY KNOW
WHERE WE ARE

123
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,514
AND THEY WANT
TO COME AND GET US,

124
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,559
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BUILD ANOTHER SHIP.

125
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,541

00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,170

SAW SOMETHING,

AND THOSE SCRUBBY
MOUNTAINS OVER THERE.

130

THIS IS NO ASTEROID.
IT'S AN EIGHT BALL.

131
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,560
AND HOT, PEARSON,
HOT LIKE NOTHING
YOU'VE EVER FELT BEFORE.

132
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,271

IT'LL BE COOLER,

IS A NIGHT,

SOUTH TOWARDS

IT'S A BETTER SHAKE
THAN THOSE FOUR GOT.

ALIVE SO DON'T GIVE
HIM MY WATER!

IT'S A LONG WAY
FROM HOME.

147
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,379
FOR THE RECORD,
COREY, THERE'S JUST
THE THREE OF US NOW,

148
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,715
AND THE BIG
PROBLEM'S GONNA
BE TO STAY ALIVE,

149
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,508
I MEAN, THE
THREE OF US.

150
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,844

YOU FILCHING
JUST ONCE MORE--

151

I'LL KILL YOU!

THE SAME THING
GOES FOR YOU.

153
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,682
KNOCK IT OFF,
PEARSON.

154
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,017
BUT, COLONEL,
THIS GUY--

155
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,476
(CoIoneI)

156
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,234

GOING TO START

DOWN THE FLATS

160

DIRECTIONS.

161

IF THERE'S ANYTHING

162
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,002
IN THIS GOD
FORSAKEN PLACE THAT
CAN HELP KEEP US ALIVE.

00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,006

00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,422
WELL?

169
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,549
NOTHING, NOT
A THING.

170
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,008
[panting]

171
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,679
I MUST HAVE GONE
1 2 OR 1 5 M ILES.

172
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,641
ROCKS AND HILLS, THAT'S
ALL THERE WAS, JUST
ROCKS AND HILLS!

173
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,104
I THOUGHT MAYBE I
COULD GET SOME KIND
OF A FIX USING THE STARS.

174
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,149
BUT IT'S OVERCAST.

175
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,861
WHAT ABOUT PEARSON?

176
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,947
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT HIM?

177
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,782
YOU WERE WITH HIM.

178
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,868
HE WENT SOUTH
TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS.

179
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,788
I WENT WEST
TOWARDS-- I WENT
WEST TOWARDS NOTHING.

180
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,582
I TOLD YOU MEN
TO STAY TOGETHER.

181
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,805
COREY?

182
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,640
YEAH?

183
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,852
YOU DIDN'T SEE
PEARSON OR HEAR
HIM OR ANYTHING?

184
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,771
I ALREADY
TOLD YOU, COLONEL.

185
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,231
WE WENT
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

186
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,983
IT'S HOT
OUT THERE, HUH?

187
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,652
YOU KNOW IT.

188
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,197
IT MADE YOU
THIRSTY, HUH?

189
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,907
I'M GETTING
ACCUSTOMED TO IT.

190
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,158
OBVIOUSLY.

191
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,160
VERY ACCUSTOMED
TO IT!

192
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,871
SO ACCUSTOMED TO
IT THAT YOU DIDN'T
DRINK ANY WATER.

193
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,665
YOU WERE OUT
THERE 6 HOURS AND YOU
DIDN'T TOUCH A DROP!

194
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,793
PUT ME IN
FOR A MEDAL.

195
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,046
BUDDY, WHAT I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU CAN'T BE
PINNED ON A UNIFORM.

196
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,798
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU STARTED OUT

197
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,633
SIX HOURS AGO
WITH HALF A CANTEEN

198
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,344
AND THEN
CAME BACK WITH IT
THREE-QUARTERS FULL!

199
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,555
COME ON, COREY.
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOU LEFT PEARSON'S BODY

200
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,140
AND WHAT YOU
DID WITH HIM!

201
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,600
COME ON,
COREY, COME ON!

202
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,227
I FOUND HIM
FACE DOWN.

203
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,312
HE MUST HAVE
HIT HIS HEAD
ON A ROCK.

204
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,522
HE WAS DEAD.

205
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,856
WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN?

206
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,441
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN.

207
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,527
I HAD TO CHANGE
DIRECTIONS COMING BACK.

208
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,529
YOU BETTER
CHANGE YOUR STORY.

209
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,864
COLONEL, I SWEAR
TO YOU, I DIDN'T
TOUCH HIM.

210
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,741
I FOUND HIM--
HE WAS DEAD.

211
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,202
I SAW HIS CANTEEN.
I POURED HIS WATER
INTO M INE.

212
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,621
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

213
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,749
THAT'S WHY
I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

214
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,003
WE'RE GOING
TO BRING HIM BACK.

215
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,713
YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR M IND!

216
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,799
IT'S SEVEN OR
EIGHT M ILES OUT THERE!

217
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,387
I CAN'T MAKE IT
AGAIN! I'M DEAD!

218
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,598
CORRECTION, YOU'RE
NOT QUITE DEAD YET.

219
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,059
ALL RIGHT,
COREY, I WANT
TO CONDUCT A TOUR

220
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,561
TO PEARSON'S BODY.

221
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,437
I WANT TO SEE
FOR MYSELF. MOVE ON!

222
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,150
I CAN'T MAKE
IT, COLONEL.

223
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,612
I GOT TO REST.

224
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,803
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE OUT.

225
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,478
WELL, THIS IS
WHERE HE WAS.

226
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,773
I SWEAR, THIS
IS WHERE HE WAS.

227
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,567
WELL, HE'S
NOT HERE NOW.

228
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,195
LOOK, COLONEL,
HE MUST HAVE
CRAWLED AWAY.

229
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,321
YOU SAID
HE WAS DEAD.

230
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,739
I WAS WRONG.

231
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,366
WELL, I MUST
HAVE BEEN WRONG.

232
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,994
BUT YOU WERE SO SURE
HE WAS DEAD, COREY.

233
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,121
YOU WERE SO POSITIVE.

234
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,040
COREY, COREY,
DID YOU DO ANYTHING
FOR HIM AT ALL?

235
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,794
DID YOU CHECK HIM?
DID YOU DO ANYTHING
FOR HIM, COREY?

236
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,631
OR DID YOU JUST
STEAL HIS WATER
AND MAKE A BEELINE BACK?

237
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,968
I THOUGHT
HE WAS DEAD,

238
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,178
AND I WAS
SO THIRSTY.

239
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,222
MY TONGUE
WAS SWELLING UP.

240
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:01,310
I SWEAR MY TONGUE
WAS SWELLING UP!

241
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,438
PEARSON!

ANSWER ME!

246

PEARSON.

248
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,340
PEARSON?

249
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,260
PEARSON, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT, BOY.

250
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,095
HERE, WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE YOU HOME.

251
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,972
YOU'LL BE
ALL RIGHT.

252
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,894
WHAT, ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME
SOMETHING, PEARSON?

253
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,106
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO SAY?

254
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,566
WHAT?

255
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,651
YOU WENT UP
THERE, YOU--

256
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,112
(Colonel)
YOU SAW SOMETHING
UP HERE?

257
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,615
WHAT?

258
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,966
[solemn music]

259
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,470
(Colonel)
HE DREW THIS.

260
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,555
A SIGN OR,

261
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,141
OR A SYMBOL OR,
OR SOMETHING.

262
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,602
HE WAS TRYING TO
TELL US SOMETHING.

263
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,062
WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE HE--

264
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,683
COLONEL!

265
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,936
TWO MEN CAN LIVE
MAYBE FIVE DAYS.

266
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,437
ONE MAN
CAN LIVE TEN.

267
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,022
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.

268
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,733
YOU KILLED PEARSON,
DIDN'T YOU, COREY?

269
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,235
YOU KILLED HIM.

270
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,112
YOU'RE DEMENTED, COREY.

271
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,240
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR M IND.
YOU'VE ALREADY KILLED ONCE.

272
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,783
YOU ALREADY--
[gunshot]

273
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,135
I'M GENUINELY
SORRY, COLONEL.

274
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,054
I REALLY AM.

275
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,393
BUT YOU BROUGHT THE BOOK
TO THE WRONG PLACE.

276
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,978
YOU BROUGHT THE PROTOCOL,

277
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,480
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
AND THE NUMBERS.

278
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,567
AND NONE
OF THEM FIT HERE.

279
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,738
YOU KNOW, COLONEL,
THIS IS A JUNGLE

280
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,907
WHERE ONLY
THE TOUGH ANIMALS SURVIVE,

281
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,493
AND THEY DON'T DO IT
ACCORDING TO THE RULES.

282
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,579
YOU KNOW
YOUR TROUBLE, COLONEL?

283
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,457
YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR MORALITY
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

284
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,655
(male presenter, off)
NOW YOU MAKE
TRACKS, MR. COREY.

285
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,074
YOU MOVE OUT AND UP,

286
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:47,286
LIKE SOME KIND
OF GHOSTLY BILLY CLUB
WAS TAPPING AT YOUR ANKLES

287
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,539
AND TELLING YOU THAT
IT WAS LATER THAN YOU THINK.

288
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,291
YOU SCRABBLE UP ROCK HILLS

289
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,710
AND FEEL HOT SAND
UNDERNEATH YOUR FEET

290
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,506
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
TAKE A LOOK OVER
YOUR SHOULDER

291
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,009
AT A GIANT SUN SUSPENDED
IN A DEAD AND MOTIONLESS SKY

292
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,719
LIKE AN UNBLINKING EYE

293
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,846
THAT PROBES AT
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD

294
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,975
IN A PROLONGED ACCUSATION.

295
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,244
MR. COREY,
LAST REMAINING MEMBER

296
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,746
OF A DOOMED CREW,
KEEP MOVING.

297
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,581
MAKE TRACKS, MR. COREY.

298
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,501
PUSH UP AND PUSH OUT,
BECAUSE IF YOU STOP

299
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,921
IF YOU STOP, MAYBE SANITY
WILL GET YOU BY THE THROAT.

300
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,716
MAYBE REALIZATION
WILL PRY OPEN YOUR MIND

301
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,136
AND THE HORROR YOU LEFT DOWN
IN THE SAND WILL SEEP IN.

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,014
YEAH, MR. COREY, YEAH,
YOU BETTER KEEP MOVING.

303
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,351
THAT'S THE ORDER
OF THE MOMENT.
KEEP MOVING.

304
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:39,982
