00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,263
YOU POOR DUMMY.

177
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,057
YOU GOT A M ILLION
DOLLAR TALENT

178
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,726
AND YOU DRIBBLE IT
AWAY ON NICKELS
AND DIMES.

179
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:40,902
WANNA KNOW SOMETHING?

180
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,654
YOU GOT A
PARTNER NOW.

181
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,950
I DON'T
NEED A PARTNER.

182
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,828
I DON'T
NEED ANYTHING.

183
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,746
I'M CONTENT.

184
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:58,169
I... I HAVE THIS
TALENT, BUT I USE
IT SPARINGLY.

185
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,339
I MUST USE
IT SPARINGLY.

186
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,762
ON CLEANING FLUID
AND BUS TICKETS.

187
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,474
YOU GOT CHEAP
TASTE, PAPA, BUT
NOT YOUR PARTNER.

188
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,937
YOUR PARTNER DON'T
SATISFY SO EASY.

189
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:21,776
WHAT SATISFIES HIM?

190
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,863
WHAT SATISFIES HIM
COMES LONG AND LOW

191
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,781
AND DRIVES
ON FOUR WHEELS,

192
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,200
DRAPES NICE AND SMOOTH
AROUND THE SHOULDERS,

193
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,161
FITS EASY, COMES
FROM EXPENSIVE SHOPS--

194
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,872
LOOKS UPTOWN.

195
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,040
LUXURY, PAPA, LUXURY.

196
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,293
NOW, COME
ON, CONCENTRATE.

197
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,503
GO INTO A TRANCE
OR WHATEVER YOU DO

198
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,380
AND TELL ME WHAT
I NEED FOR TOMORROW.

199
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,841
WHAT'S FOR THE
NEXT DAY? WHAT'S
FOR WEDNESDAY?

200
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,845
COME ON, OLD
MAN, CONCENTRATE!

201
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,471
WHAT DO I NEED?

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,059
[musical burst]

203
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,481
A PEN?

204
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,985
WHAT IS IT, A
GAG OR SOMETHING?

205
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,821
A LEAKY PEN.

206
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,240
I'M SUPPOSED TO
NEED A LEAKY PEN,
IS THAT IT?

207
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,828
A PEN
THAT DRIPS
ALL OVER THE--

208
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,538
WAIT A MINUTE.

209
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,248
HEY, THIS
IS WILD.

210
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,417
THIS IS
REALLY WILD.

211
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,003
LOOK, IT DROPPED
RIGHT ALONGSIDE
OF A HORSE'S NAME.

212
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,797
"STAUNCH SOLDIER
RUNS IN THE FIRST
RACE TOMORROW."

213
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,261
HEY, OLD MAN,
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

214
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,389
THAT'S WHAT I
NEEDED ALL RIGHT--

215
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,351
A LEAKY
FOUNTAIN PEN.
SEE YOU LATER.

216
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,114
240 BUCKS.

217
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,868
YEAH, IT COULD'VE BEEN
A M ILLION, TWO M ILLION.

218
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,037
YEAH, AND
IT'S GONNA BE.

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,289
[knocking]

220
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,126
GOT IT?

221
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,628
THIS WHAT
YOU WANTED?

222
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,879
YOU GOT TOMORROW
MORNING'S PAPER?

223
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,464
THAT'S WHAT
SHE IS.

224
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,132
TOMORROW'S RACES
IN IT?

225
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,759
IT USUALLY DOES.

226
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,136
HERE IT IS.

227
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,805
YEAH?

228
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,391
DID YOU EVER
HEAR OF A TIP?

229
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,976
A TIP?

230
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,477
OH YEAH,
HERE'S A TIP.

231
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,814
DON'T PLAY
WITH MATCHES.

232
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,316
JERK.

233
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,487
THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO STOP AT
THE RACES EITHER.

234
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,449
IT COULD BE
FOOTBALL GAMES,
BASEBALL, BASKETBALL--

235
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,995
WHAT IS THIS?

236
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,423
WHY, THAT
OLD CRUM BUM.

237
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,091
I'LL FIX HIM.

238
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,010
I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF
HIS LOUSY OLD HIDE.

239
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,434
HE IS A
LITTLE CRUM BUM--
TO TRY THIS ON ME.

240
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,982
THANK YOU.

241
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,576
HEY, YOU.

242
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,161
HEY, PARTNER.

243
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,372
YOU, WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS.

244
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,042
PIDOTT, THAT'S
MY NAME.

245
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,878
WELL, PIDOTT,
YOU CAME A
CROPPER TONIGHT.

246
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,379
OH?

247
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,214
HOW IS THAT,
MR. RENARD?

248
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,800
THAT PEN,
IT DON'T WORK,
NO INK COMES OUT.

249
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,261
I CAN'T PICK
ANY WINNERS.

250
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,973
WELL, YOU
WANT A GREAT
DEAL, MR. RENARD.

251
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,393
THE THINGS YOU NEED,
YOU ONLY NEED ONCE.

252
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,228
JUST ONCE.

253
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,316
THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE EVER NEEDED.

254
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,818
OKAY. WHAT'S
NEXT, THEN?

255
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,154
NOTHING IS NEXT.

256
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,990
I'D RATHER NOT SELL
YOU ANYTHING MORE.

257
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,537
IS THAT A FACT?

258
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,082
PIDOTT, I WANT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT ME.

259
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,834
I WAS BORN UNDER
A LOUSY ZODIAC
OR SOMETHING.

260
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,087
I'VE BEEN
GETTING THE DIRTY
END OF THE STICK

261
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,755
EVER SINCE I WAS
FOUR YEARS OLD.

262
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,342
I FEEL
SORRY FOR YOU,
I REALLY DO.

263
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,385
I DON'T
WANT YOU TO.

264
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,763
I DON'T WANT
YOU TO GO TO THAT
KIND OF TROUBLE.

265
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,100
I JUST WANT YOU TO
KEEP SUPPLYING ME
WITH WHAT I NEED.

266
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,559
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT IS--

267
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,311
SCISSORS TO SAVE
MY LOUSY HIDE,

268
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,563
OR A LEAKY FOUNTAIN PEN
SO I CAN PICK WINNERS.

269
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,733
WHATEVER IT IS, I WANT
IT TO KEEP COM ING.

270
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,528
I DON'T WANT
IT TO STOP.

271
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,696
THAT'S A PITY.

272
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,074
BECAUSE IT
MUST STOP.

273
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,409
IT MUST STOP NOW.

274
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,123
WHO? WHY?

275
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,542
WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO STOP?

276
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,879
BECAUSE THE
THINGS YOU
NEED MOST,

277
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,714
I CAN'T SUPPLY.

278
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,051
W-W-WHAT ARE THEY?

279
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:02,056
SERENITY, PEACE
OF M IND, HUMOR--

280
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,061
THE ABILITY TO
LAUGH AT ONESELF.

281
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,439
THOSE ARE
THE THINGS
YOU NEED MOST.

282
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,570
BUT IT'S
BEYOND MY POWER
TO GIVE THEM TO YOU.

283
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,073
NOW, LOOK,
LOOK DEEP.

284
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,994
LOOK DEEP AND TELL ME
WHAT'S FOR TOMORROW.

285
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,997
YOU CAN SEE AHEAD,
I KNOW YOU CAN.
NOW, LOOK DEEP.

286
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,505
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

287
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,692
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, DON'T.

288
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,611
SHOES?

289
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,758
THESE SHOES
ARE TOO TIGHT.

290
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,554
THESE SHOES
ARE TOO TIGHT!

291
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,640
AND THEY GOT
LEATHER SOLES.

292
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,226
I HATE
LEATHER SOLES,
THEY'RE SLIPPERY.

293
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,062
BUT THEY'RE
WHAT I NEED,
AREN'T THEY?

294
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,316
YEAH, I PUT
'EM ON, THEN
I WALK SOMEPLACE.

295
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,026
IS THAT IT?

296
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,862
I WALK SOMEPLACE
WHERE I FIND
WHAT I NEED.

297
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,204
WHAT'S WITH IT,
OLD MAN?

298
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,580
WHAT HAPPENS?

299
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,998
I'M WAITING.

300
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,251
PATIENCE, THAT'S
ANOTHER THING

301
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,169
THAT YOU NEED,
MR. RENARD--

302
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,921
PATIENCE.

303
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,839
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, GIVING
ME THE BUSINESS?

304
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,384
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING-- GIVING ME
THE BUSINESS?

305
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,220
I CAN COME OVER
THERE AND TAKE YOU
APART BONE BY BONE.

306
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,229
COME ON, OLD
MAN, TELL ME.

307
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,939
ARE THESE
WHAT I NEED?

308
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,109
I DIDN'T
SAY THEY WERE.

309
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,112
BUT I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING--

310
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,531
THEY HAPPEN TO
BE WHAT I NEED.

311
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,642
MR. RENARD,

312
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,104
WHAT I SAW IN YOUR
EYES AT THAT BAR--

313
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,814
WAS DEATH--

314
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,317
MY DEATH.

315
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,779
YOU WERE
GOING TO
KILL ME.

316
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,409
SO WHAT
WAS NEEDED--

317
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:15,166
FOR MR. RENARD--
WAS SLIPPERY SHOES.

318
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,084
THAT'S WHAT
WAS NEEDED.

319
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,836
SLIPPERY SHOES.

320
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,599
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID ANYBODY
SEE IT?

321
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,100
DID YOU
SEE IT?

322
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,020
HIT AND RUN.
THAT'S WHAT
IT WAS.

323
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,440
COULD I SELL

324
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,027
