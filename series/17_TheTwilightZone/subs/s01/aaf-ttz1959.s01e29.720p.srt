THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,675
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,594
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,723
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,518
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,770
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,107
AND IT LIES
BETWEEN THE PIT
OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,860
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,529
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,491
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,730
WELL, HELLO THERE.

13
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,483

00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,748
NOT MUCH TO SAY,
IS THAT IT?

19
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,209
WELL, I'M
KIND OF AN EXPERT

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,591
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

24
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,885
YOU DO?

25
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,387
WELL, HOW ABOUT A CU P
OF HOT CHOCOLATE?

26
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,848
THAT'S THE FIRST
THING I USUALLY MAKE

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,600
WHEN I COME HOM E
FROM SCHOOL.

28
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,185
A CU P OF N ICE

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,568
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T.

33
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,779
I DON'T EITHER.

34
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,369
HERE WE ARE.

35
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,330
WE OUGHT TO
TELL YOUR MOTH ER
WHERE YOU ARE.

36
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,707
WE WOULDN'T
WANT HER TO
BE WORRI ED.

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,793
THAT WON'T
BE N ECESSARY.

00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,967

PUT THE M I LK ON.

MONTH OF NOVEMBER,
HOT CHOCOLATE

00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,815
AND A SMALL CAMEO
OF A CHILD'S FACE

42
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,901
IMPERFECT ONLY
IN ITS SOLEMNITY.

43
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,947
AND THESE ARE
THE IMPROBABLE INGREDIENTS
TO A HUMAN EMOTION.

44
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,074
AN EMOTION, SAY, LIKE FEAR.

45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,827
BUT IN A MOMENT,
THIS WOMAN, HELEN FOLEY,

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,246
WILL REALIZE FEAR.

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,916
SHE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE
THE PROPERTIES OF TERROR.

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,960
A LITTLE GIRL WILL
LEAD HER BY THE HAND

49
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,504
AND WALK WITH HER
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

50
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,517
THERE YOU ARE.

51
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
I HOPE IT
ISN'T TOO RICH.

52
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,198
NO, IT'S F IN E.
I'M GLAD IT
ISN'T TOO HOT.

53
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,950
I DON'T MUCH LIKE
VERY HOT THINGS.

54
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,869
I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

55
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,830
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,707

57
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,293

00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,506
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

61
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,594
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

62
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,309
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

63
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,939
A LOT OF THINGS
I DON'T RECALL

64
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,482
AT A CERTAIN AG E.

65
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,196
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO ME THEN.

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,867
I'M NOT SURE
EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

67
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,703
THERE ARE
SOME THINGS I'M
RATHER VAG U E ABOUT.

68
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,996
I KNOW THAT.

69
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,581
I KNOW THAT
VERY WELL.

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,166
I KNOW
ALL ABOUT YOU.

DON'T YOUREMEMBER?

72
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,884
YES, I REMEMBER
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

73
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,721
DO PEOPLE
LOOK FAMILIAR
TO YOU SOMETIMES?

74
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,390
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

75
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,227
I MEAN, WHEN YOU PASS
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

76
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,770
OR SEE THEM IN A BANK

77
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,355
OR THEY WALK BY YOU

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,609
DO THEY LOOK
FAM ILIAR TO YOU?

79
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,194
SOMETIMES.

80
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,283
TODAY?

81
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,826
YES, TODAY.

82
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,786
DID SOMEONE GO BY YOU TODAY

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,455
WHO LOOKED FAMILIAR?

84
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,667
NO.

85
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,421
REALLY?

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,800
IT'S NOT POLITE
TO CONTRADICT PEOPLE.

87
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,552
I TOLD YOU
THAT I DIDN'T.

88

OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL
WHEN YOU WERE CROSSING

92
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,908
THERE WAS A MAN
IN A CAR.

93
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,789
THERE WAS A MAN IN A CAR.

94
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,958
HE STOPPED FOR A RED LIGHT.

95
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,003

00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,265
WELL, H E--
HE LOOKED SO--

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,351
SO FAMILIAR TO YOU.

101

HE MADE YOU FRIGHTEN ED,

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

104
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,155
I KNOW HE LOOKS FAMILIAR

105
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:10,369
AND I KNOW HE FRIGHTENS ME
JUST LIKE HE FRIGHTENS YOU.

106
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,538
WHO ARE YOU?

107
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,957
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

108

THAT'S NOT
MY REAL NAME

111
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,887
BUT THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE CALL ME.

112
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,389

123
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,086
I DON'T THINK SO.

124
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,297

I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU

141
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,754

YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

147
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,861
I WAS STOPPED
FOR A RED LIGHT.

148
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,865
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AT ME
A LITTLE ODDLY.

149
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,660
DO YOU MIND

173
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,408
I SU FFERED
A KIND OF A SHOCK.

174
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,411
A TRAU MA,
THE DOCTORS CALLED IT.

175
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,540
AND AFTER

I MOVED TO CH ICAGO

176
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,584

00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,510
HE CHOKED HER.

349
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,888
THEN HE PICKED UP
SOMETHING HEAVY

350
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,723
AND HE HIT HER
ON THE HEAD.

351
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,141
THEN SHE FELL.

352
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,684
AND THEN
YOU SCREAMED.

353
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,519
AND THE MAN
LOOKED AT YOU.

354
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,229
THE MAN LOOKED
AT YOU.

355
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,441
THEN YOU SCREAMED
SO LOUD, HELEN.

356
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,443
YOU SCREAMED
SO LOUD.

357

00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,367
I WANT TO BRING YOU
U P TO DATE.

359
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,038

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,791
I WANT TO IMPART

COMING BACK TO YOU ANYWAY

363
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,381
AND I WANT TO BE
THE VERY FIRST.

364
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,009
THAT NIGHT, IT WAS ME
IN YOUR BEDROOM.

365
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,719
I KI LLED YOUR MOTH ER.

366
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,554
THERE WAS TROUBLE
WITH THE BOOKS.

367
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,765
I WAS PLEADING WITH
HER TO COVER FOR ME

368
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,267

00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,125
AND I HAD TO GET
OUT IN A HURRY.

375
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,419
IT WASN'T
UNTIL LATER
THAT I LEARNED

376
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,129
THAT YOU HAD
NO RECOLLECTION

377
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,631
OF WHO WAS

378
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,842
