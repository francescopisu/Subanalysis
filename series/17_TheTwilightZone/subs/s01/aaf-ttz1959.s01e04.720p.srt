THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION,

00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,217
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,429
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,306
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,810

00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,816

THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,610
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

THIS IS
THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,742
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,547
THAT'S THE WAY

WHAT DO YOU DO?

217
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,010
SHUT YOUR EYES,
SAY IT DOESN'T EXIST

218
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,762
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T SEE IT?

219
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,389
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO EXIST
IF I SHUT MY EYES.

220
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,100
IF I SHUT MY EYES,
IT ALL DISAPPEARS.

00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,146
IF I WISH HARD ENOUGH,
I CAN WISH IT

00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,672
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE PHONY.

231
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,926
IF I WISH HARD ENOUGH,
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE PHONY.

SHE JUST STAYS
IN THAT ROOM
ALL THE TIME,
