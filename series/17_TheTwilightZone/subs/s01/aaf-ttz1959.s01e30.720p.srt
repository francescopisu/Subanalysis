00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,965
(male narrator)
THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,551
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,554
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,473
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:20,060
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,438
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,610
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,155
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,366
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12

IN THE N EIGH BORHOOD
OF $3 M I LLION A YEAR!

49

YOU DON'T DELEGATE
