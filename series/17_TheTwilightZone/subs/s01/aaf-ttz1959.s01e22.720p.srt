00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,005
[eerie music]

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,465
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,759
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,846
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,765
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,436
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,688
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,858
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,861
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,447
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,617
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,342
MAPLE STREET, U.S.A.
LATE SUMMER.

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,889
A TREE-LINED LITTLE
WORLD OF FRONT-PORCH
GLIDERS, BARBECUES,

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,642
THE LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN,
AND THE BELL OF AN
ICE-CREAM VENDOR.

15
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,523
AT THE SOUND OF THE ROAR
AND THE FLASH OF LIGHT,

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,361
IT WILL BE PRECISELY
6:43 P.M. ON MAPLE STREET.

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,782
[strange whirring]

18
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,672
WHAT WAS THAT,
A METEOR?

19
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,508
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE.

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,927
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY
CRASH THOUGH, DID YOU?

21
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,388
NO, I DIDN'T
HEAR ANYTHING
EXCEPT A ROAR.

22
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,557
STEVE, WHAT WAS THAT?

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,685
I GU ESS IT WAS
A METEOR, HONEY. IT CAM E
AWFU L CLOSE, DIDN'T IT?

24
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,607
TOO CLOSE FOR MY MONEY.
MUCH TOO CLOSE.

25
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,740
(narrator)
THIS IS MAPLE STREET ON
A LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

26
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,370
MAPLE STREET
IN THE LAST CALM
AND REFLECTIVE MOMENT

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,039
BEFORE THE MONSTERS CAME.

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,152
OPERATOR. OPERATOR!

29
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,991
OPERATOR!

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,960
STEVE, THE POWER'S OFF.
I HAD THE SOUP ON
THE STOVE

31
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,920
AND THE STOVE J UST
STOPPED WORKING.

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,966
IS YOUR PHON E
ALL RIGHT? I CAN'T
GET ANYBODY ON M IN E.

33
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,011
(man)
OUR ELECTRICITY ISN'T
GOOD. IS THE POWER OFF?

34
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,764
(woman)
OUR RADIO'S GONE DEAD.

35
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,934
I'LL CUT ACROSS
THE BACKYARD.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,229
SEE IF THE POWER
IS STILL ON ON
FLORAL STREET.

37
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,319
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

38
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,323
WHY SHOU LD THE POWER
GO OFF ALL OF A SU DDEN
AND THE PHONE LIN E?

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,950
MAYBE SOME KIND OF
AN ELECTRICAL STORM
OR SOMETHING.

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,494
NOW, THAT DON'T
SEEM LIKELY.

41
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,831
THE SKY'S AS BLU E
AS ANYTHING. NOT A CLOU D,
NO LIGHTNING, NO TH U N DER.

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,833
HOW COULD IT
BE A STORM?

43
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,502
CAN'T GET A THING
ON THE RADIO. NOT
EVEN ON THE PORTABLE.

44
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,130
WHY DON'T WE GO
DOWNTOWN AND CHECK
WITH THE POLICE?

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,799
THEY'LL PROBABLY
THINK WE'RE CRAZY
OR SOMETHING.

46
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,969
A LITTLE POWER FAI LU RE AND
EVERYBODY GETS FLUSTERED
AND EVERYTHING.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,222
IT ISN'T JUST A POWER
FAILURE, CHARLIE.

48
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:47,226
IF IT WERE, WE'D STILL BE
ABLE TO GET A BROADCAST
ON THE PORTABLE.

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,812
I'LL TAKE A RU N DOWNTOWN.
MAYBE I CAN GET IT
STRAIG HTEN ED OUT.

50
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,781
[engine won't turn over]

51
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,427
I DON'T U N DERSTAND IT.
IT WAS WORKING F IN E BEFORE.

52
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,804
ARE YOU OUT OF GAS?

53
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,180
I JUST F I LLED IT UP.

54
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,015
WELL, WHAT
DOES IT MEAN?

55
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,935
IT'S AS I F
EVERYTHING STOPPED.

56
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,354
MAYBE WE'D BETTER
WALK DOWNTOWN.

57
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,106
WELL, LET'S BOTH
GO, CHARLIE.

58
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,691
YEAH.

59
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,280
MR. BRAN D,
YOU BETTER NOT.

60
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,739
WHY NOT?

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,742
THEY DON'T
WANT YOU TO.

62
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,536
WHO DOESN'T
WANT US TO?

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,122
TH EM.

64
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,623
TH EM?

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,417
WHO ARE THEM?

66
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,045
WHOEVER WAS IN THAT THING
THAT CAME BY OVERH EAD.

67
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,800
WHOEVER WAS IN THE THING
THAT CAME OVER. I DON'T THINK
THEY WANT US TO LEAVE HERE.

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,975
WHAT DO YOU
M EAN, TOM MY? WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

69
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,061
THEY DON'T WANT US TO
LEAVE. THAT'S WHY THEY
SHUT EVERYTHING OFF.

70
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,814
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT IDEA?

71
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,941
ISN'T THAT THE
CRAZI EST THING
YOU'VE HEARD?

72
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,652
IT'S ALWAYS THAT WAY
IN EVERY STORY I'VE
EVER READ

73
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,405
ABOUT A SH I P LAN DING
FROM OUTER SPACE.

74
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,825
FROM OUTER SPACE, YET?
SAL, YOU BETTER TAKE HIM
U PSTAIRS, PUT HIM TO BED.

75
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,162
HE'S BEEN READING TOO MANY
COM IC BOOKS OR SEEING
TOO MANY MOVIES.

76
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,123
TOM MY, YOU STOP
THAT KIND OF TALK.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

77
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,752
GO AHEAD, TOM MY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
AND THEN YOU'LL SEE.

78
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,464
IT WASN'T A SH I P.
IT WAS A METEOR
OR SOMETHING.

79
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,259
LIKELY AS NOT, THAT'S THE CAUSE
OF THE POWER FAI LU RE AND
ALL THE REST OF IT.

80
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,930
M ETEORS CAN DO
CRAZY THINGS LIKE,
LIKE SU N SPOTS.

81
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,184
SURE THAT'S
THE KIND OF THING,
LIKE SU N SPOTS.

82
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,437
THEY RAISE CAI N
WITH RADIO RECEPTION
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

83
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,108
THIS THING BEING SO CLOSE,
THERE'S NO TELLING THE
SORT OF STUFF IT CAN DO.

84
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,861
YOU GO AHEAD, STEVE.
YOU AND CHARLIE
GO INTO TOWN,

85
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,530
SEE IF THAT ISN'T
WHAT'S CAUSING IT ALL.

86
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,951
MR. BRAN D?

87
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,953
MR. BRAN D, PLEASE
DON'T LEAVE HERE.

88
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,873
YOU M IGHT NOT EVEN
BE ABLE TO GET
TO TOWN.

89
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,459
IT WAS THAT
WAY IN THE STORY.
NOBODY COULD LEAVE.

90
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,127
NOBODY EXCEPT--

91
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,962
EXCEPT WHO?

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,548
EXCEPT THE PEOPLE
THEY'D SENT DOWN
AHEAD OF THEM.

93
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:28,011
THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE
HUMANS. AND IT WASN'T
U NTI L THE SH I P LAN DED THAT--

94
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,473
TOM MY, PLEASE, SON.
HONEY, DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT.

95
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,060
IT'S THE CRAZI EST THING I'VE
EVER HEARD OF. THE KI D TELLS
A COM IC BOOK PLOT

96
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,062
AND WE STAND
HERE LISTENING.

97
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,314
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

98
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,566
GO AHEAD, TOM MY.
WHAT KIND OF A
STORY WAS IT?

99
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,069
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
THEY SENT AHEAD?

100
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,655
THAT WAS THE WAY
THEY PREPARED THINGS
FOR THE LAN DING.

101
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,075
THEY SENT FOUR PEOPLE.
A MOTHER AND A FATH ER
AND TWO KIDS

102
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,412
WHO LOOKED J UST
LIKE HUMANS, BUT
THEY WEREN'T.

103
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,680
WELL, I GU ESS WHAT WE NEED
TO DO IS RU N A CHECK OF
THE N EIGH BORHOOD

104
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,766
AND F IN D OUT WHICH ONES
OF US ARE REALLY HUMAN.

105
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,776
THERE'S NO USE
STANDING AROUND MAKING
BUM JOKES ABOUT IT.

106
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,782
WON DER IF FLORAL STREET'S
GOT THE SAME KIND
OF DEAL WE HAVE.

107
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,453
WHERE'S PETE VAN HORN?
HAS HE COME BACK, YET?

108
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,289
[car trying to start]

109
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,875
(woman)
DOES YOUR CAR
START, LES?

110
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,710
NO DICE.

111
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,588
[tries again]

112
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,094
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

113
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,971
NOTHING SEEMS
TO BE WORKING.

114
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,474
CAN'T EVEN GET
THE CAR STARTED.

115
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,310
[car engine starts]

116
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,401
CAR STARTED SOMEHOW.

117
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,069
HE GOT H IS
CAR STARTED.

118
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,248
HOW COME HIS CAR J UST
U P AND STARTED
LIKE THAT?

119
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,209
ALL BY ITSELF.

120
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,587
HE WASN'T ANYWHERE
N EAR IT. IT J UST
STARTED BY ITSELF.

121
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,760
HE NEVER DID COME OUT
TO LOOK AT THAT THING
THAT FLEW OVERH EAD.

122
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,845
HE WASN'T
EVEN INTERESTED.

123
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,972
HE ALWAYS WAS
AN ODDBALL.

124
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,809
HIM AND HIS WHOLE
FAM I LY. REAL ODDBALL.

125
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,562
NOW, WHY DIDN'T
HE COME OUT WITH
THE REST OF US TO LOOK?

126
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,856
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO ASK HIM?

127
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,361
(Brand)
WAIT A MINUTE.

128
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,279
WAIT A MINUTE!

129
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,157
NOW, LET'S
NOT BE A MOB.

130
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,625
I JUST DON'T
U N DERSTAND IT.

131
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,545
I TRI ED TO START IT.
IT WOULDN'T START.

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,797
YOU SAW ME.
ALL OF YOU SAW ME.

133
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,383
[engine cuts out]

134
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,518
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

135
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:26,231
I SWEAR I J UST
DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

136
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,569
WELL, MAYBE YOU BETTER
TELL US. THERE'S NOTHING
WORKING ON THIS STREET.

137
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,489
NOTHING. NO LIGHTS,
NO POWER, NO RADIO.

138
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,158
NOTHING EXCEPT
ONE CAR. YOURS.

139
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,077
HOW DO YOU F IG U RE
IT STARTED, LES?

140
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,079
HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THAT?

141
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,542
WAIT A MINUTE, NOW.
JUST KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.
ALL OF YOU.

142
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,919
OKAY, SO I'VE GOT A CAR
THAT STARTS BY ITSELF.

143
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,213
WELL, IT'S A FREAK
THING, I ADM IT IT.

144
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,591
WHAT'S IT MAKE ME, A
CRI M I NAL OR SOMETHING?

145
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,093
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT
STARTS, IT JUST DOES.

146
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,345
WHAT'S THIS ALL
ABOUT, STEVE?

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,556
WE'RE ON A
MONSTER KICK, LES.

148
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,393
SEEMS THE GEN ERAL
I M PRESS ION NOW HOLDS
THAT MAYBE THERE'S A FAM I LY

149
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,229
THAT ISN'T WHAT
WE THINK THEY ARE.

150
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:10,066
MONSTERS FROM OUTER
SPACE OR SOMETHING
DIFFERENT THAN US.

151
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,570
F I FTH COLU M N ISTS
FROM THE VAST BEYON D.

152
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:18,908
NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY THAT
MIGHT F IT THAT DESCRI PTION
AROUND HERE ON MAPLE STREET?

153
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,119
THIS IS A GAG
OR SOMETHING?

154
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,455
WHAT IS THIS?
A PRACTICAL JOKE
OR SOMETHING?

155
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,374
[car engine starts]

156
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,761
THAT'S SU PPOSED
TO I NCRI M I NATE ME, HUH?

157
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,306
THE CAR STARTS
AND STOPS AND THAT
REALLY DOES IT, HUH?

158
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,308
REALLY DOES IT?

159
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,519
WELL, I DON'T U N DERSTAND IT
ANY MORE THAN ANY OF YOU DO.

160
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,735
LOOK, YOU ALL KNOW ME.
WE'VE LIVED HERE FOR FIVE

00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,538
IT WAS THIS KI D WHO KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

316
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,957
HE WAS THE
ONE WHO KNEW.

317
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,459
HOW DID HE KNOW?
HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN?

318
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,211
(Man)
MAYBE TOMMY'S AN ALIEN.

319
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,297
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU PEOPLE?
NOW STOP!

320
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,632
(Woman)
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

321
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,051
[all yelling at once]

322
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,055
(man)
DON'T LET HIM
GET TO THE HOUSE.

323
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,474
(Woman)
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S HIM.

324
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,062
IT ISN'T THE KI D.
IT'S BOB WEAVER'S HOUSE.

325
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,275
IT ISN'T BOB WEAVER'S
PLACE. IT'S DON'S HOUSE.

326
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,568
IT'S THE WI LLIAMS' HOUSE.

327
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,902
IT'S THE KI D,
I TELL YOU.

328
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,446
IT'S CHARLIE,
HE'S THE ON E.

329
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,077
STOP!

330
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,125
[screaming]

331
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,793
IT'S STEVE!

332
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,170
STOP IT!

333
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,464
FOOLS!

334
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,425
[gunshots]

335
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,094
[screaming]

336
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,603
[gunshots]

337
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,357
[glass breaking]

338
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,653
(man)
UNDERSTAND THE
PROCEDURE NOW?

339
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,031
JUST STOP A FEW
OF THEIR MACHINES

340
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,493
AND RADIOS
AND TELEPHONES
AND LAWN MOWERS.

341
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,703
THROW THEM INTO
DARKNESS FOR A
FEW HOURS

342
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,998
AND THEN S IT BACK
AND WATCH THE PATTERN.

343
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,626
AND THIS PATTERN IS
ALWAYS THE SAME?

344
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,878
WITH FEW VARIATIONS.

345
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,173
THEY PICK THE MOST
DANG EROUS EN EMY
THEY CAN F IN D,

346
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,217
AND IT'S THEMSELVES.

347
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,720
ALL WE NEED DO IS
S IT BACK AND WATCH.

348
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,475
THEN I TAKE IT THIS PLACE,
THIS MAPLE STREET
IS NOT U N IQU E.

349
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,563
BY NO MEANS.
THEIR WORLD IS FU LL
OF MAPLE STREETS

350
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,651
AND WE'LL GO FROM ONE
TO THE OTHER AND LET
TH EM DESTROY THEMSELVES.

351
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,571
ONE TO THE OTH ER.
ONE TO THE OTH ER.

352
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,449
ONE TO THE OTH ER.

353
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,871
(narrator)
THE TOOLS OF CONQUEST
DO NOT NECESSARILY COME

354
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,333
WITH BOMBS
AND EXPLOSIONS
AND FALLOUT.

355
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,838
THERE ARE WEAPONS THAT
ARE SIMPLY THOUGHTS,
ATTITUDES, PREJUDICES,

356
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,091
TO BE FOUND ONLY
IN THE M INDS OF MEN.

357
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,845
FOR THE RECORD,
PREJUDICES CAN KILL

358
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,556
AND SUSPICION
CAN DESTROY.

359
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,434
AND A THOUGHTLESS,
FRIGHTENED SEARCH
FOR A SCAPEGOAT

360
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,936
HAS A FALLOUT
ALL OF ITS OWN

361
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,773
FOR THE CHILDREN AND
THE CHILDREN YET UNBORN.

362
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:08,195
AND THE PITY OF IT IS
THAT THESE THINGS
CANNOT BE CONFINED

363
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,949
TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

364
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,080
