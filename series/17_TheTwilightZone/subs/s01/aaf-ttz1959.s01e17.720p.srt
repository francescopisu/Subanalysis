1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:06,213
[eerie music]

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,465
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,135
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,054
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,974
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,811
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,980
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,150
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,236
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,822
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,035
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,199
WELL, MR. AND MRS. GIBBS.

13
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,034
OH, HELLO,
MR. HENSON.

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,036
IS YOUR ROOM COM FORTABLE?
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,289
OH, IT'S LOVELY.
IT'S JUST LOVELY.

16
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:26,293
YOU KNOW, YOU
MAKE US FEEL, YOU
MAKE US FEEL IMPORTANT.

17
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,670
YOU ARE IMPORTANT,
MRS. GIBBS.

18
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:33,717
AFTER ALL, IT ISN'T
EVERY DAY THAT WE ENTERTAIN
CELEBRATED CONTEST WINNERS.

19
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,596
NO, NOT EVERY DAY.
MAYBE EVERY OTHER DAY.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,475
I BROUGHT ALONG OUR HOTEL
PHOTOGRAPHER TO TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOU AND MR. GIBBS

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,979
FOR YOUR HOMETOWN PAPER.
NOW, IF YOU COULD JUST GET
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TOGETHER.

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,482
AND SMILE. SMILE.
OKAY, JOE. READY?

23
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,068
UH-HUH. HOLD IT.

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,070
OH, THIS IS
SO EXCITING.

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,572
THAT'S THE ELGIN
BUGLE, MR. HENSON.

26
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,407
HOW'S THAT?

27
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,327
THE ELGIN BUGLE. THAT'S
OUR HOMETOWN PAPER.

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,747
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
WELL, WE'LL SEND THEM
OUT A COPY RIGHT AWAY.

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,877
NOW, ENJOY YOURSELVES, FOLKS,
AND REMEMBER, YOU HAVE
UNLIMITED CREDIT.

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,093
(narrator)
MR. AND MRS. FRANKLIN GIBBS.

31
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:21,014
THREE DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS,
ALL EXPENSES PAID AT
A LAS VEGAS HOTEL.

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,518
WON BY VIRTUE
OF MRS. GIBBS'
KNACK WITH A PHRASE,

33
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,771
BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO EITHER
MR. OR MRS. GIBBS

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,274
IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S
A PRIZE IN THEIR PACKAGE

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,152
NEITHER EXPECTED
NOR BARGAINED FOR.

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,988
IN JUST A MOMENT, ONE
OF THEM WILL SUCCUMB
TO AN ILLNESS

37
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,657
WORSE THAN ANY
VIRUS CAN PRODUCE.

38
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:43,287
A MOST INOPERATIVE, DEADLY,
LIFE-SHATTERING AFFLICTION
KNOWN AS "THE FEVER."

39
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,139
[cheering]

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,938
NUMBER TEN.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,320
FRANKLIN, THERE IS SUCH
A FLAVOR TO THIS PLACE.

42
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,657
FLAVOR. THIS IS
THE KIND OF FLAVOR
I CAN DO WITHOUT, FLORA.

43
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,285
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL
HOW I FEEL ABOUT GAMBLING.

44
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,329
OH, THIS IS
DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

45
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,708
IT IS NEITHER
DIFFERENT NOR MORAL.
GAMBLING IS GAMBLING.

46
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,171
HOWEVER, THIS IS YOUR
VACATION, FLORA.
YOU WON IT.

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,175
BUT IN ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE,
I MUST REPEAT TO YOU WHAT
I'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG,

48
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,011
IT'S A MISERABLE,
TERRI BLE, WASTE OF TIME.

49
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,347
BUT, OF COURSE,
IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

50
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,100
OH, FRANKLIN, TRY
TO ENJOY IT, WON'T YOU?

51
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,894
[bells ringing]

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,236
I WON! I WON
THE JACKPOT!
I WON!

53
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,123
I WON. LOOK, I WON.
I WON, I WON, I WON.

54
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,542
LOOK, I WON. I WON.

55
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,795
ISN'T THAT MARVELOUS?

56
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,493
JUST WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

57
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,080
WELL, IT'S-IT'S ONLY
A NICKEL MACHINE.

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,667
ONLY A NICKLE MACHINE?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE
HANDFULS OF NICKLES

59
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,253
AND THROW THEM OUT
INTO THE STREET?

60
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,172
ALL RIGHT. WE GO
TO LAS VEGAS.

61
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,341
WE WASTE THREE DAYS
AND TWO NIGHTS.

62
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,678
WE DO IT BECAUSE THAT
IS YOUR SILLY IDEA OF
ENJOYING YOURSELF,

63
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,930
AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT
COSTING US ANYTHING.

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,809
BUT NOW YOU'RE SPENDING
MONEY. AND NOT EVEN
SPENDING IT, FLORA.

65
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,437
YOU'RE-YOU'RE J UST
THROWING IT AWAY!

66
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,689
WELL, THIS IS WHERE
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN.

67
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,608
IT'S QU ITE OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YOU ARE NOT
MATURE ENOUGH--

68
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,445
PLEASE. FRANKLIN, PLEASE,
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

69
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,656
I WON'T PLAY.
I PROMISE YOU.

70
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,746
FRANKLIN?
THE NICKEL'S
ALREADY IN.

71
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,585
ALL RIGHT.
THROW IT AWAY.

72
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,758
[coins clattering]

73
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,347
I'M NOT VERY
LUCKY, AM I?

74
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,640
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE ROOM, FLORA.

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,478
HERE YOU ARE, OLD BOY.
HERE, WAIT A MINUTE.

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,355
PLEASE!

77
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,648
WAIT, YOU TRY IT.
I'M ONE HOUR AND
30 MINUTES

78
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,318
ON THIS MISERABLE,
CRUMMY, MONEY-G RABBING--

79
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,320
PLEASE.

80
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,073
HOLD IT. HERE.
YOU PLAY. IT'S YOURS.
GO AHEAD, PLAY IT.

81
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,658
NO, REALLY,
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
I'M IN A HURRY.

82
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,204
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
PUT IT IN THERE, SEE?
AND PULL THE THING.

83
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,582
ALL RIGHT, SWEETI E,
I'M COMING. THAT'S THE
LITTLE WOMAN, YOU NOW.

84
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,252
LOTS, LOTS OF LUCK,
AND I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, HUH?

85
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,713
I'M COMING, HONEY.

86
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,725
(MAN)
PAY THE LADY
RIGHT HERE.

87
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,701
PAY THE LADY RIGHT HERE.
PAY THE LADY RIGHT HERE.

88
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,640
[coins clattering]

89
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,280
OH, FRANKLIN,
YOU ARE LUCKY!

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,159
IT WASN'T EVEN
MY DOLLAR. THAT--

91
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:37,080
THAT MAN GAVE IT TO ME.
HE MADE ME PUT IT
IN THE MACHINE.

92
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,125
WELL, NOW YOU'LL
SEE THE DIFFERENCE

93
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,335
BETWEEN A NORMAL,
MATURE THOUGHTFUL MAN

94
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,089
AND THESE-THESE WILD
I DIOTS AROUND HERE.

95
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,259
WE'LL-WE'LL PUT THIS IN OU R
ROOM AND WE'LL TAKE IT
HOME WITH US.

96
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,386
OF COURSE, DEAR.

97
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,556
YES, BUT NOT THESE
BABOONS AROUND HERE.
THEY'D THROW IT AWAY.

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,350
THEY'D COMPULSIVELY
PUT IT BACK IN
THE MACHINE.

99
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:02,314
BUT NOT THE GIBBS.
THE GIBBS KNOW THE
VALU E OF MONEY.

100
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:06,026
WELL, COME, MY DEAR.
I-I WANT TO SHAVE
BEFORE DIN N ER.

101
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,760
[metallic voice]
FRANKLIN.

102
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,559
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

103
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,561
WHAT?

104
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,230
DID YOU CALL MY NAME?

105
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,148
WHY, NO, DEAR.

106
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,486
I THOUGHT I HEARD--

107
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,402
[metallic voice]
FRANKLIN.

108
00:09:39,704 --> 00:10:01,433
FRANKLIN.

109
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,430
FRANKLIN, IS
SOMETHING THE MATTER?

110
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,432
NO, NO.

111
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,643
NOTHING IS THE MATTER.

112
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,313
NOTHING, EXCEPT
THAT-THAT--

113
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,316
THIS IS NOT
THE KIND OF MONEY
I LIKE TO KEEP, FLORA.

114
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,945
THIS IS-IS TAINTED.
THIS IS HIGHLY IMMORAL.

115
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,990
NO GOOD CAN COME
FROM MONEY WON LIKE THIS.

116
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,493
I'M-I'M GOING
BACK IN THERE

117
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:06,122
AND FEED IT BACK INTO
THE MACHINE, FLORA,
AND GET RID OF IT.

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,209
OH, FRANKLIN,
DO YOUREALLY
THINK THAT--

119
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,294
OF COURSE.

120
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,009
IF THERE'S ONE THING I
KNOW, FLORA, IT'S MORALITY.

121
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:23,181
AND I WILL NOT HAVE
THIS TAINTED MONEY
SMELLING UP OUR POCKETS.

122
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,852
I'M GOING BACK IN THERE
AND I'M-I'M JUST GOING
TO GET RID OF IT.

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,356
SO, YOU GO BACK
TO SLEEP, FLORA.

124
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,564
FRANKLIN, IT'S
TERRIBLY LATE.

125
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,275
I KNOW IT'S
LATE, FLORA!

126
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,418
LOOK, YOU STAY
RIGHT HERE, FLORA.

127
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,671
AND DON'T LET ANYONE
ELSE USE THIS MACHINE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

128
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,417
FRANKLIN, THAT'S THE
THIRD TIME YOU'VE
CASHED A CHECK.

129
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,085
I KNOW THAT.

130
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,463
WELL, YOU'VE SPENT
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

131
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,381
I KNOW THAT, TOO.

132
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,304
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
OUGHT TO STOP NOW?

133
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,641
HOW CAN I STOP?
I'VE LOST A GREAT
DEAL OF MONEY.

134
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,143
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
I'VE GOT TO WIN IT BACK.

135
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,437
BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T
WIN IT BACK, FRANKLIN?

136
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,856
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
HERE NEARLY THREE HOURS.

137
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,983
YES, I KNOW THAT, TOO.

138
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,489
FRANKLIN? DEAR.

139
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,785
YOU KNOW HOW AWFU L YOU FEEL
IN THE MORNING AFTER YOU'VE
BEEN UP TOO LATE AT NIGHT.

140
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,205
FLORA, WILL YOU KINDLY
SHUT YOUR MOUTH?

141
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,042
I HATE A SHREW, FLORA!
I HATE A WOMAN WHO STANDS
IN BACK OF YOU

142
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,628
AND SEES TO IT THAT
YOU HAVE MISERABLE LUCK!

143
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,131
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO ME NOW. YOU'RE GIVING
ME MISERABLE LUCK!

144
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,634
NOW PLEASE GO AWAY
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

145
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,136
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PEOPLE ARE LISTENING.

146
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,721
THE DEVIL WITH PEOPLE!

147
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,473
I'M NOT CONCERN ED
WITH PEOPLE.

148
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,561
I'M--I'M CONCERN ED
WITH THIS-THIS MACHINE.

149
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,897
IT'S IN HUMAN THE WAY
IT LETS YOU WIN A LITTLE

150
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,900
AND THEN, AND THEN
TAKES IT ALL BACK.

151
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,528
IT TEASES YOU.

152
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,990
IT-IT HOLDS OUT PROMISES
AN D-AND WHEEDLES YOU.

153
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,868
IT SUCKS YOU
IN AND THEN--

154
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,181
FRANKLIN.

155
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,975
FLORA, GO AWAY!

156
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,609
FIVE HOURS.
THAT'S HOW LONG
HE'S BEEN THERE.

157
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,695
WHEN THEY GET HOOKED,
THEY REALLY GET HOOKED,
DON'T THEY?

158
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,864
YEAH.

159
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,014
SOMEBODY

160
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,975
GET ME

161
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,686
A DRINK OF WATER, PLEASE.

162
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,853
FRANKLIN.

163
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,272
HM?

164
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,609
OH. OH, FLORA,

00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,883
YOU-YOU JUST HAVE TO STICK

IT WAS READY
TO PAY OFF.

204
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,138
AND IT DELIBERATELY
BROKE DOWN SO IT
WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

205
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:49,145
IT--IT'S NOT EVEN
A MACHINE, FLORA.

206
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,064
IT'S AN ENTITY.

207
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,319
IT'S A THING WITH A MIND
AND A WILL OF ITS OWN.

208
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,073
IT DELIBERATELY
BROKE DOWN.

BROKE DOWN!

00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,747
THAT--THAT THING!

211
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,249
THAT MONSTER!
THAT THIEF!

212
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,002
IT--

213
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,255
IT TOOK MY LAST
SILVER DOLLAR, FLORA.

214
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,760
IT STOLE MY LAST
SILVER DOLLAR
AND BROKE DOWN!

00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,075
IT'S-IT'S CHASING ME.
IT'S FOLLOWING ME.

225
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,495
IT'S TRYING
TO GET ME, FLORA!

226
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,499
WHAT IS? WHAT?

227
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,587
THERE'S NOTHING THERE!
