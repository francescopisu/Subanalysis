1
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,979
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,116
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,367
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,869
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:21,738
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,623
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,881
This is one of
the out-of-the-way places-

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,750
the unvisited places-

9
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,635
bleak, wasted, dying.

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,389
This is a farmhouse-
handmade, crude,

11
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,509
a house without
electricity or gas.

12
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,645
A house untouched by progress.

13
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,399
This is the woman
who lives in the house.

14
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,901
A woman who's been
alone for many years.

15
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,770
A strong, simple woman,

16
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,272
whose only problem
up until this moment

17
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,775
has been that of acquiring
enough food to eat.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,660
A woman about
to face terror

19
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03,163
which is, even now,
coming at her from...

20
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,282
the twilight zone.

21
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,123
Central control.

22
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,009
Come in, central control.

23
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:08,260
Do you read me?

24
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,128
Gresham is dead.

25
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,014
Repeat, gresham is dead.

26
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,882
The ship's destroyed.

27
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,385
Incredible race of giants here.

28
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,270
Race of giants.

29
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:19,521
No, central control.

30
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:21,390
No counterattack.

31
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,892
Repeat, no counterattack.

32
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,143
Too much for us.

33
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,029
Too powerful.

34
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,280
Stay away.

35
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:33,285
Gresham and i,
we're finished... finished.

36
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,656
Stay away...

37
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,099
these are the invaders-

38
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:40,218
the tiny beings from
the tiny place called earth

39
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,355
who would take the giant step
across the sky

40
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,857
to the question marks
that sparkle and beckon

41
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:49,611
from the vastness of a universe
only to be imagined.

42
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,480
The invaders who found out

43
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,982
that a one-way ticket
to the stars beyond

44
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,867
has the ultimate price tag,

45
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,987
and we have just seen it
entered in a ledger

46
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,124
that covers all the
transactions of the universe-

47
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,626
a bill stamped "paid in full"-

48
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:07,129
and to be found, unfiled,

49
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:08,997
in the twilight zone.

50
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,054
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

51
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,923
will tell you
about next week's story

52
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:22,043
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

53
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,595
And now, mr. Serling.

54
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,480
Next week, on this very spot,

55
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:28,600
there commences a very kooky
chain of occurrences.

56
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,485
The story has to do
with a young bank clerk who,

57
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,988
for some unexplained
and most uncanny reason,

58
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:35,490
finds himself able
to read other people's minds,

59
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,359
and then finds that
the power can get him

60
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,861
into a peck of trouble
and a bushel of travail.

61
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,364
Our show is called
"a penny for your thoughts,"

62
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,249
and it will be here
waiting for you next week

63
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,117
onthe twilight zone.
