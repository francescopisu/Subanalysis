1
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,000
Come out!
You can’t run anymore!

2
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,940
We’ll shoot!

3
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,800
Give up already, Abdul Hakim!

4
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,280
So ya wanna fight, huh?

5
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,830
You’re such a…

6
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
STRAY DOG STRUT

7
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,360
<i>Amigo!</i>

8
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,870
<i>How’re all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

9
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>It’s time for BIG SHOT, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,280
<i>Well, well, first up for today,</i>
<i>is this guy: Abdul Hakim.</i>

11
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,580
<i>He’s known as a serial pet thief.</i>

12
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>This time, he snagged</i>
<i>a test animal…</i>

13
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,620
<i>…from a research facility,</i>
<i>and is on the loose.</i>

14
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,290
<i>The good news is that he’s</i>
<i>worth a whopping 8 million!</i>

15
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,090
<i>The conditions are as always.</i>

16
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,690
<i>Bring him in alive to</i>
<i>collect your reward.</i>

17
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,760
<i>If you kill him,</i>
<i>kiss your reward good-bye.</i>

18
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,130
<i>He’s the biggest we’ve had in a while.</i>
<i>Do your best to get this guy</i>

19
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,330
How’s it look?

20
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,230
It’s done for.

21
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,070
Man, why does everything?

22
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,370
<i>Hey.</i>

23
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,440
Doctor? You got information?

24
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,740
<i>About Abdul Hakim.</i>

25
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,210
<i>—I’ll take it!</i>
—I’ll give a discount. 300.

26
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,150
I got his post-plastic surgery picture.

27
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,050
<i>Too much. 20 down.</i>

28
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,450
All right, 280.
On one condition.

29
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,920
What’s that?

30
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,820
<i>Sock him one.</i>

31
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,320
<i>He trampled over me.</i>
<i>If you want, punch him a dozen times.</i>

32
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,120
I’ve got the goods.

33
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,920
This one should be something big…

34
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah, see you in six hours.

35
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,170
<i>He had a very conspicuous suitcase.</i>

36
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,500
That info’s included
in the deal, right?

37
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,340
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,110
<i>It was something that could</i>
<i>carry a small woman inside.</i>

39
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,210
Treasure?

40
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,040
<i>Can’t really say,</i>

41
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
<i>The way he handled it</i>
<i>sure didn’t seem that way,</i>

42
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,060
Ni-lai-la!

43
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,730
If you feel lethargic,
have some ginseng hei-sui.

44
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,660
You’ll last a week with it!

45
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,500
If you’re tired,
have sugarcane hei-sui.

46
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,400
You ate too much?
Then have pineapple hei-sui.

47
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,940
Gimme some lao-chu.

48
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,300
Thank you.

49
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,790
Here you go.

50
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,710
Sorry. My apologies, bro.

51
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,080
Hey, I said I’m sorry!

52
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,670
What, can’t say anything?

53
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,650
Wh— What? Ya pickin’ a fight?

54
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,120
My treat.

55
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,430
Drink.

56
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,020
And now, the loot.

57
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,150
Even if I overhaul this whole craft,
I’ll have some change!

58
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Guess I’ll go eat Peking Duck with it.

59
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,260
As they say, “Don’t count
chickens before they hatch.”

60
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,690
I got this one nailed shut!

61
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,430
<i>Well, give it what you got.</i>

62
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
So all three went down?

63
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,600
Seems that way.

64
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,340
And Hakim is around here?

65
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,880
Seems that way.

66
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,670
Dammit, he doesn’t even know how
much that thing is REALLY worth.

67
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,490
A pet shop?

68
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,390
A shady one at that.

69
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Hey, bro, you can buy
anything here on Mars.

70
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,500
From guns to human lives.

71
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
If ya wanna know,
show me what ya got.

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,600
The chain on this one is long.
Must be the “Way of the Dragon” model.

73
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,070
Oh, you can tell?
That’s a rare one from the ’30s!

74
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,500
It sure is an antique.

75
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,420
Try the store called Animal
Treasure off of Caiphon Road.

76
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,540
I’m sure you’ll find something there.

77
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,620
Okay, I’ll look… but I’ll decide if I
want to buy it from you after I see it.

78
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,860
Oh, all right.

79
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,670
Run out of funds changing your
face around too much, Hakim?

80
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,380
W-Wait a sec…

81
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,850
Hey, don’t move.

82
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,690
You sure are restless, changing
your face around this much.

83
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,520
What the?

84
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,090
Hold it. I don’t want any
of this business here.

85
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,230
All of my babies are very sensitive!

86
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,030
You open it.

87
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,660
Why do I?!

88
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,130
There seems to be some
sort of misunderstanding…

89
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,500
Hurry it up!

90
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,500
Oh, fine.

91
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,490
A dog?

92
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,920
A Welsh Corgi.
It’s cute, but it’s everywhere.

93
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,260
Not a particularly rare species.

94
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,660
And how much is it worth?

95
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,170
With the suitcase, about this much.

96
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,130
200K?

97
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,320
No, no, 200, 200!

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
No way!

99
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,170
You don’t like it, you take care
of it yourself. Like eating it.

100
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,790
It is a puppy…

101
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,670
Sorry to bother you. Please continue.

102
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,950
I guess the Peking Duck
has been overcooked.

103
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,120
At least give me 300…

104
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,260
No can do.

105
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,120
280?

106
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,660
A no is a no.

107
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,560
250!

108
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,360
ZERO. I’ll take it back.

109
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,660
This again?
What is it this time?

110
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,570
Someone! Catch my babies! Hurry!

111
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,010
—There it is!
—All right!

112
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,050
Hakim?!
God dammit, what’s going on?!

113
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,700
—Gangway!
—What the hell?

114
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,360
WAIT, dammit!

115
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,260
Hey, what the hell do you want?!

116
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,320
Bounty hunter?

117
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,410
Animal rights syndicate?

118
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,320
Your story brings a tear to my eye.

119
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,150
Risking your life on a dog
that’s only worth 200 woolongs.

120
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,360
What?

121
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,990
What I want are the 8 million woolongs
hanging from your neck.

122
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,170
Not bad.

123
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
What?!

124
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,840
Dammit!

125
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,800
Shuddup!
I’m in a rotten mood right now!

126
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,980
There, there.
Here, lemme put on a collar.

127
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,690
A dog instead of a duck, huh?

128
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,790
Forget about that!
You know anything about it?

129
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,800
Yeah. This is a Welsh Corgi.
A total mongrel.

130
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Totally?

131
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,070
Totally. Completely worthless.

132
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,900
Shit, this gives me a headache.

133
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,230
And all this is
because of this mongrel…

134
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,080
The dog is worthless,
but the owner is worth something.

135
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Well, at least you should get
to know this critter well.

136
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Man, I hate kids and critters!

137
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,250
They’re nothing but trouble!

138
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,920
I got something!

139
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,620
All right!

140
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,450
It’s big!

141
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,130
Here it comes!

142
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,990
Pull on the line!

143
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,090
What time is it now?

144
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,640
I-I-It’s 4 o’clock now.

145
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,940
Two hours…

146
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,280
Who was that with Hakim? His ally?

147
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,410
Seems that way.

148
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,650
We got no clues?
We have to do something.

149
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,420
If that falls into police hands,
we’re in deep shit.

150
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,820
Seems that way.

151
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,330
All our work will be worthless if our
experiments get revealed to the public.

152
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,460
Seems that way.

153
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,550
How much does he think we
put into that “data dog”?

154
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Why don’t YOU do this?

155
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,300
Didn’t your grandma teach you
to finish what you start?

156
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,870
She was dead before I was born.

157
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,870
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>Anyway, we have the joker in our hand.</i>

158
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,610
Just do what we planned.

159
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,180
Give me code name “snoop.”

160
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,780
Yeah. It’s me.
I had some trouble.

161
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,860
No big deal…

162
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,350
Hey, wait, Michael!

163
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,200
I want to postpone the meeting a bit.

164
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,400
As I said, it wasn’t that big a deal…

165
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,630
Impossible? Why? Hey, wait!

166
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,640
And this is our plan?

167
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,580
Hey, you!

168
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,060
You have something you
want to know, right?

169
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,490
Wait!

170
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,390
My little Peeko can
answer your questions!

171
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,860
You have something you
want to know, right?

172
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,530
See, little Peeko is telling me…

173
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,790
…that you’re looking
for someone or something.

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,260
Well, where there’s
this dog, there’s Hakim.

175
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,230
Seeing loud and clear.

176
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,700
We’re counting on you, pooch.

177
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,050
We must resort to the dog whistle.

178
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,320
But that’ll cause a big mess.

179
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,350
I don’t care.

180
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,660
We’ll draw attention to ourselves!

181
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,460
We have no choice!

182
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,450
Shall I?

183
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,490
Do it.

184
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,710
I can’t hear anything.

185
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,040
I said before that
humans can’t hear it.

186
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,250
Oh, that’s right.

187
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,750
This is so farfetched…

188
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,020
Will this really attract?

189
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,510
Oh, it’s moving.
Something is now on the move.

190
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,980
Wait! Babies, what’s
wrong with you guys?!

191
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,880
Hey, wait!

192
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,230
It got away, Jet!

193
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,100
Huh? Hakim?

194
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,950
<i>No, the dog!</i>

195
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,640
It’s close, it’s close!
What you are looking for is nearby.

196
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,720
In fact, right in
front of your eyes…

197
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,730
Hey, wait, you need to pay!

198
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,800
I’ll pay when I am rich!

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,760
You can’t be serious…

200
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,340
Goddammit, what the hell is going on?!

201
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
Happy?

202
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,580
Yes, very.

203
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,080
—Excuse me…
—Outta my way!

204
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,720
You, what are you doing?

205
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,490
Hakim!

206
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,320
Dammit!

207
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,330
It’s just a dog, after all.

208
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,010
Hakim!

209
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,580
<i>Spike, he’s headed for Interstate 6.</i>

210
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,860
<i>Great!</i>

211
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,890
<i>If he thinks he can outrun me,</i>
<i>he’s welcome to try.</i>

212
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,860
Don’t get too hotheaded!

213
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,760
What part of me is hotheaded?!

214
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,060
There he is!

215
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,330
This is payback from earlier!

216
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,070
…the hell are you doin’?!
This guy is mine!

217
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,410
What the?

218
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,270
Now!

219
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,800
Stop that!

220
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,940
Shit!

221
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,440
Shit!

222
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,600
This is why I hate critters!

223
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,880
<i>Amigo!</i>

224
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,250
<i>How’re all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

225
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,150
<i>It’s time for Big Shot, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

226
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,850
<i>So, you remember Abdul Hakim</i>
<i>who chose a rather…</i>

227
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,760
<i>…flashy way of turning</i>
<i>himself in last week?</i>

228
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,490
<i>Yeah! Of course!</i>

229
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,860
<i>Apparently, he stole what’s</i>
<i>called a “data dog”…</i>

230
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,740
<i>…created in an illegal</i>
<i>experiment of some research firm.</i>

231
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,500
<i>Wow! What’s that?</i>

232
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,580
<i>I’m not sure myself, but apparently,</i>
<i>it’s a very intelligent pooch.</i>

233
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,450
<i>I hear that it’s</i>
<i>priceless among collectors.</i>

234
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,120
<i>That’s a surprise!</i>
<i>I wanna have a dog like that!</i>

235
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,790
<i>But they say it’s still missing.</i>

236
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,890
<i>I wonder where it went?</i>

237
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,620
<i>Really</i>
<i>But now, a commercial!</i>

238
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,620
Can’t be…

239
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,070
Hey there! When you’re done cleaning,
feed the komodo dragons!

240
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,770
I want you to work your ass off!

241
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah…

242
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,410
Hey, hey!

243
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,940
Hey, don’t jump on there!

244
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,680
That’s cold!

245
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,590
That’s why I said we should
throw out mongrels like this one!

246
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,350
But you’re the one
that brought it here!

247
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,380
In any case, we have to do
something about the ticks.

248
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,020
Shit…

249
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,970
I’m gonna salt you
and eat you, dammit!

250
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,170
<i>Well, it’s time for us to go.</i>
<i>See you next time!</i>

251
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,100
<i>Good luck!!</i>

252
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,970
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

253
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:58,310
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

254
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,010
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

255
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:10,750
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

256
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:20,000
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

257
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,010
The real folk blues.

258
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:33,420
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

259
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:41,050
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

260
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,550
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

261
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:54,470
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

262
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,130
COMING EPISODE

263
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,180
“Nothing is permanent.”
It’s a fact of life.

264
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,010
The bell tolls for the great
ones who will someday fall.

265
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,910
Money makes the world go round…

266
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,280
…but debt piles up
before you know it.

267
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,720
I wandered through
all the reaches of space…

268
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
…and there I met a cowboy.

269
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,820
A session to the tune
of an off-key melody:

270
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,530
HONKY TONK WOMEN

271
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,160
Honky Tonk Women.
HONKY TONK WOMEN

272
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,260
Honky Tonk Women.
