00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,300
<i>Space travel log 0968.</i>

3
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,570
<i>We were wasting our free time.</i>

4
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,240
<i>It sounds good to call the</i>
<i>bounty-hunting job a “freelance” job…</i>

5
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,040
<i>…but all that means is</i>
<i>that we’re self-employed.</i>

6
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,980
<i>When we have no jobs,</i>
<i>we have none at all.</i>

7
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,040
<i>Well, that’s all a
part of our destiny…</i>

8
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,280
<i>…but it’s troublesome</i>
<i>that we’re out of money,</i>

9
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,490
<i>And so, we get urges</i>
<i>to make quick cash…</i>

10
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Any problem with using these?

11
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,400
Evens!

12
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,180
Evens, is it?

13
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,070
No, odds after all!

14
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,080
Odds, is it?

15
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,520
Yeah… odds.

16
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,990
Double ace… Even.

17
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,710
I can’t eat any more…

18
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,610
Well, it would be easiest for
me if you paid up in cash…

19
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,120
So, what’ll it be?

20
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,360
A man does not take back his word!

21
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,730
That’s why I told you not to do it…

22
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,790
<i>Humans were meant to work and</i>
<i>sweat for their money after all.</i>

23
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,830
<i>Those that try to get rich quick…</i>

24
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>…or live at the expense of others…</i>

25
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,240
<i>…all get divine retribution</i>
<i>somewhere along the way,</i>

26
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,580
<i>That is the lesson…</i>

27
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,180
<i>But one thing about</i>
<i>humans is that they…</i>

28
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,310
<i>…quickly forget the</i>
<i>lessons they just learned.</i>

29
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
Dammit.

30
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,030
There was a fridge way back here?

31
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,540
<i>“Survival of the fittest”</i>
<i>is the law of the land.</i>

32
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,640
<i>To fool and to be fooled</i>
<i>is the reason we live.</i>

33
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,700
<i>I’ve never had anything good</i>
<i>happen to me when I trust others.</i>

34
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,620
<i>That’s the lesson.</i>

35
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,100
How much did you swindle?

36
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,500
Would you stop saying things
that would hurt my reputation?

37
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,130
He lost on his own!

38
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,030
Because he couldn’t
see through this cheat?

39
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,630
It’s part of one’s skill
to see through it.

40
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,700
At least give his clothes back to him.

41
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,110
I’ll lend them to him.

42
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,840
Greedy, aren’t we?

43
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,370
It’s rough out there in the real world.

44
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,360
Hey, what’s up?

45
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,520
Something bit me.

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,330
What do you mean, “something”?

47
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,210
I-It wasn’t a rat!

48
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,310
Look at this! This wound on my neck!

49
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,210
Hey!

50
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,740
This is silly. It was a waste
of time running over here.

51
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,240
Spike! I was bitten around that fridge!

52
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,050
Fridge?

53
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,490
Hmm? You have a clue?

54
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,460
I’m sure… there was something…

55
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,970
Nope, can’t remember.

56
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,890
You sure this is gonna work?

57
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,090
The only thing it doesn’t work on
are nearsightedness and cavities.

58
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,090
Then it works on athlete’s foot?

59
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,460
Of course.

60
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
Don’t you have something more
legit that would get rid of sores?

61
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
That would be this.

62
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,900
That gets rid of sores?

63
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,840
Yeah.

64
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,900
Crush this, and you boil it
in 3 cups of water until…

65
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,880
…the liquid simmers down
to 1 cup, and you drink it.

66
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,180
Spike, isn’t there something more…

67
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,950
…different?

68
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,350
Oh, I got just the thing.

69
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,620
Yeah, gimme that…

70
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,920
Gimme what you had before.

71
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,960
Hey… I’m feeling a lot sicker now…

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,270
Do I look pale?

73
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,240
You’re pretty pale to begin with.

74
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,570
What is this awful smell?

75
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,630
Herbal medicine.

76
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,170
Herbal medicine? This?

77
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,090
It smells like you just left a rag
that cleaned up spilt milk out to dry!

78
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,420
I think it’s more like rotten soybeans.

79
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,150
Knock it off!
I have to drink this ya know!

80
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,470
Oh brother.

81
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,770
Hey now, this goes
too far for a joke…

82
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,360
It was a rat, right?

83
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,450
There’s nothing to make a fuss about.

84
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,030
Am I wrong?

85
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,960
I have no clue.

86
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,470
He seems to have gotten some poison
that’s not in this database.

87
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,430
Looking at similar poisons…

88
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,400
Cryptosporidium…

89
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,430
…that’s not it…

90
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,740
Cholera?

91
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,370
Nope…

92
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,410
Ebola virus?

93
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,940
Nope…

94
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,010
Bifidobacterium?

95
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,720
Not even close.

96
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,990
What is it?

97
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,720
Ein, you’re being noisy.

98
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,790
I can say for sure that
it wasn’t an ordinary rat.

99
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,420
Hey, keep it quiet.

100
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,060
So what is it?

101
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,230
Well, it’s…

102
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,630
A mysterious space creature!

103
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,010
Spooky! The attack of
a horrible space creature!

104
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Oh yeah, there’s that possibility…

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,270
Heh… Yeah, right.

106
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,780
Then what is it?

107
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,580
It’s not in the database.

108
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,350
Yeah…

109
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,350
These base-pairs are weird, too.

110
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,150
You think so?

111
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,280
We’ve never seen symptoms
like this before either.

112
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,660
Other than a space creature,
what is it? What is it?

113
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,290
Well… um, perhaps something like
a rat went through a mutation…

114
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,360
…and evolved into
some mysterious creature…

115
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,340
…and carried a mysterious poison…

116
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,860
What’s that about?

117
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,940
That isn’t too different from the
“mysterious space creature” theory!

118
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,910
This is too silly.

119
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,510
Aiya… what are we gonna do, Ein?

120
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,710
It’s a space creature!

121
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,050
It’s spooky!

122
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,750
All right. This is made
to sense heat sources.

123
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,030
It’s usually used to find
bounties that are hiding.

124
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,730
Can you see me?

125
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,430
All right, I’m gonna test it,
so move just like I tell you…

126
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,440
Ein! Where are you going?

127
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,500
Hey, wait!

128
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,740
Hey!

129
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,310
That’s weird… Is it broken?

130
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,750
Was that response from you?

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,320
That story you were telling, about some
mysterious creature or something or other…

132
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, yeah.

133
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,060
What happens if you’re bitten?

134
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,400
I can’t say for sure until we catch
the creature, but I’m going to guess…

135
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,130
…death?

136
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,310
No… why did it have to be this way?

137
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,870
I still have a lot to live for…

138
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,150
I haven’t committed any crimes…

139
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,020
I’m still young and lively…

140
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,380
Lively?

141
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,090
Oh, poor little me!

142
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,100
Hey now, why are you
getting into this?

143
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,090
<i>August 6th. Skyday,</i>

<i>see a stranger, follow him!</i>

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you here, Mr. Spooky creature?

148
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,810
Ed! Ein!

149
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Hey! This isn’t hide-and-seek!

150
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,350
Exploration, experimentation,
exclamation.

151
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,660
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

152
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,690
I will come back alive.
I trust you, Ed.

153
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,270

154
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,170

155
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,410
You’re not in here?

156
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,140
Answer me!

157
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,280
Really…

158
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,330
Ein, Ed… What happened?

159
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
Ein!

160
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,910
Hey, hang in there!

161
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,480
Where’s Ed?

162
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,010
I can’t believe it got you this easily.

163
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,290
You’re a dog!
Where’re your natural instincts?!

164
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,240
No choice…
Guess I’m going in!

165
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,280

170
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,080
Ed! You aren’t here, are you? Hey!

171
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,750
Did that thing get her, too?

172
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,330
Don’t surprise me!

173
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,500

Come on, you slime!

176
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,860
Got ’im!

177
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,940
This thing seems familiar…

178
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,890
I guess I shoulda eaten that…

179
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,020
Oh yeah, it should be in the fridge…

180
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,130
<i>That was when</i>
<i>I remembered everything.</i>

181
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,930
<i>It was… oh, one year ago.</i>

182
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,530
<i>When I had gotten ahold</i>
<i>of a real lobster…</i>

183
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,840
<i>…I hid it in the fridge</i>
<i>in this stockroom…</i>

184
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,140
<i>…just so nobody,</i>
<i>else would eat it.</i>

185
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,580
<i>But I had forgotten about it, and</i>
<i>left it in there for a whole year…</i>

186
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,820
<i>I wonder what it looks</i>
<i>like in there now…</i>

187
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,140
Shit!

188
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,610
Dammit!

189
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,260
<i>You shouldn’t leave</i>
<i>things in the fridge.</i>

190
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,730
<i>That is the lesson.</i>

191
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,850
Sweet bean roll!

192
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,550
Mmm… can’t eat anymore…

193
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,960
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

194
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,300
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

195
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:05,000
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

196
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,740
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

197
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:20,990
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

198
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,000
The real folk blues.

199
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,410
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

200
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:42,040
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

201
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,540
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

202
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:55,460
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

203

but thanks for your support.

207
