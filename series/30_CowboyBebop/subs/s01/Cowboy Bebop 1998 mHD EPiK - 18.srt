1
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,220
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD

2
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,330
And so, the turtle took him to a
place called Ryuuguujou as a reward.

3
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,630
Ryuuguujou?

4
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah. At that palace,
they held a welcome party for him.

5
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,150
Beautiful women,
and scrumptious feasts.

6
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,950
Breams and halibut swam about…

7
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,550
…and so he spent his
time as if in a dream.

8
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,080
I see…

9
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,290
I haven’t eaten breams or
halibut in quite a while…

10
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,360
Days passed before he knew it,
and when he was about to go back…

11
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,430
…he was given the Tamatebako
as a souvenir.

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,800
Tamatebako? Is that yummy?

13
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,540
It’s not food.
It’s a chest with treasure inside.

14
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,550
I haven’t seen any treasure
in quite a while either…

15
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,810
You guys are so tasteless.
This is an old fantasy tale!

16
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,220
The turtle’s Tamatebako…

17
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,690
What were you listening to?

18
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,330
I should quit the horses now.

19
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,960
Pay up 6300 woolongs.

20
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,930
What, where did that come from?

21
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,450
This was for you.

22
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,330
For… me?

23
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,200
C.O.D. even.

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,730
To top it off, no return address.

25
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,260
I had no choice but to accept it…

26
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,040
H-Hey! Wait!!

27
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,210
Hey! What about the 6300 woolongs?!

28
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,180
Busy woman.

29
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,090
Could it be a collection agency
from the life extension firm?

30
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,110
Or…

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,680
No, could it be…

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,750
Oooh… I just have too
many things it could be…

33
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,320
So for now, I’ll just run away!

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Don’t you think it’s fishy?

35
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,360
For a woman who always claims
other people’s property…

36
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,170
…as her own to run away
without even touching it?

37
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,540
She seems to have picked up a lot
of grudges from all over, though.

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,680
I should do an explosives test and
a biochemical test just in case…

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,580
No!

40
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,780
I should return this to
the courier service…

41
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,550
…and have them refund
the money I paid for her sake…

42
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,850
Hey, Spike!

43
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,340
What the hell is this?

44
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,840
Does it make any ticking noises?

45
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,170
Nope.

46
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,040
I got data!

47
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,240
Data from the courier service!

48
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,150
The sender is…

49
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,750
A nonprofit nunnery in Europa?!

50
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,910
There’s more…

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,920
Pluto Prison?

52
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,050
Asteroid Actors’ Studio?

53
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Fourth Uranus Observatory?

54
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,790
Venus News Network?

55
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,770
Forwarded, forwarded,
and forwarded some more…

56
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,110
This thing’s been passed
around the entire solar system…

57
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,500
Here.

58
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,980
Due to the explosion of the Lunar Gate,
all data from before 2022 has been lost.

59
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,610
An antique.

60
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,050
It seems to be something
called a videotape.

61
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,680
An artifact of the good old days.

62
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,490
She’s the one that ran away.

63
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,520
She has no right to complain
even if we sell it off.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
You think it will sell?

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,990
They say he’s a maniac when it
comes to 20th century images…

66
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,130
—I’m sure he’d buy it.
—I just don’t think this is worth anything.

67
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,040
The real worth of treasures like this
can’t be determined from the outside.

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,240
You may be surprised at how
much you can sell it for!

69
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,210
I need to get enough to cover
the C.O.D. charges at least.

70
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,480
Excuse me!

71
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,140
<i>So…</i>

72
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,950
Quiet!

73
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,420
<i>Everything about this city is different</i>
<i>from Minnesota, where we were before.</i>

74
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,620
<i>Hey, brother, are you sure</i>
<i>we can get along well here?</i>

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,330
<i>Mm… To tell the truth,</i>
<i>I wasn’t so sure that we could.</i>

76
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,730
<i>But, I’m sure we’ll be all right.</i>

77
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>Because I’m here with my twin sister.</i>

78
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,600
<i>Thanks, brother.</i>

79
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,870
<i>Oh man, I have to work in the morning!</i>

80
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>Good night, brother.</i>

81
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,300
<i>Good night!</i>

82
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,740
God, that’s good! Drama series
from the 20th century are so good!

83
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,750
On the other hand…
Drama series as of late are so…

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,880
I have something you want to watch…

85
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,350
Hey, hey, hey, you can’t do that!!

86
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,120
The cigarette, man, the cigarette!

87
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,420
Don’t you know that smoke can totally
screw up electrical appliances?

88
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,290
Sheesh, this is why I hate
people who don’t know…

89
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,370
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! Sheesh!

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,170
What the hell do you guys want?!

91
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,900
What do you have against me?!

92
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,770
No grudges, but no gratitude, either.

93
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,800
I just have something we
want you to buy from us.

94
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
Ah! Is that a Beta cassette?!

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
That’s amazing!

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,380
Where did you get a hold of this?

97
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,710
This is a true find, mister!

98
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,620
It’s close to a miracle that
this thing exists in one piece!

99
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,580
Beta?

100
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,610
You don’t know what this is?

101
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh, all right, do you
want me to explain?

102
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,030
Back in the 20th Century, they didn’t
use disks like we do to record movies.

103
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,990
They used things called video tapes,
which are in cassettes like this.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,000
It’s not digital! It’s analog!

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,230
And to top it off,
it’s magnetic… Yeah, magnetic!

106
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,970
They were recording with electromagnetic
signals! Ain’t that amazing?

107
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,450
But a disagreement between
the companies who created…

108
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,140
…this technology resulted
in two standards, Beta and VHS.

109
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,120
Beta had a small cassette
for their day…

110
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,020
…and the playback decks were
compact and didn’t take much space.

111
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,890
You didn’t get that much
noise when using the special…

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,580
…replay features like
still frame and slow motion.

113
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,360
And, because Beta had
high quality images…

114
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,260
…users who were into good graphics
supported it really heavily.

115
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,500
But, there begins the unfortunate
history of the Beta tape.

116
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,970
You don’t need to tell me.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,360
This is just the introduction!

118
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,570
I told you what we wanted.

119
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,440
So how is it? Are ya gonna buy it?

120
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,880
Well, that depends on what’s on it…

121
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,670
Hey, what’s wrong?

122
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,910
It’s so hard to adjust the tracking
for these early Beta tapes…

123
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,680
This way?

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,150
Or this way?

125
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,630
It’s eating the tape!!

126
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,870
It’s not getting any better…

127
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,980
It’s coming…

128
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,350
It is… It is…

129
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,750
I got it!

130
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,790
Dogs are better than horses after all!

131
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,250
Most things get better if I kick ’em.

132
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,030
You just don’t know when to quit.

133
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,470
<i>Dammit, repay me for breaking my deck!</i>

134
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,040
You again…

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,840
<i>You broke someone else’s</i>
<i>valuable machinery…</i>

136
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,780
<i>…and you’re not going</i>
<i>to take responsibility for it?!</i>

137
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,180
And how are you going to take
responsibility for our valuable tape?

138
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,550
<i>Early Beta decks often eat tapes!</i>

139
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,850
<i>In any case, I’ll have you</i>
<i>pay for the repair costs!</i>

140
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,410
We’ll call it even with
the cost of the tape!

141
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>What?! Be…</i>

142
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,620
Sheesh…

143
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,290
Hello, Beta deck!

144
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,220
There’s just one of those.

145
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,170
Where is this?

146
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,140
The Underground City
Electrical Museum in old Asia?

147
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,540
I’m going to figure out what’s
on that tape at any cost!

148
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,100
Is it really something
worth all the trouble?

149
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,350
It’s coming…
It’s… It’s… It’s…

150
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,820
Yeah! I got it!!

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,810
Really, I wonder if those guys were
sucking up all my luck all this time.

152
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,380
<i>Ah… Hello.</i>

153
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,720
Hello?

154
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,220
Hey, helllllloooooo…

155
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,710
<i>Ah… it’s… Faye… Yoohoo…</i>

156
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,690
Wait… Hello?

157
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,190
What is this, where are you guys?

158
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,590
<i>Earth…</i>

159
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,020
<i>Earth!</i>

160
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,190
Earth?!

161
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,600
Wait a minute, you guys left me
behind to go that far away…

162
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,570
<i>Spike… and Jet…</i>

163
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,230
All right, just a little longer.

164
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
Is there really one left
in a place like this?

165
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,960
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

166
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,770
28th underground floor.

167
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,250
It’s not moving?

168
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,730
The cable broke, so it’s stuck.

169
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,810
Why are we going through all of this?

170
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
It just means that
treasure-hunting isn’t easy.

171
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,050
Treasure?

172
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,850
What was the treasure we were after?

173
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,550
The Tamatebako, was it?

174
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,230
I kinda see why the
man turned into an…

175
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,750
…old geezer after
opening the Tamatebako now.

176
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,630
Even if we head back now,
we’re not gonna be any younger.

177
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,970
This is some Ryuuguujou…

178
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,210
Where did that broad go
in the first place?!

179
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,740
It’s coming… It’s, it’s…

180
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,660
Oh well, nothing I could’ve done.

181
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,390
Races are all luck anyway.

182
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,230
Is it here?

183
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
It’s here.

184
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,700
All right.

185
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,820
Is this it?

186
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,690
Yeah, that’s gotta be it.

187
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,700
And?

188
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
Which one are we taking back?

189
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,700
Let’s see…

190
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,170
Well, bigger is always
better, they say.

191
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,320
What’s wrong?

192
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,690
The size…

193
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,590
Isn’t it all right?

194
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,620
It’s not going in.

195
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,420
Force it in.

196
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,260
But…

197
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,530
Ah! That’s not it!

198
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,130
That’s VHS, so…

199
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,400
…ya can’t see the tape!

200
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,920
Oh, hello, it’s me.

201
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,840
<i>Ein, who are you talking to?</i>

202
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
<i>Oh, it’s Faye!</i>

203
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,070
I’m glad there’s an organism
there that I can talk to.

204
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,780
<i>What is it?</i>

205
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,250
Was there anyone who went
there to visit me?

206
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,880
<i>Visitors?</i>

207
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,250
Like scary middle-aged guys.

208
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,920
You know, guys that
scream stuff like…

209
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,890
…“gimme back my money!”
or “You’re under arrest!”?

210
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,290
<i>Yeah there was one.</i>

211
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,950
Eh? And?

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,500
<i>Something about repay him, even with</i>
<i>tape munch, munch and grind, bye -bye!</i>

213
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,400
Eh? Okay…

214
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,390
Oh, well.

215
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,170
Where’s Spike and Jet?

216
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,140
<i>Disappointed and zoned out.</i>

217
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,880
I see… Hmm…

218
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,240
That’s how…

219
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,340
Oh, well.

220
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,220
If they’re so lonely without me,
I guess I have no choice.

221
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,520
I’m coming back!

222
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,190
What?!
Another package for that broad?!

223
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,600
I won’t accept it!
Take it and go back!!

224
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,070
Shit, why do I have to
pay for her C.O.D.?!

225
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,050
And not once, but twice!

226
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,310
You sure are persistent.

227
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,330
A Beta!

228
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,950
We can see the tape with this?

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,090
Yeah.

230
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,600
Hey guys, long time no see.

231
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,340
It’s done.

232
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,380
Hold up.

233
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
If you’re going to watch…

234
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,090
…pay back the C.O.D. charges.
With tax, a total of 31,500 woolongs.

235
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,490
Oh, fine.

236
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,660
We have something!

237
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,270
Ooooh… what’s this?

238
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,540
Shut up and watch.

239
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,930
<i>Um… Everyone decided to…</i>

240
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,700
<i>…send a message to themselves</i>
<i>ten years in the future.</i>

241
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,270
<i>Oh, come on, don’t laugh!</i>

242
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,940
<i>Um…</i>

243
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,090
<i>This makes me blush after all!</i>

244
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,610
<i>Eh? Something I want to say?</i>

245
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,660
<i>Good morning…</i>

246
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,660
<i>Oh! Nevermind!!</i>

247
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,480
<i>Good morning, me.</i>

248
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,270
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

249
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,480
<i>And did you wake up well?</i>

250
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,420
<i>Does the light and the wind, the air</i>
<i>and the smell, all feel brand new?</i>

251
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,420
<i>Is each and every cell</i>
<i>in your body awake now?</i>

252
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,190
<i>Today, you are who you are today,</i>

253
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,760
<i>You are a newer version of me.</i>

254
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,060
<i>Myself ten years from now…</i>

255
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,510
<i>That’s so far away for me that</i>
<i>I can’t even begin to imagine.</i>

256
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,340
<i>Am I alone?</i>

257
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,540
<i>Or is there a wonderful</i>
<i>person next to me?</i>

258
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,520
<i>Well, knowing me, I’m sure I am</i>
<i>troubling a lot of different people.</i>

259
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,390
<i>But that’s all right.</i>
<i>There’s no problem.</i>

260
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,160
<i>I will always be cheering you on.</i>

261
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,460
<i>And now for a big cheer…</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

262
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,240
<i>Go! Go!</i>

263
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,210
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

264
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,300
<i>Do your best, do your best!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

265
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,180
<i>Don’t lose, don’t lose!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

266
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,150
<i>I don’t know…</i>

267
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,650
<i>I can’t remember…</i>

268
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,160
<i>Is this… me?</i>

269
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,660
<i>I am no longer here.</i>

270
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,230
<i>But I’m here today, and I’ll always</i>
<i>be cheering for you right here.</i>

271
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,010
<i>Cheering for you, my only self.</i>

272
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,490
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

273
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,830
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta

274
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,530
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

275
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,270
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

276
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:15,520
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

277
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,530
The real folk blues.

278
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:28,940
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

279
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:36,570

280
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,070

282
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,870
COMING EPISODE

283
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,650
You know, I’m starting to get tired of
us doing all the previews like this.

284
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,910
Once in a while, can’t we
have someone else…

285
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,420
Oh? Oh! You’re perfect. All right!

286
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,950
Here, you try doing it this time.

287
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,030
Oh! So, that’s how it is!

288
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,560
Wow, this is going to be
an interesting episode!

289
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,430
Next Episode: “Wild Horses”.

290
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:31,900
