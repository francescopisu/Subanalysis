00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,900
Hello, gentlemen.

2
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,010
I have come to take your lives.

3
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,010
PIERROT LE FOU

4
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,180
Hello, boy.

5
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,160
Your partner sure is unlucky, Jet.

6
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,620
Well, he wasn’t all that
lucky to begin with…

7
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,390
This case is especially bad.

8
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,330
It would be better to not get
yourselves involved in this one.

9
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,730
I don’t care, just answer me. Now.

10
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,730
I’m telling you this
for your own sake, and…

11
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,210
…if you get too involved in this,
I’m gonna get in trouble, too.

12
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,820
You know, Bob…

13
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,610
You’re the only person
I can rely on right now.

14
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,350
I’ll make sure it won’t
be bad for you. So…

15
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,550
Don’t you say that every time?

16
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,490
Really… you always have been a guy
that likes to get into trouble…

17
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,460
All right, this is only a rumor, but…

18
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,900
Have you heard of
the name “Mad Pierrot”?

19
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,410
There he is… the rumored mummy.

20
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,620
So, I heard you got beaten
up by some weird guy?

21
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,920
I recall you were sleeping
like this once before.

22
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,790
You really haven’t shown
any improvement…

23
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,850
Oh well, it doesn’t have
anything to do with me.

24
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,740
Don’t you end up in situations
like that because you never behave?

25
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,970
Well, I have nothing to do with it.

26
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,540
So, since I have nothing to
do with it, if you’ll excuse me…

27
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,740
Take care.

28
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,610
The victim was a high-ranking
guy from the ISSP.

29
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,450
He was the seventh victim.

30
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,550
What did you say?

31
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,490
Can’t blame ya. This is top-secret.

32
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,190
Apparently those higher-ups don’t
want the world to find out about this.

33
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,260
Why?

34
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,400
Your partner is in deep trouble.

35
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,270
The guy is a perfect killing machine.

36
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,710
They say that nobody who has seen
his face has made it out alive…

37
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,340
Even those lucky enough to escape’ll be
tracked down to the ends of the world…

38
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,980
…and they always wind up dead.

39
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,120
They say he appears with a smile,
and he leaves with a smile…

40
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,740
Yeah, he is the mysterious
assassin known as Mad Pierrot…

41
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,220
Tongpu.

42
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,250
Faye-Faye!

43
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,390
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye!

44
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,560
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye…

45
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,940
Hey you, can you stop saying
my name twice like that?

46
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,630
Faye-Faye, a weird mail came, came.

47
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,780
…and I woulda been done if
I had a little more time…

49
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,910
I can’t read it!

50
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,940
“Hello, boy. I’ll invite
you to a wonderful party…”

51
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,680
Wait, this is…

52
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,620
Listen, keep the fact that this
mail came a secret from Spike.

53
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,030
Secret?

54
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,960
Why?

55
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,290
Why secret?

56
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,190
If we don’t, that idiot…

57
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,600
…will run out to meet him?

58
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,970
It’s a secret, secret mail!

59
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,280
Space Land?

60
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,580
Pretty considerate of him
to hold the party there.

61
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,340
You’re gonna go like that?

62
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,210
Well, it would be perfect
if it was a masquerade.

63
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,620
Maybe this one really
will be the end of me…

64
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,350
Just kidding!

65
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,090
Would you come rescue
me if I said that?

66
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
Idiot.

67
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,230
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

68
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,380
<i>Hey…</i>

69
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,050
<i>Oh, it’s you, Ed. Where’s Spike?</i>

70
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,620
<i>He went somewhere.</i>

71
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,810
What?

72
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,410
Not that this is anything new…
That idiot…

73
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,160
Idiot, idiot?

74
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,780
<i>Ed, I have a favor to ask.</i>

75
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,290
What, what?

76
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,600
Hello!

77
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,650
Welcome!

78
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,380
Yo…

79
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,780
Let’s party!

80
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,580
<i>You can’t enter here!</i>

81
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,590
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

82
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,890
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

83
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
Shut up!

84
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,280
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

85
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,620
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>

86
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,200
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

87
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,900
Hi!

88
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,280
<i>All right, Ed…</i>

89
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,350
<i>First, enter the ISSP’s main</i>
<i>computer, and look for section 13.</i>

90
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,050
Aye, aye!

91
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,460
That’s the section that doesn’t
exist to the general public.

92
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,230
<i>It’s a pretty tall order…</i>
<i>Can you do it?</i>

93
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,330
Yup!

94
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,460
Hello!

95
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,850
Found it!

96
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,950
<i>After you open it, find the</i>
<i>file with the code name “Tongpu.”</i>

97
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,190
Yup!

98
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,140
Peek-a…

99
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,440
…boo!

100
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,260
<i>ISSP Assassination Ability,</i>
<i>Improvement Experiment.</i>

101
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,390
<i>Experiment sample chart number 46.</i>

102
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,530
<i>Code name: Tongpu.</i>

103
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,800
<i>Confirmed a strong regression</i>
<i>of the mind during…</i>

104
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,000
<i>…the experiment.</i>
<i>Experiment was canceled.</i>

105
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,410
<i>Sample to be permanently kept</i>
<i>in a quarantine facility,</i>

106
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,680
In the beginning, he escaped
from the facilities to seek revenge…

107
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,650
…but now he seems to be enjoying
the actual act of killing.

108
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,650
His mind must be
continuing to regress.

109
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,380
So, he’s like a child with
superhuman fighting abilities.

110
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,490
Really…

111
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,620
There is nothing as pure
and cruel as children.

112
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,460
It’s show time!

113
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,770
That was unnecessary!

114
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,170
<i>Hello, hello…</i>

115
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,840
<i>Hello! Hello!</i>

116
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,170
Hello…

117
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,150
T-That hurts!

118
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,920
It hurts!

119
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,500
It hurts!!

120
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,040
It hurts!!

121
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,270
Hurts…

122
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,210
Mommy, it hurts!

123
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,970
Mommy!!

124
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,950
It hurts… Mommy!

125
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,190
<i>Spike! All right,</i>
<i>we figured out what he is! He’s…</i>

126
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,020
No. I don’t need it anymore…

127
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,920
It all ended just now…

128
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,300
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

129
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,640
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

130
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,340
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

131
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:04,080
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

132
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:13,330
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

133
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,340
The real folk blues.

134
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:26,750
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

135
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:34,380
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

136
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,880
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

137
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:47,800
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,640
COMING EPISODE

139
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,450
I knew there was something
fishy going on lately.

140
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,480
So, that’s what it was!

141
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,820
What are you guys talking about?

142
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,010
You really can’t judge
people by their looks…

143
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,820
Honestly disgusting.

144
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,520
Hey, hey, what are you
guys talking about?

145
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,860
I never thought it would
be a teenage girl…

146
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,660
It makes me despise him.

147
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,600
Who are you talking about?
