1
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,180
<i>The elders are going to be on the move.</i>

2
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,880
<i>It is dangerous over there as well.</i>

3
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,390
<i>Please hurry.</i>

4
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,100
THE REAL FOLK BLUES
(Part I)

5
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,940
What a foolish act you have done.

6
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,850
The fortuneteller told us thus.

7
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,890
“The night of the red moon,
the snake will slither…”

8
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,190
“…horribly quickly to make
use of its venomous fangs.”

9
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,960
You look so pitiful, Vicious.

10
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,900
We have informed you of our decision
that you cannot be our successor.

11
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,130
The syndicate does not need
corpses who cannot even fight.

12
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,640
That arrogance of yours will
ruin everything in the end.

13
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,750
Take him to the punishment chamber.

14
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,180
Kill me.

15
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,450
Right now.

16
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,350
You cannot choose how you will die.

17
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,330
After we let you have a good
taste of humiliation…

18
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,370
…we will send you
into the underworld.

19
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
Don’t forget…

20
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,780
…a snake’s venom poisons
slowly after the bite.

21
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,290
Sheesh, that was the first
time we screwed up so badly.

22
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,600
We never had anything
like that before…

23
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,030
…when we were all alone.

24
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,270
All told, they screwed up
our plans right to the end.

25
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,310
They really were like
troublesome babies.

26
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,780
I completely understand why
you hate women and kids now.

27
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,370
Too much vermouth.

28
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,940
Who are they?

29
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,120
Lin?!

30
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,860
I’m Shin, his younger brother.

31
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,560
Shin…

32
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,830
That’s right, you two were…

33
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,100
If you change sides, you won’t be
able to return to the syndicate.

34
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,610
What happened?

35
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,540
Vicious is to be executed.

36
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,210
He failed to pull off the coup, and has
been put under restraints by the elders.

37
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,880
You are in danger as well.

38
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,790
And Miss Julia…

39
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,280
Julia is?

40
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,630
They’re in the city of Tharsis.

41
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,160
I’ll hold them off here.

42
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,960
Please go!

43
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,560
I’ll owe you one, Shin!

44
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,020
I don’t know what
happened to Red Dragon…

45
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,890
…but it’s not really
your problem now, right?

46
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,190
Vicious, Julia…

47
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,560
To me, both those names
sound nothing but ominous.

48
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,870
Just like a magic spell that opens
a door that shouldn’t be opened.

49
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,310
You’re…

50
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,050
Hold still.

51
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,250
You are no longer a member
of the syndicate…

52
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,550
I know.

53
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,220
You, too…

54
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,790
Forget everything, including
the fact that we came here.

55
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,390
What are you talking about?

56
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,270
I’m just treating stray cats
that wandered into the office.

57
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,570
Stray cats that I can’t
ever get rid of…

58
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,500
When this is over,
I’m leaving the syndicate.

59
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,960
You’ll be killed.

60
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
I’ll let them say I’m dead.

61
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,210
I’ll be waiting at the graveyard.
Of course, I will be alive.

62
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,050
I… can’t come with you.

63
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,520
Come with me.

64
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,960
We’ll leave here…
We’ll escape from this world.

65
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,160
And then what are we going to do?

66
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,190
We’ll just live a life
of freedom somewhere.

67
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,860
Just like watching a dream…

68
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,310
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

69
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,650
Are you going to leave this world?

70
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,520
Vicious.

71
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,290
Even if it’s a dream,
that’s an impossibility.

72
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,560
Are you going to kill him?

73
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,530
Yeah…

74
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,860
…with your hands.

75
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,140
You stay alive…

76
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,440
…or you both die.

77
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,640
You can choose.

78
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,380
So there is no place for me after all.

79
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,580
I won’t go no matter who
comes to pick me up. Never.

80
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,250
I don’t want to live a life
where I’m always in someone’s way.

81
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,060
Mom! I’ve been looking for you!

82
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,570
A-Alfred…

83
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,000
I told you to wait in front
of the curry restaurant!

84
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,400
Sorry.

85
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,910
It’s all right. I’m glad you came.

86
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,110
It sounds too good to be true that
you can take care of me now.

87
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,580
Mom, I want to live with you.

88
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,050
You found a job?

89
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,420
Don’t worry about that.

90
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,250
What about your female co-host?

91
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,760
I heard she’s getting married.

92
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,230
Something about this…

93
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,220
<i>Where are you now?</i>

94
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,790
What is it?

95
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,220
<i>I’m heading out to the city of Tharsis.</i>

96
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,590
<i>You should head that way, too.</i>

97
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,960
Why?

98
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,390
<i>It’s hard for Jet to</i>
<i>get around on his own.</i>

99
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,950
<i>Especially after getting</i>
<i>shot in the leg.</i>

100
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,160
<i>I’m telling ya to stop wandering</i>
<i>around so much, and just come back.</i>

101
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,370
Don’t just assume that I’m coming back!

102
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,930
You’ve got to be kidding!

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,900
I have a place to go back to!

104
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,610
What’s with that attitude?
Like he’s all high-and-mighty.

105
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,170
What does he mean, Jet’s by himself?
He’s there… Ed and Ein, too…

106
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,080
You saved me.

107
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,410
Same here.

108
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
You’re a good shot.

109
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,250
I was getting bounties with it.

110
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,750
A bounty hunter?

111
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,420
Although now…

112
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,260
…I’m kind of on a break ’cause
there’s something going on.

113
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,230
You look like you have
something going on, too.

114
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,260
It might be good to pair up
with another woman.

115
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,700
How about it?
Wanna be my partner?

116
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,710
I have… something to do.

117
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,900
Oh.

118
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,380
Too bad.

119
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,340
Do you know any bounty hunter hangouts?

120
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,580
I can help if you want
to put a bounty on someone.

121
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,380
I’m looking for a bounty hunter.

122
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,990
I’ll drive you back.

123
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,100
What’s your name?

124
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,470
Faye…

125
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,370
Faye?!

126
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,170
Faye Valentine.

127
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,300
A common name.

128
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,640
What’s yours?

129
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,100
Julia.

130
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,370
Julia?!

131
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,080
It’s a common name.

132
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,560
I’m glad I met you.

133
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,890
Me, too.

134
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,490
Um, have I seen you somewhere?

135
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,270
If… you see Spike again…

136
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,840
Tell him that I will be waiting there.

137
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,100
He’ll know what I mean.

138
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,180
Tell him that I’ll keep waiting…

139
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,980
Why?

140
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,880
Good-bye, Faye Valentine.

141
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,490
Why?

142
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,090
Why do you know?!

143
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,620
Does it still hurt?

144
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,090
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

145
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,500
A man injured his leg during a hunt.

146
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,630
In the middle of the savanna…

147
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,540
…with no means to treat the wound,
the leg rots, and death approaches.

148
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,070
The man got onto the airplane
that finally arrived…

149
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,510
…and there he sees a land
of pure white below him.

150
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,420
The place glistening in the light was
the summit of a snow-covered mountain.

151
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,550
The name of the mountain
was Kilimanjaro.

152
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,250
The man thinks…

153
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,520
…that was where he was headed…

154
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,930
…and?

155
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,970
I hate this story.

156
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,700
Men only think about the past…

157
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,610
…right before their death,
as if they were…

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,540
…searching frantically for
proof that they were alive.

159
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,170
Turn back.

160
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,350
You told me when we first met…

161
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,190
…that you were a man who
had already died once.

162
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,160
Just forget the past, okay?

163
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,360
There was a woman.

164
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,960
For the first time in my life…

165
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,370
…I saw a woman that was truly alive.

166
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,630
That’s what I believed.

167
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,110
She was a piece of me I had lost.

168
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,440
She is my other half
that I had longed for.

169
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,980
—She’s back.
—Hm? Who?

170
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,990
Oh, man…

171
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,890
We’re not a repair shop.

172
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,830
Don’t come back just when
you broke something…

173
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,370
Where is he?

174
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,570
He?

175
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,660
The one with the fluffy hair.

176
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,770
What, can’t you just say
you’re looking for Spike?

177
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,940
Where is he?

178
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,840
He’s in the workshop.

179
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,750
What are you trying to hide?

180
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,810
You came back here just to see Spike?

181
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,880
I was asked to relay a message…

182
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,680
…from Julia.

183
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,920
Hey, wait!!

184
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,860
<i>Jet, it’s me.</i>

185
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,030
What, I don’t have any information now.
We’re not really able to…

186
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,660
<i>I’m glad you’re all right.</i>

187
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,870
<i>I was worried. It’s getting</i>
<i>to be pretty bad, you know…</i>

188
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,240
About Red Dragon?

189
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,330
<i>Yeah…</i>

190
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,710
<i>There was apparently,</i>
<i>a coup two days ago…</i>

191
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,140
<i>…concerning who was going to be</i>
<i>the syndicate’s successor.</i>

192
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,080
<i>In the end the elders won,</i>
<i>and they’re now out…</i>

193
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,550
<i>…to annihilate anyone who</i>
<i>was involved in the coup.</i>

194
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,420
<i>Your partner will also…</i>

195
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,220
Been there.

196
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,950
But why are they trying to get rid of
those that already left the syndicate?

197
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,820
<i>Anything against them will be</i>
<i>annihilated, down to the very last seed.</i>

198
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,160
<i>That’s how they do it.</i>

199
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,260
That’s the worst logic I’ve ever heard.

200
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,200
<i>Just run.</i>

201
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,030
<i>The police can’t handle all of it.</i>

202
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,440
<i>Leave Mars.</i>

203
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,340
Too late for that.

204
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,390
You have something?

205
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,360
You look like you
have some information.

206
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,700
How much will you pay for it?

207
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,040
I don’t have any money.

208
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,050
You sure came back at the worst time…

209
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,020
Weren’t you the one who called me here?

210
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,560
Or… maybe they followed you here?

211
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,130
Oh, well. It was gonna
happen sooner or later.

212
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,060
Wait!

213
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,530
Wait a minute!

214
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,170
I don’t have any money.

215
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,770
She said she’ll be waiting there.

216
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,140
She said you’d understand.

217
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,670
I don’t get it.

218
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,950
It was from a woman named Julia.

219
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,860
Someone was after her…

220
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,620
They were chasing her…

221
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,600
Jet, I can go at any time.

222
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,400
You who caused a disturbance
in our clan’s affairs.

223
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,640
By the will of the clan,
you shall be executed.

224
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,720
Let me out, too!

225
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,020
Wait!

226
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,850
Your right thruster isn’t working yet!

227
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,530
The end is the same if
we go down ship and all!

228
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,530
Will you leave words?

229
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,020
Or leave something material?

230
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,530
Nothing.

231
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,590
You shall shed red tears.

232
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,010
<i>Spike, can you still fly?</i>

233
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,520
Don’t worry about us. Just go!

234
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,080
Go grasp that thing you had lost.

235
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,550
<i>Go!</i>

236
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,430
As of now, the leadership
has changed hands.

237
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,640
From now on, I will dictate all authority
and symbolism of this syndicate.

238
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,010
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

239
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:54,350
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

240
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,050
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

241
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:06,790
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

242
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:16,040
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

243
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,050
The real folk blues.

244
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:29,460
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

245
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:37,090
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

246
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,590
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

247
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:50,510
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

248
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,620
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

249
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,630
COMING EPISODE
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

250
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,350
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

251
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,570
It sure was long…

252
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,580
—The past is the past…
—No use doing this…

253
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,080
—…and the future is the future.
—So how was it, Jet?

254
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,990
—A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.
—Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.

255
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,460
—I am who I am, and you are who you are.
—Dogs are really cute after all…

256
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,660
—Like it really matters any…
—Hey, Jet. Come on, you aren’t…

257
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,650
—I wonder why we gave him away…
—…listening to what I’m saying at all!

258
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,930
—Oh… What was it?
—Never mind.

259
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,940
Anyway… Next episode:
“The Real Folk Blues Part 2”.

260
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,650
We’ll see you again, somewhere.

261
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,200
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (Part II)
We’ll see you again, somewhere.

262
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,650
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (Part II)
What? This is the end?
