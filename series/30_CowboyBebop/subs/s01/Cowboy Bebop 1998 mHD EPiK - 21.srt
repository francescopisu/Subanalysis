1
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,160
<i>This strange story began</i>
<i>on a blistering hot day,</i>

2
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,630
<i>I had received an unexpected mail</i>
<i>from an old acquaintance of mine…</i>

3
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,300
<i>…but the message was just this:</i>

4
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,040
<i>“Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.”</i>

5
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,340
<i>“I am at the meeting place</i>
<i>of the four gods.”</i>

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,390
BOOGIE WOOGIE FENG SHUI

7
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,090
<i>Pao, the sender of the message,</i>
<i>was an acquaintance of mine…</i>

8
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,830
<i>…but it didn’t mean that we</i>
<i>kept in touch all that well.</i>

9
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,360
<i>I grew suspicious, and started</i>
<i>to research Pao’s current whereabouts.</i>

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,140
<i>They say that Pao is one of the three</i>
<i>greatest Feng Shui masters here on Mars.</i>

11
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,910
<i>But when I found his whereabouts,</i>
<i>he had already left this world…</i>

12
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,520
Are you sure you weren’t the
one that sent me this mail?

13
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,790
The one who visits from
the inauspicious back door…

14
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,860
Receive the word from the heavens,
and lead me to the sun stone…

15
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,270
Just like what the pa-kua told me!

16
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,270
Look out!

17
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,010
Where are you shooting?!

18
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,550
They sure are disrespectful fellows.

19
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,050
The escape route!

20
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,720
Hey?

21
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,620
Hey, hey!

22
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,020
Idiot!

23
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,590
Shit!

24
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,360
Hey, hey, hey!

25
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,610
Escape route!

26
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,980
Chi of Earth!

27
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,610
That was really close!

28
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,840
I’m glad you’re safe.

29
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,490
What are you doing?

30
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,190
Hey, over there… Who is that?

31
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,170
I wonder if she’s a new girlfriend.

32
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,740
For that, she’s rather young.

33
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,100
Weird one, hot dog bun, loved one!

34
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,910
Maybe she’s his secret love-child?

35
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,410
For that, she’s rather old.

36
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,880
Child, mild, wild!

37
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,880
But I’m surprised.

38
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,850
I wasn’t expecting Pao’s daughter
to be this old already…

39
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,690
You probably don’t remember…

40
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,660
…but I met you once when
you were this little.

41
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,230
How do you know my father?

42
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,290
How?

43
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,100
Just an acquaintance.
It’s been 10 years already.

44
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,310
But your father sure was unlucky
to be in a traffic accident…

45
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,680
On the way to Jupiter, there was a sudden
spatial fluctuation in hyperspace…

46
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,710
Here you go.

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,790
Thank you.

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,620
Are you the “girlfriend?”

49
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,030
Are you the “secret love-child?”

50
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,930
Rejected!

51
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,810
Mr. Jet, why were you at the graveyard?

52
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,680
Nobody outside the family knows
he got into an accident…

53
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,750
“Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.”

54
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,720
“I am at the meeting place
of the four gods.”

55
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,760
This is?

56
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Pao sent me this.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
When?

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,430
Three days ago.

59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,160
Right before the accident…

60
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,170
Please! Can you help me?!

61
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,440
I’m sure this is the whereabouts
of the sun stone!

62
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,180
Sun stone?

63
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,350
The direction, day, and time you arrived
was the best combination for Feng Shui!

64
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,840
Especially when you’re
searching for something!

65
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,750
I-It was?

66
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,990
It was!

67
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,260
Please, Mr. Jet!

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,260
Yes. About that, we will have it soon.

69
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes, I understand.

70
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,890
How was the boss feeling?

71
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,370
Well…

72
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,700
There’s no way it could be good.

73
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,430
Of course not…

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,700
Let’s go!

75
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,510
<i>I didn’t have any particular favors</i>
<i>to repay to Pao or this girl…</i>

76
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,340
<i>…but I decided to help them for now.</i>

77
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,150
<i>There were too many things that made</i>
<i>me suspicious to leave it alone.</i>

78
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,710
<i>Why did Pao send me mail</i>
<i>right before his death?</i>

79
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,620
<i>What do those words mean?</i>

80
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,420
<i>Who were those guys that attacked us?</i>

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,690
<i>And there was something about</i>
<i>this girl named Meifa as well…</i>

82
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,780
This universe is made
of three different Chis.

83
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,620
One is the Chi of Heaven,
the energy that comes from the Sun.

84
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,460
One is the Chi of Earth, the energy
that comes from a planet’s surface.

85
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,660
And lastly Chi of Magnetism, the Chi
that organisms like ourselves produce.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,690
Chi from organisms?

87
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,700
The human body always
produces a magnetic field.

88
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,300
That magnetic field and
the magnetic field of the Earth…

89
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,280
…react to one another
to create energy.

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,250
Universal Feng Shui is the
technology that reads the energies…

91
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,410
…of nature such as this to
use them in everyday life.

92
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,880
Ice cream.

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,490
Universal Feng Shui…

94
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,550
It’s not the same thing
as fortunetelling?

95
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,030
Other fortunetelling methods
only predict or prognosticate.

96
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,540
However, Universal Feng Shui has the
power to make the bad into the good.

97
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,480
For example, if you were a Feng Shui
master as powerful as my father…

98
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,970
What’s wrong?

99
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,380
I just realized that I never spent
time like this with my father…

100
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,080
Hey, now.

101
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,320
Let me point out that
I’m not that old.

102
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,820
If anything, I would be a boyfriend…

103
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,890
No, wait, that would be bad.

104
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,020
W-What am I saying?

105
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,590
At least I can be an
elder brother or something…

106
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,460
Ice cream…

107
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,560
Ice cream.

108
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,910
Let’s go, Mr. Jet!

109
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,990
I believe that “Anzan” refers to here.

110
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,510
The Mountain Hotel Building…

111
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,160
There!

112
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,460
Seiryu!
(Blue Dragon)

113
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,310
Byakko!
(White Tiger)

114
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,720
Genbu!
(Black Turtle)

115
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,190
Suzaku!
(Scarlet Phoenix)

116
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,950
Hey…

117
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,120
I know, the cross-zenith method!

118
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,730
The sun stone is here!

119
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,360
Are you sure?

120
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,250
There they are.
They’re right over there.

121
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,110
All right.

122
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,570
I finally found it…

123
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,540
This must be the sun stone.

124
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,050
This thing?

125
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,090
Mr. Jet?

126
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,960
Outta the way.

127
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,870
What are you doing?

128
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,870
One bottle of lao-chu.
I don’t need a glass.

129
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,410
Take that!

130
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,060
Hey, who are you guys?

131
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,330
Heh, you think we would
tell you that easily…

132
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,330
W-We’re from the Blue Snake…

133
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,100
So you are from a syndicate…

134
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,470
Why are you following us around?

135
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,650
I-I couldn’t tell you that
even if you killed me…

136
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,640
I-It was because we couldn’t get Pao…

137
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,750
So they told us to get
the recipient of his mail…

138
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,480
I-I’m telling the truth!

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
We’re on the low end so we
don’t know any more than that!

140
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,730
I’m sure.

141
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,710
Mr. Jet…

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,430
My father… is alive?

143
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,950
<i>Pao’s words showed where</i>
<i>this stone was.</i>

144
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,650
<i>Does that mean Pao is</i>
<i>still alive somewhere?</i>

145
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,450
<i>Did he want me to find this</i>
<i>stone and do something with it?</i>

146
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,260
<i>It feels like I created more</i>
<i>mysteries instead of solving them.</i>

147
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,030
<i>For now, I decided to check out</i>
<i>this stone, which was our only clue.</i>

148
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,840
So this is a piece of the moon from
that Gate accident 50 years ago…

149
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,940
We Feng Shui masters
call it the sun stone.

150
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,910
It’s absorbed the fluctuations
in time and space…

151
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,480
…and conceals a tremendous
amount of energy.

152
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,260
I can only think of it
as a plain old rock…

153
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,990
So, how much would it be if we sold it?

154
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,020
Hey, guys, if you’re gonna
smoke, go smoke outside.

155
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,230
What?

156
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,360
You always smoke in here, too!

157
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,740
I’m turning this into a
nonsmoking area starting today.

158
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,400
Hey, now, you’re kidding, right?

159
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,610
This ship is my ship, remember?

160
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,920
So, what are you gonna
do with this stone?

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,860
I… have no idea.

162
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,030
I don’t know what my
father is thinking…

163
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,670
Oh, hey, wait!

164
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,830
Ein! Wait!

165
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,510
The luo-pan…

166
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,640
What?

167
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,710
That can’t be…
I took the magnet off…

168
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,710
I see… I get it now…

169
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,420
So that’s it!

170
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,290
That’s it!!

171
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,440
If I remember correctly, my father
owned a sun stone as well.

172
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,770
I’m sure that the two
stones are resonating…

173
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,180
…to show me the
whereabouts of my father.

174
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,550
And that’s why Pao made you
look for this stone…

175
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,280
But…

176
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,750
I don’t know why my father
sent the mail to you, Mr. Jet…

177
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,920
…and not to me…

178
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,240
What do you think?

179
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,970
They make a good couple.

180
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,350
It’s a dangerous combination.

181
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,580
What is?

182
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,380
The more righteous a guy
was in his youth…

183
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,080
…the more likely he’s gonna fall
for a young girl later in life.

184
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,280
Is that so?

185
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,850
Really… Guys are so clueless.

186
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,790
My father…

187
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,430
…was one that believed in Universal
Feng Shui, but not other people…

188
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,600
So my mother left the house,
and took me along.

189
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,330
That was seven years ago…

190
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,910
I’m sure my father was able
to find our whereabouts easily.

191
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,540
But he never even tried
to look for us…

192
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,320
I’m sure there was a reason behind it.

193
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,480
Why was my father
targeted by those men?

194
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,460
Was it because he was
friends with bad people?

195
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,600
Please, tell me the truth!

196
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,930
Who my father really was…

197
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,940
Pao… was the consultant
for a syndicate.

198
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,480
That’s the truth.

199
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,410
Pao had leaked
information to me about…

200
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,920
…the syndicate, back
when I was a detective.

201
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,780
Pao already wanted out of
the syndicate back then.

202
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,310
However, it’s impossible
for someone who knows…

203
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,920
…important syndicate secrets
to ever leave the group.

204
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,600
I’m sure Pao was afraid that more bad
things would happen to his family.

205
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,540
Well, I’m sure you can confirm
it all when you see him.

206
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,950
Here!

207
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,990
Around here…

208
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,690
There isn’t anything here.

209
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,830
How about the radar?

210
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,870
No response.

211
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,810
That can’t be…
I’m sure this is the place…

212
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,770
Hmm? Wait…

213
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,140
Hold on…

214
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,980
Do we have guests?

215
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,540
They sure are persistent.

216
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,250
Spike, Faye, please take care of them!

217
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,690
Aren’t they your guests?

218
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,150
Help me out if you don’t
wanna die with this ship!

219
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,820
What rotten luck of the draw.

220
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,670
<i>Sometimes it’s good to act without</i>
<i>asking “What’s in it for me?”.</i>

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,400
We’re fairies who are going to
grant the princess’ wish.

222
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,460
<i>We are?</i>

223
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,180
Unmanned fighters?

224
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,210
So these would be the seven dwarves…

225
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Shit! They’re trying to scare us!

226
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,390
I got it!

227
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,080
<i>Spike! Come back here!</i>

228
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,280
What?!

229
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
<i>Apparently, if we apply lots</i>
<i>of energy to that stone…</i>

230
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,070
<i>…we can draw out all the</i>
<i>forces trapped inside it.</i>

231
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,880
And, what are we going to do?

232
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,620
This is an all-or-nothing plan, but…

233
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,560
I don’t care what it is, just hurry!

234
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,430
I put it in!

235
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,710
All right!

236
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,340
<i>Blast this rock with</i>
<i>your plasma cannon.</i>

237
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,820
What a great plan this is…

238
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,750
<i>Looks like you made it in time, Jet…</i>

239
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,950
Pao! You’re…

240
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,920
<i>Meifa… It’s been a while.</i>

241
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,460
Pao, you’re in unstable territory.
I can’t approach any closer than this.

242
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,960
<i>I know… There isn’t any,</i>
<i>oxygen left in here anyway,</i>

243
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>I sent you that mail because I wanted</i>
<i>you to bring my daughter here…</i>

244
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:43,150
Then… you willed us to be here
like this using Feng Shui?!

245
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,880
<i>Yeah…</i>

246
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,560
That’s not true, Pao.

247
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,260
This wasn’t your doing.

248
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,960
Meifa is here now…

249
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,800
…because she wanted to come here.

250
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,180
<i>You might be right.</i>

251
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,270
<i>Perhaps I was being too hotheaded…</i>

252
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,180
<i>Meifa… it’s wonderful to</i>
<i>see you one last time…</i>

253
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,650
I hated you all this time…

254
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,060
I despised you all this time…

255
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
But…

256
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,640
Papa…

257
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,100
<i>Now, I don’t know if it was a good thing</i>
<i>or a bad thing that we took her along.</i>

258
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,300
<i>In any case, this was how</i>
<i>this strange case ended.</i>

259
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,640
<i>She went back to Mars.</i>

260
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,300
<i>And the smoking ban was lifted</i>
<i>from the living quarters.</i>

261
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,910
<i>Once again, unchanging daily life</i>
<i>has returned, just as it was before.</i>

262
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,820
<i>One thing that has changed, though…</i>

263
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,980
<i>I no longer read the</i>
<i>fortunetelling pages in magazines.</i>

264
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,470
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

265
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:53,810
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

266
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,510
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

267
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:06,250
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

268
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:15,500
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

269
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,510
The real folk blues.

270
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:28,920
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

271
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,550
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

272
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,050
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

273
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:49,970
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

274
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:05,830
He… came with a whistle.

275
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,870
COMING EPISODE
He… came with a whistle.

276
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,980
He… came with a whistle.

277
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,260
A man, Andy, made a sudden
appearance on horseback.

278
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,920
Who in the world is he?

279
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,160
Is he an ally or a foe?
Or is he a true cowboy?

280
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,830
The next episode is a shocking sci-fi
macaroni-western epic saga: “Cowboy Funk”.

281
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,900
COWBOY FUNK
Wait a minute, isn’t this
world view a bit different?
