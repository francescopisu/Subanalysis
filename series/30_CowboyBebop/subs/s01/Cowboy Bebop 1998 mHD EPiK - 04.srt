1
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,360
Someone’s here!

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,860
Hello there! You approaching
this area, can you see me?

3
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,320
I’m a little troubled
because I’m out of gas…

4
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,730
Can you take me to Ganymede?

5
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,400
Oh, dammit, why does everyone?!
Why won’t they stop?!

6
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,900
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

7
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,150
This sea rat…

8
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,320
…used to be raised in
the oceans of Ganymede.

9
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,160
After the gates stabilized,
food was no longer scarce.

10
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,070
And so, now the ones in the wild get
eaten by those who have a fancy for them.

11
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,700
So, is it good?

12
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,260
It’s totally disgusting.

13
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,570
It’s just expensive because
it’s a Ganymede specialty.

14
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,670
Then it’s no good.
I’ll have the lobster miso stew.

15
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,680
That doesn’t look good, either.

17
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,350
Well, I thought I’d go for
something expensive while I’m at it.

18
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,690
You mean, because we’ll
soon have some money?

19
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,340
To think that Gould was a spy…

20
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,500
But, Mom, don’t worry.
We sunk his ship.

21
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,440
It’s all right. One vial nowadays
doesn’t mean much…

22
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,380
Let’s continue the deal
as we initially planned.

23
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,580
But… who was in charge of
watching the house then?

24
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,450
M-Mom…

25
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,690
It was you, Harrison?

26
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,330
Um, ur, Mom…

27
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,200
Hey! Where’s my sea rat sauté?!

28
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,340
Come on, there, come ON!

29
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,020
No doubt. It’s Morgan.

30
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,540
Then shall we go before
we get breakfast?

31
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,650
Hey, kid, did you know
that the Ganymede sea rat…

32
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,660
…is a very
intelligent and kind animal?

33
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,790
—What’s that?
—That woman… I think she was…

34
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,960
I don’t remember ordering a circus!

35
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,880
I know I’ve seen her somewhere…

36
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>We, the Space Warriors, work night</i>
<i>and day to preserve the environment…</i>

37
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,540
<i>…and protect endangered species</i>
<i>all over the universe.</i>

38
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,880
I remember now!
That lady’s worth 25 million!

39
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,860
Mom, hurry!

40
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,090
This is the end, Mademoiselle.

41
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,200
Mom?!

42
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,630
Don’t move!

43
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,600
Do you want to see your mom in pain?

44
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,260
Who are you?

45
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,530
How’s Morgan?

46
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,370
He’s full of holes.

47
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,900
That’s a problem. He was
gonna put food on our table.

48
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,340
But he’s worth nothing compared to
the 25 million that you’re worth…

49
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,280
—You!
—Let go of Mom!

50
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,480
Stop it. These guys are bounty hunters.

51
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,420
We can’t do anything.

52
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,080
Mom!

53
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,480
Take care of the home.
I’ll be back soon.

54
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,960
Come on. If you don’t go now,
the cops are gonna arrive!

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,790
Mom, sit tight!

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,760
Harrison, you’ll get plenty
of punishment later.

57
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,460
M-Mom?!

58
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,160
—Let’s go!
—Mom!!

59
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,500
Lucky you, Harrison.
Your mom won’t be back for a while.

60
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,520
Hey, are you alive?!

61
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,120
Please… Take this to the ISSP…

62
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,330
But… don’t open it…

63
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,300
H-Hey, wait a minute!!

64
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,430
What does he want me to do?!

65
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,410
Universal Environmental
Protection Society?

66
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,310
More like environmental terrorists.

67
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,150
They’re called the Space Warriors.

68
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,620
They used to be a good group
working on environmental…

69
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,250
…preservation and the
protection of endangered species.

70
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,250
But since their leader changed two years
ago, their focus drastically changed.

71
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,420
There are only a few members,
but now they’re…

72
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,700
…even worse than a lot
of syndicates out there.

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,960
They’re especially keen on
protecting the Ganymede sea rats.

74
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,010
And she’s the leader of this terrorist
group: Twinkle Maria Murdock.

75
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,440
Please, don’t associate
us with terrorists!

76
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,480
We are warriors of peace,
fighting for the law of nature.

77
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,050
And where can we get
the 25 million in reward?

79
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,160
The Ganymede government.
But we can’t cash in.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,060
I’m checking on it…

81
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,070
The government canceled
the reward yesterday.

82
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,360
Why?

83
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,780
When you’re told not to open it,
the more you want to…

84
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,110
I didn’t open it!

85
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,310
This thing opened by itself!

86
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,370
<i>So, as you requested,</i>
<i>we have canceled the bounty,</i>

87
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,380
<i>And we are debating</i>
<i>about prohibiting…</i>

88
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,210
<i>…the fishing of sea rats</i>
<i>on Ganymede as well…</i>

89
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,150
So, where’s Mom?

90
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,250
<i>As I said, we haven’t gotten</i>
<i>word of Twinkle’s capture!</i>

91
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,880
<i>If we can find out</i>
<i>who captured them…</i>

92
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,590
If Mom doesn’t come back…

93
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,390
…we’ll set that plan
into action immediately.

94
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,870
<i>W-Wait! We’re not going</i>
<i>against your wishes…</i>

95
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,770
Doesn’t look like it
would ease my hunger…

96
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,790
Wait a minute, that terrorist act
we saw isn’t on the records, either!

97
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,420
What’s going on?

98
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,150
See? I told you that you
couldn’t do anything.

99
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,890
So, you can just let me go.

100
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,190
I don’t get it…
There’s something behind all this.

101
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,370
<i>Hello there! You approaching</i>
<i>this area, can you see me?</i>

102
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,140
<i>I’m a little troubled</i>
<i>because I’m out of gas…</i>

103
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,340
Hey, she’s!

104
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,410
Can you take me to Ganymede?

105
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,490
<i>Please?</i>

106
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,120
<i>Even getting a little propellant</i>
<i>would be wonderful!</i>

107
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,360
Hey! Can you hear me or what?!

108
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,560
D’oh…

109
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,540
Then what?

110
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,080
You spent all the money you
took from us at the casino?!

111
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,820
As they say, “money makes
the world go round.”

112
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,190
They also say,
“thieves have no compassion.”

113
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,460
How is it over there?

114
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,300
Yeah, I’m contacting an old friend.

115
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,170
Man, there isn’t even
anything worth keeping…

116
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,570
Huh? What’s this?

117
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,940
Yes… I still don’t know
where that virus is…

118
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,450
Yes, Mr. President…

119
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
We will continue to do our best!

120
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,750
<i>Chief!</i>

121
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,850
What?

122
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,650
<i>The one who nabbed Twinkle…</i>

123
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,420
You found them?!

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,060
And, that guy told you to
take this to the ISSP?

125
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,730
Yup. Doesn’t that look
like it’s worth something?

126
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,100
So, how about we call it even?

127
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,900
I never trust anything thieves say.

128
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,830
What?!

129
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,180
What’s all this about?! Hey, Bob!!

130
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,370
<i>Nothing is really up.</i>

131
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,180
<i>The bounty has been canceled.</i>

132
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,780
<i>They’re saying you should</i>
<i>let her go immediately,</i>

133
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,290
Hey, Bob…

134
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,950
<i>When we worked in</i>
<i>the same department…</i>

135
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,550
<i>…a lot of the confiscated</i>
<i>eye drops disappeared, you know?</i>

136
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,930
W-What do ya wanna say?

137
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,190
<i>If you wanna work</i>
<i>until retirement age…</i>

138
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,800
<i>…isn’t it a better idea for</i>
<i>you to go along with me?</i>

139
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,130
Oh, all right.

140
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,640
I get what you’re saying.

141
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,620
Hey, don’t break it!

142
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>The guys are threatening</i>
<i>under the mask of “negotiation.”</i>

143
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,920
<i>They’re holding the 8 million</i>
<i>residents of Ganymede hostage.</i>

144
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,190
What do you mean by that?

145
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,200
They basically kidnapped
the leader in…

146
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,390
…virus technology and created
a virus to their liking.

147
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,700
<i>The virus is called Monkey Business.</i>

148
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,770
<i>They say that humans and monkeys only,</i>
<i>have a 2% difference in DNA structure…</i>

149
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,710
<i>…and apparently this virus</i>
<i>acts on those two percent…</i>

150
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,880
<i>So, that virus selectively,</i>
<i>acts only on humans.</i>

151
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,920
Why don’t you give up?

152
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,430
We lost contact with the ISSP spy
that infiltrated their group.

153
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,370
So, we had no other option.

154
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,600
So you’re going to
agree to their terms?!

155
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Man, this was a big one
that we caught, too!

156
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,480
It’s orders from up above!
WE couldn’t do anything about it!

157
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,920
We’re releasing her.

158
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,480
Us… or them…

159
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,180
Which one of us deserves
punishment from heaven?

160
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,290
Soon, the time of
judgment will arrive…

161
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,260
Yes… Soon…

162
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,800
The release procedure
has been completed.

163
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,540
We will continue to monitor
her using our special agents.

164
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,870
How’s the satellite?

165
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,570
It will be ready in about an hour.

166
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,050
Get the chemical tech group as well.

167
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,540
Don’t do anything until we
know where the virus is.

168
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,250
Sir, a communication from Twinkle.

169
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,690
<i>Long time no see, Minister.</i>

170
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
<i>About that promise we made…</i>

171
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,230
So… about the sea rats,
we will keep a stable…

172
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,560
…population using
limitations on hunting them.

173
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,100
<i>Didn’t I say prohibition of hunting?</i>

174
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,700
W-Well, we will look at the
demands in a positive light…

175
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,350
<i>Looks like you need some</i>
<i>punishment to understand.</i>

176
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,540
AH! Hey! Wait!

177
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,550
Mom! I don’t want to
become a monkey! Mom!!

178
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,470
<i>Alpha 1-0-5 to headquarters.</i>

179
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,070
<i>The target has entered</i>
<i>the wasteland area.</i>

180
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,640
Roger. Continue pursuit.

181
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,290
Man, they’re too easygoing.

182
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,720
Dammit…

183
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,850
All that and no reward…

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,860
<i>Jet, can you hear me?</i>

185
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,830
<i>Turn on channel 72 and watch it!</i>

186
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,800
<i>They’re broadcasting…</i>

187
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,800
<i>…from their own satellite!</i>

188
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,740
<i>This isn’t just about the sea rats.</i>

189
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>Humans, with their culture…</i>

190
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,210
<i>…have escaped from the</i>
<i>great system of nature…</i>

191
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,740
<i>…and are committing crimes</i>
<i>that cannot be amended.</i>

192
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,310
<i>Those that don’t realize this…</i>

193
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,120
<i>…are what you could call</i>
<i>“bugs” in the nature system.</i>

194
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,830
<i>That ship was a decoy</i>

195
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,630
Where are they broadcasting from?

196
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,800
It’s near here. They’re…

197
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,700
…in hyperspace!

198
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,640
<i>Monkey Business, our virus…</i>

199
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,080
<i>…takes such humans and</i>
<i>returns them to nature.</i>

200
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,170
<i>Understand?</i>

201
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,750
<i>Au revoir.</i>

202
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,090
<i>Good news, Jet!</i>

203
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,620
<i>The Ganymede government has reestablished</i>
<i>the ransom on Twinkle and company.</i>

204
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,900
What?!

205
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,060
This is our chance!
We’re the only ones around here!

206
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,970
<i>But just catching them won’t do.</i>

207
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,610
<i>If the missile falls, there’ll be</i>
<i>nobody here that can pay the bounty</i>

208
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,890
So there’s nothing to bitch about
if we get rid of the missile, right?

209
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,790
But they’re at the exit to a gate.

210
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,190
I know.

211
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,580
What about the defense system?!

212
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,550
4 minutes and 30 seconds to impact!

213
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,980
The system won’t make it in time!

214
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,340
T-This is an emergency!
Get the President!

215
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,090
They’re here.

216
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,000
It split?! Shit!

217
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,280
Jet! Get the last one!

218
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,420
What?! There aren’t any
weapons over here!

219
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,600
If I wait for the next shot to fully
charge, that thing’ll hit Ganymede!

220
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,100
<i>Oh? Are you in trouble?</i>

221
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,730
<i>How about for 80% of the earnings?</i>

222
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,790
You’ve got to be kidding!

223
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,700
<i>Okay, bye! Have a nice day</i>

224
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,570
All right. 40%. No more.

225
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,900
OK! I get the 60!

226
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,410
Fine… We got no choice.

227
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,080
Shit, will she make it in time?

228
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,950
Welcome!

229
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,620
What is this?!

230
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,660
Multiple warheads?!
This ain’t the military!!

231
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,830
Now all of you, become apes!

232
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,040
<i>Jet!</i>

233
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,270
<i>The guys from the government</i>
<i>are closing down the gate!</i>

234
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,140
What?!

235
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,040
<i>They’re going to enclose all of it</i>
<i>in hyperspace, missile and all!</i>

236
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,950
Wait a minute, this isn’t a joke!

237
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,000
<i>Spike!</i>

238
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,210
I hear ya!

239
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,670
Spike!

240
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,430
Why?

241
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,700
<i>Didn’t you learn in high school?</i>

242
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,400
<i>Matter that gets enclosed</i>
<i>in hyperspace can be seen…</i>

243
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,870
…but will never interact with
matter in this realm again.

244
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,850
Mom! The gate’s closed!

245
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,720
Hey, Mom, what can we do?!

246
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,190
Stop! Stop!

247
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,740
So… this and that and no reward.
All that work for nothing.

248
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,280
Oh, don’t look so down,
we can make money next time.

249
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,180
Well, I’ll go take a shower.

250
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,190
Next time? Make money?

251
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,290
Hey, Jet, what did she just say?

252
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,820
Don’t ask me! Just don’t!

253
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,490
And she’s off to shower
without asking us…

254
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,000
Hey, are we gonna take all of this?

255
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,770
Don’t tell me! Just don’t!

256
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,910
Fine, I’ll go tell her.

257
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,950
Hey, Spike…

258
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,110
Should’ve seen that coming.

259
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,390
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

260
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:53,730
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

261
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,430
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

262
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:06,170
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

263
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:15,420
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

264
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,430
The real folk blues.

265
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:28,840
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

266
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:36,470
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

267
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,970
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

268
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:49,890
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

269
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:05,690
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

270
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,770
COMING EPISODE
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

271
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,440
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

272
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,840
…and a nostalgic tune fills the air.

273
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,940
I then happen to wake up
from the dream.

274
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,980
There is no such thing
as a music box…

275
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,210
…yet, there is a small
music box nestled in my hand.

276
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,050
And I awake from the dream again.

277
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,320
As if I was peeling an onion,
it’s a dream no matter how far I go.

278
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,890
I can never return to reality.

279
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,420
Such a nightmare, this is.
