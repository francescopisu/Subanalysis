1
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,860
I’m gonna go look.

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,100
What?

3
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,370
I’m gonna look for my woman.

4
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,530
You can look for that other woman.

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,380
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

6
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,350
I feel like I’m in a confessional…

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,850
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,890
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

9
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,690
We still haven’t settled
the score from earlier.

10
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,930
Any time.

11
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,560
Lin!

12
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,770
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

13
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,970
Lin…

14
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,760
JUPITER JAZZ (Part II)

15
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,600
I was in the same unit
as Vicious on Titan.

16
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,100
You said that you
didn’t need comrades…

17
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,580
…but I’m attracted to that word.

18
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,080
To the point of tears…

19
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,990
On Titan, we were all comrades…

20
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,310
What song is that?

21
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,880
Julia…

22
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,450
That’s a good tune.

23
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,550
Would you mind if I played that tune on
my sax when I go home after all this?

24
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,240
After I came home from
the war, I was imprisoned.

25
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,970
They suspected that I was a spy.

26
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,670
I heard that Vicious
testified against me.

27
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,940
In prison, I went insane from insomnia.

28
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,040
As a result, I became a drug addict.

29
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,750
There were side effects…

30
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,590
My hormonal balance went out of whack,
and this is what happened.

31
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,090
You’re the second person to know
Vicious since I arrived here.

32
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,430
And the second that I’ve
talked about this to…

33
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,930
Why are you going to see Vicious?

34
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,600
Didn’t you just say that he framed you?

35
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,540
I want to see if he really did.

36
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,010
You’re going to die.

37
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,570
I’m not afraid to die.

38
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,600
You’re lying.

39
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,610
Either way, I won’t last much longer.

40
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,920
Why did you bring me here?

41
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,290
Perhaps I wanted to be with someone…

42
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,790
You selfishly help people,
and bring them along…

43
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,390
…and then you go off to die?

44
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,770
Are you sure it was this woman?

45
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,010
Yeah… It’s been 6 months since
I last saw a woman in the flesh…

46
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,350
…and 2 years since I saw
someone that good-looking.

47
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,820
Of course I wouldn’t make a mistake!

48
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,550
I never wanna live in this town…

49
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,290
She sat there, and was talking to Gren.

50
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,300
Julia always sat in that seat, too.

51
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,130
Julia?

52
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,040
She suddenly wandered in 2 years ago,
and disappeared before a month passed.

53
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,300
What kinda woman was she?

54
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,100
She was a real babe.

55
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,310
<i>I’m the only one that</i>
<i>can keep you alive…</i>

56
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,790
<i>And I’m the only one</i>
<i>that can kill you…</i>

57
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,060
<i>I’m only watching a dream</i>
<i>that I never awakened from.</i>

58
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,830
<i>It’s like I am watching a dream…</i>

59
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,190
<i>Be careful when you’re with that woman.</i>

60
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,960
<i>Women are all liars…</i>

61
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,170
<i>When this is over,</i>
<i>I’m getting out of all this.</i>

62
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,370
<i>And then… will you come with me?</i>

63
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,370
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

64
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,780
<i>They’re going to kill you…</i>

65
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,140
<i>Oh, you’re finally up.</i>

66
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,250
<i>You’ve slept too much.</i>
<i>It’s been three days.</i>

67
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,080
<i>Your left eye and right eye</i>
<i>are different colors…</i>

68
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,690
<i>My left eye sees the past…</i>

69
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,430
<i>Then what about your right eye…?</i>

70
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,220
I’m not dead…

71
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,700
Which way is west?

72
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,640
Thanks.

73
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,310
Tranquilizer, huh?
They’re mocking me…

74
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,710
Sorry, but can I ask ya something?

75
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,010
Where is a blue apartment
building called Orlando?

76
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,070
Don’t ask me! I don’t know anything!

77
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,140
Um, come on…

78
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,490
I want nothing to do with
foreigners from now on…

79
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,120
I’m just asking!

80
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,620
I’m gonna go find an honest job…

81
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
What the hell?

82
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,870
It’s here…

83
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,000
Hey!

84
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,070
Hey, get it together!

85
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,240
Jet?

86
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,480
What the hell are you doing?

87
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,190
What’s all this about?

88
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,420
He was one of those kinds of guys?

89
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,610
What are you saying?

90
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,650
Gren… isn’t like that.

91
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,660
Gren?

92
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,830
“Mangan”, with “ura-dora”…

93
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,500
He’s using an ancient code…

94
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,940
Julia was here… in this town.

95
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,910
<i>Yo.</i>

96
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,110
Yeah?

97
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,350
<i>Got anything?</i>

98
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,410
None.

99
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,850
<i>I got something good.</i>

100
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,380
Catch ’em yourself.

101
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,350
I know about the guy from
that code name “Julia”.

102
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,560
<i>It’s a guy named Gren.</i>

103
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,730
<i>He’s an escaped convict,</i>
<i>and has a hefty bounty on his head.</i>

104
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,730
<i>If you catch him, I’ll let you back on.</i>

105
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,470
Hello?

106
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,990
<i>I’m overhead.</i>

107
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,050
<i>Come to the roof of the</i>
<i>building closest to the sky.</i>

108
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,030
I’ll send a woman over.

109
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,580
<i>I don’t care…</i>

110
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,030
<i>Although I would have</i>
<i>liked to see you as well…</i>

111
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,700
You broke the Bebop, but kept
the Swordfish and Hammerhead mobile.

112
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,370
Did you leave that message
so that we’d come find you?

113
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,070
You’ve got to be kidding.

114
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,540
Were you just testing us?

115
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,550
Why did you come here?

116
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,250
I want my money back.

117
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,550
The safe…

118
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,780
…only had 20,000 in it.

119
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,520
Is that so?

120
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,620
Dummy.

121
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,960
Hey… Who is Julia?

122
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,130
Dunno… but she has
something to do with Spike.

123
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,130
That’s all I know.

124
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,460
Souvenir, souvenir, is it here yet?

125
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,440
It has an EX+ ranking. It’s real.

126
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,410
Hand it over.

127
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,150
This is the Titan Opal
that you requested.

128
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,650
Give Gren my regards.

129
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,060
You saved me from that
scorpion back then…

130
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,390
Yet you sold me out…

131
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,610
Gren?

132
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,080
Long time no see.

133
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,450
What are you up to?

134
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,750
You gave me that
music box because you…

135
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,560
…never thought I’d take
it apart and examine it?

136
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,360
You found the transmitter…

137
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,020
Julia was the one who found it.

138
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,730
She realized as soon as she
heard it was a gift from you.

139
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,600
And what about it?

140
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,900
Are you trying to kill me again?

141
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,910
We fought in the war together…
We were comrades…

142
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,390
We fought together…
on that desert battlefield…

143
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,090
I looked up to you…

144
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,830
I believed in you…

145
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,560
There is nothing there to believe.

146
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,760
Nor is there a need to believe…

147
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
Sir Vicious!

148
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,020
In this world…
there is nothing to believe in…

149
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,540
Vicious!

150
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,310
Lin’s soul won’t be saved since he lost
his life protecting someone like you!

151
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,110
I’m not what he was protecting!

152
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,280
He protected the rules!

153
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,540
You’re in the way!

154
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,670
Hey! Come on, get a grip!

155
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,540
Hey!

156
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,070
Where is Julia?
Where did she go?!

157
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,010
Do you know her?

158
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,320
Where is she now?

159
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,560
He hit some vital organs.

160
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,890
Shit, would an ambulance
come to a place like this?

161
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,340
Can you lift me up into the pod again?

162
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,170
I want to go to Titan…

163
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,340
You can’t possibly last
in your condition!

164
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,870
It would take too long!

165
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,780
I won’t last long anyway…

166
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,380
Dying during the voyage
would be a good way to go…

167
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,480
I want to return there…
one more time.

168
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,690
I want to be as close
as I can… Please…

169
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,700
I see.

170
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,240
You are Spike.

171
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,440
Julia was always talking about you…

172
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,250
That your two eyes were
of different colors…

173
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,690
That’s what she said…

174
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,190
That you get a strange feeling
when you look into his eyes…

175
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,260
What was she doing?

176
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,930
In the corner seat of the bar…

177
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,400
She always sat there while
I wasn’t paying attention…

178
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
She always requested the same song…

179
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,770
…and smiled.

180
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,850
Sadly… smiled.

181
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,650
What do you have?

182
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,660
<i>Nothing.</i>

183
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,130
<i>Hurry up and get in. We’re taking off.</i>

184
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,870
Julia…

185
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,070
What?

186
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,140
Mm… nothing. Just an
adult’s idle muttering.

187
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,580
Where did all of you guys go?

188
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,010
Someplace good.

189
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,350
Ed’s the only one left out!

190
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,850
I’ll tell you someday.

191
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,660
Nah, it’s okay, really.

192
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,520
You’re not being cute.

193
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,510
The star fell, Bull.

194
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,280
That is no ordinary star.

195
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,580
That is the tear of a warrior.

196
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,590
What is a warrior?

197
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,610
One who has finished his
battle somewhere on this planet…

198
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,230
A pitiful soul that could
not believe in the Great Spirit…

199
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,480
