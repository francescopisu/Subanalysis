1
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,050
Confirmed.

2
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,900
To our new relationship,
and our new friendship.

3
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,700
And, to prosperity.

4
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,900
The view from here makes me
sad that I must leave so soon.

5
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,570
It’s an amazing sight.

6
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,780
Next time, we should
have dinner together.

7
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,720
The Cantonese cuisine that
our head chef makes…

8
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,780
…is just about as superb
as this scenery.

9
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,620
That’s a wonderful
invitation, however…

10
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,420
To think that the day that I’d dine
with an executive from the Red Dragon…

11
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,660
Rest assured,
the food will not be poisoned.

12
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,080
I can finally take a breather.

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,510
Thank God.

14
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,560
Doing things like this
won’t do you any good!

15
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,640
Times have changed!

16
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,970
The syndicate cannot survive
just by fighting alone!

17
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,980
O-Only if…

18
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,340
…S-Spike returned…

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,550
…someone like you would…

20
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,290
BALLAD OF FALLEN ANGELS

21
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
I don’t feel up for this.

22
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,190
Wha?

23
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,140
I said, I don’t feel like doing this.

24
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,700
Then there’s no choice.

25
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,500
Wait, Spike.

26
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,480
I can’t burden you.

27
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,570
Don’t say stuff like that.

28
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,710
You know who that is, don’t you?

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,010
Superficial stuff, yeah.

30
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,070
Then…

31
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,150
Good money.
Easy to get info on him.

32
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,980
We also have a lead.

33
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,350
What makes you scared?

34
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,760
Spike, you’re deliberately
avoiding the subject.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,730
Are you hiding something from me?

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,830
So… what happened
to that arm of yours?

37
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,640
What does that have
to do with anything?

38
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,800
Nothing.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,330
So, you have no intention of telling me?

40
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,970
I could ask you the same.

41
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,380
Why is this door so damn narrow?

42
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,980
Oh? Am I interrupting something?

43
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,390
None of your business.

44
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,750
We’re supposed to be comrades!
That’s awfully cold of you!

45
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,450
What do you mean, comrades?

46
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,430
Troublemakers should keep
themselves outta this.

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,790
Well, I don’t care.

48
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,930
So, who is this? What’s he up to?

49
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,400
Don’t look without asking us.

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,640
What do you mean?
He’s just there on the screen!

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
Spike!

52
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,910
Hey, wait, Spike!

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,210
I’m taking off.

54
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,280
<i>Spike!</i>

55
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,560
<i>Shit, I won’t be responsible for you!</i>

56
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,180
Roger that.

57
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,830
Dammit! He’s such a…

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,300
Mao Yenrai.

59
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,710
A bounty of 28 million
for the alleged murder…

60
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,010
…of an executive from
an opposing syndicate.

61
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,580
Amazing! And you guys are after him?

62
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,810
What, did you have a fight?

63
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,080
Shut up. You’re being obnoxious.

64
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,790
—You’re such a kid.
—I said, you’re being obnoxious!

65
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,230
He can do whatever the hell he pleases.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,530
Oh, God…
He’s throwing such a huge fit.

67
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>You there, Jet?</i>
<i>I got something big for ya!</i>

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,930
Something big?

69
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,180
Excuse me, madam,
but I need to see your ticket.

70
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,560
Oh, I don’t have anything like that.

71
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, then, I am afraid that
you cannot enter the hall…

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,560
But, they told me I didn’t need one.

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,270
You know. The guy in the box seat…

74
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,640
Him.

75
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,500
Mao Yenr…

76
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,750
Can you park my vehicle for me?

77
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,610
If it’s not one, it’s the other…

78
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,910
Why do they all do
everything as they please?!

79
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,380
There’s a protective
encryption on this thing.

80
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,230
You worried?

81
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,560
Just watch.
These are decrypted like this…

82
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,530
See? And then, I input “Mao Yenrai”…

83
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,140
The bounty part sure
seems to be true, but…

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,580
Is this Sir Mao’s seat?

85
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,150
I looked all over for it.
Actually, I…

86
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,120
We were waiting for you.

87
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,900
U-Um…

88
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,070
They are performing,
so please stay quiet.

89
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,510
Hold it right there!

90
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,160
I’m not letting you get away!

91
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,230
Whatcha doin’?!

92
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,870
Give it back!

93
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,430
Shit. Give it back, you dumbass!

94
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,610
Really, kids these days!

95
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,740
I’ll hand you over to the cops!

96
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,410
Y-You!

97
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,710
Yo.

98
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,620
Hey, isn’t it bad for you to
drink it in one shot, Annie?

99
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,360
You coming back to life
is worse on me than this glass.

100
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,930
What terrible treatment!

101
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,200
The words of the dead are meaningless.

102
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
But I’m alive.

103
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,440
No, you died three years ago!
That’s how things work here.

104
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,150
I know.

105
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,920
The fact that you came here… means you
have something you want to know, right?

106
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,020
If it’s not much, I can be of help.

107
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,990
Anastasia…

108
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,270
Stop it! There are only two people
that can call me by that name…

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,530
So, what do you want to know?

110
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,240
Mao Yenrai.

111
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,210
What happened to him?

112
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,060
Mao-taijin?
There’s a reason for this…

113
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,660
No need to talk, Miss Valentine.

114
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,500
We have done a background
check already.

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,560
Rest assured, it will be
held in a safe location.

116
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,170
Please, to your seat.

117
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,360
You’re trembling…

118
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,360
Who… are you?

119
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,230
Vicious.

120
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,660
You know…

121
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,560
I won’t say anything bad to ya.

122
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,370
Don’t get yourself involved
with Vicious anymore.

123
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
But I know saying that is useless.

124
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,810
Sorry.

125
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,280
You’ve never listened
to what others say.

126
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,780
On top of it,
you’re a stubborn showoff!

127
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,950
It can’t hurt you to listen to
your elders once in a while…

128
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,750
About Mao…

129
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,560
He had a lot of people looking
for you after you were gone.

130
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,120
He said that you still
had to be alive…

131
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,470
You’re finally back, but Mao is…

132
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,730
Stop it already.

133
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,970
This is for Mao!

134
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,850
I’ll take that one for Mao.

135
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,540
What are you up to now…
to need something like that?

136
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,830
Where’s the broad?

137
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,280
She lost sanity looking at
the bounty figure and took off.

138
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,610
Right now she’s probably
somewhere, screwing up.

139
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,580
I see.

140
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,650
I’ll tell you something.
You won’t get the bounty for Mao.

141
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,640
He’s already dead.
He was killed.

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,020
Internal discord.
Do you understand?

143
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,120
This is a trap! I’m sure of it!

144
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah. I know all that.

145
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,490
You know?!

146
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,070
Then what, you’re Mao’s?

147
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,080
I owe him one from before…

148
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,000
I’ll tell you something, Spike.

149
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,480
This arm. It’s the price I paid
for being over-spirited…

150
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,480
…and running ahead of the game.
You understand?

151
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,350
I don’t wanna go, either.

152
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,270
Then…

153
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,490
Let’s just say,
duties of the life I live.

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,790
<i>Tee hee. I’ve been caught.</i>

155
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,230
You…

156
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,670
<i>Come to the place we specify,</i>

157
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,600
<i>Otherwise, my life is over.</i>
<i>So they say,</i>

158
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,340
<i>Lesse… the time to meet is…</i>

159
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,210
It’s because you did as you please.

160
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,080
<i>You’re being cold.</i>
<i>We’re comrades, remember?</i>

161
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,910
You reap what you sow.
Take care of it all yourself.

162
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,800
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

163
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,250
Where is it?

164
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,680
<i>You’re really gonna come?</i>

165
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Don’t worry.
I’m not going there to save you.

166
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,850
Spike!

167
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,940
Angels that are forced from
heaven have to become demons.

168
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,270
Isn’t that right, Spike?

169
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,990
I’m only watching a dream
that I never awakened from.

170
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,450
I’ll wake you up right now.

171
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,430
Don’t be so anxious, Vicious.

172
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,590
It’s our first meeting
in a while, right?

173
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,150
A plea for your life?

174
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Hardly.

175
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,940
Something like that doesn’t
work on you, remember?

176
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,930
After all, you even kill
those who’ve saved your life.

177
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,440
He was a beast who lost his fangs.
That’s why he’s dead.

178
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,940
The same goes for you.

179
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,990
Now, we want you to drop your gun.

180
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,960
What’s wrong? If you don’t hurry…

181
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,680
Are ya tryin’ to kill me?

182
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,620
Oh man, what the hell’ve I done…

183
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,250
Yeah?

184
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,260
<i>Thank God! Jet? Spike is…</i>

185
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,090
Not my problem!

186
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,360
God dammit!

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,930
Spike.

188
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,090
Do you know what your face
looks like right now?

189
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,060
What?

190
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,140
The same blood runs in you and me.

191
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,240
The blood of a beast who wanders,
desiring the blood of others.

192
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,080
I’ve bled all of that blood away.

193
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,580
Then why are you still alive?!

194
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,060
Just like that…

195
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,060
…sing for me.

196
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,980
Oh, you’re finally up.

197
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,920
You’ve slept too much.
It’s been three days.

198
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,460
What? I was worried about you.
You have to be thankful to me!

199
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,210
Tone-deaf.

200
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,520
Oh, well…

201
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,910
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

202
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,250
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

203
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,950
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

204
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,690
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

205
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:36,940
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

206
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,950
The real folk blues.

207
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:50,360
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

208
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:57,990
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

209
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,490
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

210
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:11,410
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…

211
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,420
COMING EPISODE

212
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,170
But you know what? What a tough
world we live in nowadays…

213
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,300
What are you talking about?

214
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,070
This guy, that guy… They’re all trying
to put a lid on something that stinks.

215
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,700
Yeah.

216
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,770
Can we let things go on like that?

217
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,510
I’m asking you,
what are you talking about?

218
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,350
World affairs, man! World affairs!

219
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,600
With all these lids about,
the world’ll be buried in lids!

220
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,880
I don’t really get it…

221
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
With stuff like that,
you can’t see the truth!

222
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,650
Truth, huh?

223
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,750
So lids like that…
I’ll crush them all away!

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,400
