1
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,300
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

2
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,510
Those who don’t work, don’t eat.

3
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,240
Go find your own food.

4
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,550
Me? I’m okay.

5
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,750
Women are grand by birth.

6
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,690
3 million…

7
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,360
Well, I’ll have the
guys earn it for me.

8
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,230
Damn, blues harp music is good.
It’s just as good as I thought.

9
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,700
I thought you were a fan of jazz music?

10
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,530
Don’t be stupid.

11
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,110
I even warbled when I was
sucking on my mother’s milk!

12
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,180
You were a pretty thoughtful kid…

13
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,980
No mistake, that’s Giraffe.

14
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,620
All right, I’m going from the right.

15
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,530
You go from the left.

16
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,860
There’s a fatso in the way…

17
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,830
That’s… Fatty.

18
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,240
The ball’s in your court.

19
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,570
Hey, Fatty!

20
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,580
Fatty River! Long time no see!

21
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh! Who’d have thought, it’s Jet Black!

22
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,580
When the hell did you get here?

23
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,310
How about you? You look so easygoing!

24
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,520
Did ya catch a big one?

25
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,090
I didn’t know you were
a fan of blues music.

26
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,890
You’re kidding me.

27
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,420
I’ve lived only for the blues
since I was in my dad’s sack!

28
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,000
Give him back!

29
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,840
Zebra!

30
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,520
Hey you! Don’t die!

31
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,710
Hey!

32
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,190
Shit, are you going to
wipe out my bounty?

33
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,560
D-Don’t be fooled by his appearance…

34
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,530
You idiot! Don’t speak!

35
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,860
…him… Help…

36
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,230
…him…

37
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,210
This stone…

38
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,970
Hey!

39
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,240
I can’t say for sure
until I analyze it…

40
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,010
…but it might be worth a hefty sum…

41
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,910
So, what are ya gonna do?

42
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,680
Like I know?

43
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,810
He’s the one who gave it to me and
he’s the one who went off and died.

44
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,480
I see no harm in keeping it.

45
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,490
There is no harm.

46
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,650
After all, it’s not your
duty to help the kid.

47
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,130
This is gonna pay for our food.
There’s none for you.

48
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,190
You have such a poor heart…

49
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,700
I’m not like that.

50
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,100
Here, have a gift.

51
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,900
Oh, what’s this?

52
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,280
An invoice? What for?

53
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,680
All the expenses that you’ve
racked up on our ship.

54
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,510
Thanks for your business!

55
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,610
You’re welcome.

56
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,620
So why are you asking
about the dead bounty?

57
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,320
Well… uh…

58
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,590
So you were after Giraffe, too.

59
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,190
Ya got a good deal?

60
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,930
Go ahead, eat.

61
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,510
Ah well.
There’s no bounty in it anyway.

62
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,410
Yeah. No gain at all.

63
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,540
No, no. There really is nothing.

64
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,740
Ah well. You’ll owe me one for today.

65
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,210
You know that kid on the
blues harp the other day?

66
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,160
Giraffe was after
that kid Wen’s father.

67
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,820
His old acquaintance, Zebra.

68
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,260
Acquaintance?

69
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,230
You didn’t even know that?

70
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,930
That they were the top of the Volunteer
Self Defense Squad until ten years ago?

71
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,900
<i>But why is he after an old comrade?</i>

72
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,880
<i>Ten years ago, Zebra and Giraffe</i>
<i>attempted to reclaim a certain facility,</i>

73
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,550
<i>But, a few days later,</i>
<i>Zebra ends up missing…</i>

74
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,580
<i>…and Giraffe finds himself blindfolded</i>
<i>in a weird place he’d never seen before.</i>

75
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,330
<i>Giraffe was going after the top spot</i>
<i>in the group, but he was betrayed.</i>

76
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,560
<i>But Zebra was still alive…</i>

77
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,150
So, in the end, Giraffe was
killed by some form of betrayal?

78
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,950
Women easily betray others,
but men live for duty.

79
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,950
Duty, huh?

80
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,920
That’s what I’d like to believe.

81
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,810
Who are you?

82
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,790
Someone suspicious.

83
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,520
What do you want?

84
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,900
Giraffe asked me…

85
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,560
…to help you.

86
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,140
But Zebra shot Giraffe…

87
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,500
Yeah…

88
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,780
Then why did Giraffe tell
him to help the kid?

89
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,510
This kid’s showing up here, too.

90
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,810
He must be pretty famous.

91
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,080
Yeah. The kid’s a genius.

92
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,250
This guy isn’t Zebra!

93
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,620
What?!

94
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,320
Look… the date!

95
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,590
What the?!

96
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,600
Why the hell is this kid in an article
from 30 years ago with the same face?!

97
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,330
Come on. There’s nothing to fear.

98
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,570
Come over here.

99
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,430
Little twerps should stay outta this.

100
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,420
If you stick your neck
in too far, you’ll get burnt.

101
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,410
Don’t give me that
conceited crap, kid.

102
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
I ain’t a kid.

103
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,330
All kids say that.

104
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,790
I may look like this, but…

105
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,820
…I’ve been alive since
the days when humans…

106
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,600
…crawled only on
the face of the Earth.

107
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,510
It started on the day of the accidental
explosion of the hyperspace gate.

108
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,870
My body has ceased to age.

109
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,620
I can’t die.

110
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,720
The guys that took interest in me, and
experimented on me, all died before me.

111
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,000
The end for this guy started
when he snuck into the lab.

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,760
I needed a “parent” to use as a cover.

113
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>D— Don’t be fooled</i>
<i>by his appearance…</i>

114
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,710
<i>…him…</i>

115
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,170
<i>Help…</i>

116
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,640
<i>…him…</i>

117
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,310
I think this was the third guy.

118
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,080
Now, gimme the ring.

119
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,590
Ring? What ring?

120
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,460
That’s fine…

121
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,660
Even if you had it,
it’s a pearl before swine.

122
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,100
Give me a break, you big klutz!

123
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,470
You’re lucky you got
away with this little…

124
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,110
…since we don’t have
the money for a funeral!

125
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
Sorry.

126
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,850
Knock it off, Ein!

127
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,360
Shut up.

128
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,590
Oh?

129
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,340
Jet, the alpha-catch.

130
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,680
Shit… this piece of junk…

131
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,280
All right!

132
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,980
Now… what are ya seein’?

133
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,990
The hotel.

134
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,700
He’s remembering the time
that Giraffe died.

135
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,660
<i>Give him back! Zebra!</i>

136
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,190
<i>Come over here!</i>

137
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,460
Shit!

138
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,060
And then what?

139
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,870
What did Giraffe say?!

140
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,240
<i>I have it now.</i>
<i>I can do you in with this.</i>

141
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,870
<i>This is a stone that</i>
<i>will return time to you!</i>

142
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,340
<i>Now, hand Zebra over to me!</i>

143
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,850
<i>Zebra!</i>

144
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,080
When the Gate exploded,
a vast amount of energy and…

145
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,780
…an imaginary coordinate system
were created from the…

146
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,060
…resulting twists in hyperspace and
got enclosed into the gem of this ring.

147
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,800
And that same energy broke
Wen’s circadian rhythm.

148
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,000
His pineal gland continually
produces a substance…

149
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,380
…similar to melatonin
that inhibits aging.

150
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,810
That’s how the theory
goes in a nutshell…

151
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,010
You understand?

152
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,310
Like I do…

153
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,310
I don’t either.

154
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,450
So, in other words,
there’s no way to make sure…

155
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,720
…other than to stick
that gem into Wen.

156
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,750
I don’t know what will happen.

157
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,290
It might explode the
moment you shoot it in…

158
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,800
This makes me excited.

159
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,180
What?

160
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,570
I thought this might be
the last time I’d see you…

161
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,210
…so I thought I’d see you off.

162
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,310
Oh, so you’re finally
going to leave us?

163
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,380
No, you aren’t coming back.

164
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,160
I don’t like it.

165
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,160
I don’t like it one bit.

166
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,880
Men are such idiots…

167
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,360
I see…

168
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,820
I can finally die now…

169
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,790
I feel so heavy…

170
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,600
But… I feel so at ease now…

171
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,770
Do you know?

172
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:57,240
Do you understand? Do you…

173
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,490
Like I do…

174
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,440
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

175
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,780
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

176
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,480
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

177
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,220
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

178
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:15,470
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

179

…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

183

…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…
