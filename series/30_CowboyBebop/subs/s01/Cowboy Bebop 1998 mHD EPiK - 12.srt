1
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,300
The star fell, Bull.

2
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,040
That is no ordinary star.

3
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,270
That is the tear of a warrior.

4
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,540
What is a warrior?

5
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,310
One who has finished his battle
somewhere on this planet…

6
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,180
A pitiful soul that could not
believe in the Great Spirit…

7
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,320
The report from Callisto went
directly to Sir Vicious.

8
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,820
He is requesting a deal for Red-Eye.

9
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,560
30,000 Woolongs per gram.
A total of 7500 grams.

10
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,670
Why did he specify you as the dealer?

11
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,270
He is a Titan veteran.
We were in the same unit.

12
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,110
Why does he rely on you now?

13
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,940
Callisto is undergoing
a depression right now.

14
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,320
If he can’t see the future,
he is sure to worry.

15
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,250
All the more reason to keep
our hands out of that moon.

16
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,820
Vicious, are you not
the one that is worrying?

17
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,700
You have no permission to
make your own decisions.

18
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,000
Regardless of who it is, those who go
against the Van’s will are punished.

19
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,630
You believe that I would
betray my own mentor?

20
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,270
Mao’s case was merely bad luck.

21
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,110
Lin… You shall go with Vicious.

22
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,480
Yes.

23
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,570
Wang Long!

24
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,420
Callisto is a frigid planet.

25
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,150
Take plenty of winter clothes.

26
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,490
To me, no cold climate is
worth taking precautions for.

27
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,690
It is true that the planet
is warmer than your heart.

28
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,970
Your heart is colder
than a snake’s skin.

29
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,800
Vicious.

30
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,450
A snake cannot eat a dragon.

31
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,130
I will be fine by myself.

32
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
I’ll go with you.

33
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,860
Remember this.

34
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,200
If you want to survive,
you must betray me at times.

35
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,760
No, never.

36
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,210
That would go against the Van’s will.

37
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,730
Such old-fashioned thinking
makes me nauseous.

38
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,980
Those damn corpses!

39
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,910
I will protect you,
for the honor of the Red Dragon.

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,410
Honor, huh?

41
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,220
Then, it’s up to me
to slaughter them all!

42
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,890
JUPITER JAZZ (Part I)

43
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,090
It’s hot…

44
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,630
Where are the others?

45
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,170
What a depressing bunch…

46
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,880
What’s with this humidity?

47
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,880
It’s so muggy that I can’t sleep!

48
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,220
Oh, it’s just a breakdown.

49
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,310
It’d be hard for me to do
if I saw your faces…

50
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,920
…so I’m leaving without seeing you one
last time. Please don’t look for me.

51
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,430
That wench…

52
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,330
She sucked out all the
antifreeze from the radiator.

53
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
It’ll be out for at least half a day.

54
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,030
Even if she didn’t pull this stunt
we wouldn’t look for her. Right?

55
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,110
She emptied out the safe as well.

56
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,640
7, 8, 9… hello!

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,020
Are you really looking for Faye?

58
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,820
1, 0, 1, 1, goodbye!

59
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,290
Are you just wasting time?

60
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,260
Is there anything else to do right now?

61
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,060
—Ooh! Boom!
—You found her?!

62
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,130
I wonder who this is…

63
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,070
Lesse… code name…

64
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,530
Julia!

65
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,830
Where is that coming from?!

66
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,170
Lesse…

67
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,710
Pretty close…

68
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,270
Looks like Blue Crow on Callisto…

69
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,570
Where’s it going to?

70
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,780
It got disconnected…

71
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:46,720
Hey!

72
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,220
But…

73
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,450
Actually, there are no
girls in Blue Crow.

74
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,290
Honestly…

75
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,760
Hey, Spike…

76
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,260
Is that it?

77
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,440
Hey!

78
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,740
Hey, wait, Spike!

79
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,000
That’s a common woman’s name!

80
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,570
What about Faye?

81
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,950
Leave her.

82
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,680
This is a lawless area.

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,480
A woman surely can’t survive
wandering about all alone!

84
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,710
Feeling sympathetic?

85
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,380
Plenty of sympathy…
for the money she ran away with!

86
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,560
Spike!

87
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,800
I’m gonna go look.

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,990
What?

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,800
I’m gonna look for my woman.

90
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,710
You can look for that other woman.

91
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,200
You’re gonna have nothing
to do with this?

92
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,970
That’s right. We only go so far.

93
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,310
Even if you come back, there
won’t be a place for you here.

94
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,520
Can’t do anything about it.

95
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,720
I’m sure you’re not as lonely now
that you have more strange roommates.

96
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,190
Me?

97
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,360
You stayed here just for that reason?

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,990
You’re being stupid!

99
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,090
It’s been three years
since I teamed up with you.

100
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,000
But I never knew you
looked at me that way!

101
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,370
I was under the impression
that you were the lonely one!

102
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,240
Well we got rid of
that misunderstanding.

103
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,440
Good riddance!!
Now we’ll have more money for food!

104
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,850
I never did understand you,
even to the very end!

105
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,940
I don’t understand, either.

106
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,520
So long!

107
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,800
I don’t know any woman.

108
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,740
Like I would know!

109
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,940
Not even a rumor?

110
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,450
I have no luck with ’em!

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,080
I’d rather be with an armadillo!

112
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,240
Have you heard of the name Julia?

113
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,350
You shoulda said so earlier!

114
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,590
There’s one in front of
Tony’s place every night!

115
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,530
Excuse me! I’m not Julia.

116
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,230
Ju-li-us! I’m Julius!

117
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,230
Oh, I see…

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,670
Hey, you’re my type.

119
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,400
Wanna hang out with me tonight?

120
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,430
I’m sorry, I already have plans.

121
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,440
Oh, yeah. Gren might know something…

122
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,350
I’ve seen him with a woman before.

123
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,510
Gren?

124
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,680
It’s cold.

125
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,380
Looks like this is it for tonight.

126
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,720
Oh, a customer?

127
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,820
Not even. Can’t you tell he’s straight?

128
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,690
Come on, let’s switch locations.

129
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey, who and where is Gren?

130
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
So you wanna hang out with me tonight?

131
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,170
He’s a sax player in Blue Crow.

132
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,450
Take care.

133
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,520
That was close.

134
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,430
When someone sneezes
and doesn’t get told…

135
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,990
…to take care, that
person becomes a fairy…

136
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,690
That’s what they say around here.

137
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,360
Then it’s okay.

138
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
I’m already a fairy.

139
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,870
I’m not as easy as I appear to be.

140
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,720
Unfortunately, I am not
interested in women…

141
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,380
Oh, that’s a shame…

142
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,480
But the others seem to
be highly interested.

143
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,420
You didn’t know that there
were no women in this town?

144
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,890
So I’ll be very popular…

145
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,270
You should watch out…

146
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,110
Thanks for the warning.

147
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,020
I’m searching for something…

148
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,750
There’s nothing here.

149
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,730
The only things are stale bread,
a broken-down car, and rancid booze.

150
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,760
I’m looking for a guy named Gren.

151
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
No idea.

152
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,330
I see.

153
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,990
Hey, you need something?

154
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,630
You’re Vicious, right?

155
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,500
Me?!

156
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,930
Where’s the money?

157
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,740
If ya don’t put out,
it won’t do ya any good!

158
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,350
This is annoying…

159
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,350
So annoying it’s repulsive!

160
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,310
What the hell do you mean?!

161
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,050
Why the hell am I Vicious?

162
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,290
There was info that there was
gonna be some deal for Red-Eye.

163
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,480
From Gren to Vicious.

164
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,220
I thought of taking that cash…

165
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,300
You think I look like I got money?

166
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,270
Foreigners are all rich.

167
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,970
And the code name was Julia?

168
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,340
Heh… Sure sounds like
some easy wench’s name!

169
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,710
Yeah… really.

170
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Gimme a Cowboy.

171
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,910
There are no bounties around here.

172
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,460
Bourbon with milk.

173
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,260
Oh, That Cowboy. I knew that.
You can’t possibly be a bounty-hunter.

174
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,000
<i>So, who’s our customer today?</i>

175
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,370
<i>Grencia Mars Elijah Guo Eckener.</i>

176
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,670
<i>That’s a long name!</i>

177
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,760
<i>Yeah. He escaped from military,</i>
<i>prison three years ago…</i>

178
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,870
<i>…and the statute of limitations</i>
<i>is about to expire.</i>

179
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,770
<i>…and that means?</i>

180
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,940
<i>The bounty is double!</i>

181
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,050
<i>This is a chance you can’t miss!</i>

182
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,710
<i>But I kinda feel like</i>
<i>we can let him go…</i>

183
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,950
<i>Judy, what are you saying?</i>

184
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,980
<i>He’s an escaped convict!</i>

185
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,560
<i>But Punch…</i>

186
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
<i>He’s very handsome!</i>

187
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,430
<i>Just look at his picture!</i>

188
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,360
<i>Lesse… Oh, come on…</i>

189
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,330
<i>I’m much more handsome than he is…</i>

190
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,860
<i>Punch, I just can’t</i>
<i>laugh at that joke…</i>

191
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,430
Hey, can you turn that thing off?!

192
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,530
Well, calm down.

193
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,200
I’m sorry, man.

194
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,940
Don’t worry. That guy passed
out over there is a cop.

195
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,570
What do ya wanna say?

196
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,420
Actually, there’s a
bounty on my head, too.

197
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,790
This place is a hideout
for people like that.

198
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,750
I see…

199
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,090
So you can rest assured.

200
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,320
Me?

201
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,430
What’s with this?

202
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,100
I wanted to get rid of all this
frustration, and nobody’s coming?

203
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,740
Oh… you’re all here.

204
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,950
Miss, your appearance is
rather harmful to the eyes.

205
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,040
Or are you enticing us?

206
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah, I am…

207
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,510
Hold on a minute.

208
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,450
If I don’t do this, I’ll chip a nail…

209
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,930
Okay, any time now!

210
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,690
You wench!

211
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,900
Hurry!

212
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,430
Why did you bring me here?

213
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,530
Because you said you’re a fairy.

214
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,130
Why did you come with me?

215
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,540
’Cuz I got no place to stay.

216
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,510
You can trust me that easily?

217
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,070
You said you weren’t
interested in women.

218
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,640
I might take your money and kill you…

219
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,490
That’s fine.

220
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,990
I’ve lived longer than I seem.

221
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,460
It’s broken.

222
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,910
You came to such a slummy
neighborhood all by yourself?

223
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,210
I’m alone.

224
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,180
I don’t want comrades…

225
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,510
…and it’s not worth having any…

226
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,140
I end up worrying about
things I don’t have to…

227
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,450
You know, ’cuz I’m
such a good woman…

228
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,790
All the guys end up fighting for me.

229
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,320
They often say that humans
can’t live alone…

230
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,630
But you can live pretty
long by yourself.

231
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,840
Instead of feeling alone in a group…

232
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,310
…it’s better to be alone
in your solitude.

233
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,950
When I’m dealing with them,
it’s nothing but trouble…

234
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,180
And I don’t get squat out of it…

235
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,090
So it doesn’t matter if
I’m there or not…

236
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,050
You just got scared of losing them.

237
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,030
So you distanced yourself from them.

238
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,430
You’re weird.

239
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,840
Think so?

240
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,870
I don’t know why I’m
talking to you about this…

241
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,110
I feel like I’m in a confessional…

242
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,350
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

243
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,340
No…

244
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,590
Take care.

245
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,270
You want to take a shower?

246
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,570
No thanks.

247
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,300
I don’t know where
peeping toms might be…

248
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,010
You shouldn’t peek, either.

249
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,340
Hm, I can’t guarantee that.

250
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,030
<i>Gren… You’re not there?</i>

251
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,760
Vicious?!

252
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,770
<i>I’m out with “honroutou”.</i>

253
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>Along with the “mangan” and the</i>
<i>“ura-dora”, it’s 32000. I’ll be waiting.</i>

254
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,650
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

255
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,620
Sir Spike!

256
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,320
Hey, Lin. You’ve gotten pretty big.

257
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,820
He used to work under you,
but things are different now.

258
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,390
I feel sorry for her. Having her name
used for some crooked deal like this.

259
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,630
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

260
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,010
We still haven’t settled
the score from earlier.

261
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,340
Any time.

262
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,810
Lin!

263
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,590
Get out of the way, Lin!

264
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,330
Julia was here, in this town.

265
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,660
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

266
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,730
Lin…

267
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,650
A woman?

268
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,020
W-Which are you?

269
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,330
I am both, but I am neither.

270
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,290
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

271
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,630
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

272
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

273
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:06,070
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

274
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:15,320
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

275
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,330
The real folk blues.

276
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:28,740
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

277
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:36,370

278
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,870

282
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,320
Hey… How are men and women different?

283
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,900
Hmm… I think women are hiding
more vital things than men are.

284
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,270
Yeah… but there are women
that aren’t feminine.

285
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,930
And there are men
that aren’t masculine.

286
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,400
What about those that
aren’t normally feminine…

287
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,870
…but show that side on
some chance circumstance?

288
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,930
I like that.

289
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh?

290
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,940
I’m not talking about you.

291
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,040
Then who?

292
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,940
Maybe it’s Ed!
