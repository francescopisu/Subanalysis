1
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,170
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

2
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,230
<i>Always, alone.</i>

3
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,360
JAMMING WITH EDWARD

4
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,540
<i>38th district is sunny,</i>

5
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>Slight rock showers.</i>

6
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,680
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 20%.</i>

7
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,060
<i>39th district is cloudy,</i>

8
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,530
<i>Chance of rock showers</i>
<i>this afternoon is 10%.</i>

9
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,310
Bebop, here, here! Welcome!

10
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,590
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 90%…</i>

11
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,140
<i>Now, it’s time for today’s news topics.</i>

12
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,240
<i>Today, we’ll discuss the</i>
<i>mysterious land paintings…</i>

13
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,350
<i>…that suddenly appeared in</i>
<i>what was South America.</i>

14
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,840
<i>As usual, we have commentaries by a
researcher of supernatural phenomena…</i>

15
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,650
<i>Me, Yuuri Kellerman.</i>

16
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,850
<i>Yuuri, about these land paintings…</i>

17
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,630
<i>Yes, yes. Well, I believe that it</i>
<i>was some sort of a message.</i>

18
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,540
<i>Um, who would it be from…?</i>
<i>Can it be…?</i>

19
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,300
<i>Aliens!</i>
<i>It has to be from aliens!</i>

20
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,570
<i>However, the land paintings were drawn</i>
<i>by lasers coming from satellites…</i>

21
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,850
<i>The police think it was a prank pulled</i>
<i>by a hacker who got into the satellite.</i>

22
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,950
<i>They already have a bounty of</i>
<i>8 million woolongs on the culprit…</i>

23
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,980
<i>Listen carefully, The bounty of 8 million</i>
<i>is a conspiracy of the government.</i>

24
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,050
<i>Even if it was drawn by a laser,</i>
<i>there is the possibility…</i>

25
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,630
<i>…that aliens put a message</i>
<i>into the brain of that hacker.</i>

26
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,840
<i>Once again, the government is</i>
<i>hiding something from us.</i>

27
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,210
<i>I see… A secret cult…</i>

28
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,730
<i>Yes! And that is the mystery that I
have been searching for all this time!</i>

29
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,150
I’ll pass on this one after all.

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,650
You’re leaving me alone with her?

31
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,380
Nothing wrong with it.
She’s gung-ho about it.

32
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,120
I’m not the type to be
led around by women.

33
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,590
Then lead her around.

34
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,820
I’m even less the type to do that.

35
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,290
It’s easier to…

36
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,270
…divide 8 million
between two than three.

37
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,770
Here we go.

38
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,470
I’m appalled. You’re afraid of hackers?

39
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,180
I just hate tedious work like that.

40
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,480
Guys cheap enough to hack into things
are depressed pale fatsos with glasses.

41
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,650
And I’m sure he’s a demented
otaku with smelly feet.

42
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,050
Piece of cake!

43
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,780
Do you have something
against someone like that?

44
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,690
I mean, they might’ve all been
like that when you were young…

45
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,130
You’re saying I look older than you?

46
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,030
You can’t tell a woman’s age
just by looking at her.

47
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,000
Exactly.

48
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,730
You can’t tell just by looking
that I can do things like this…

49
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,430
That’s all I know of you.

50
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,240
You guys make a good team.

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,110
Hurry up!

52
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,510
I’ll be waiting for
a souvenir from Earth.

53
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,910
There’s nothing made
on Earth that’s good.

54
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,780
<i>Well…</i>

55
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,810
<i>About this incident…</i>
<i>apparently, a pretty…</i>

56
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,790
<i>…old artificial satellite</i>
<i>has been hacked into.</i>

57
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,060
<i>The investigation is taking</i>
<i>longer than expected because…</i>

58
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,260
<i>…the access code to that</i>
<i>satellite has been long lost.</i>

59
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,500
<i>Now, a commentary from Mr. Amjad.</i>

60
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,330
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

61
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,460
<i>About the relationship between</i>
<i>Earth and the hacker…</i>

62
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,870
<i>Yes. Since the Gate</i>
<i>accident 50 years ago…</i>

63
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,210
<i>…the people of Earth have</i>
<i>migrated underground as a result…</i>

64
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,240
<i>…of the change in climate, namely,</i>
<i>moon rocks falling onto the planet.</i>

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,220
<i>To them, the ’space network’</i>
<i>created by computers is…</i>

66
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,750
<i>…necessary for them to stay in</i>
<i>contact with those living in space.</i>

67
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,250
<i>I see.</i>

68
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,090
<i>That’s becoming a foundation</i>
<i>to create outstanding hackers.</i>

69
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,030
Radical Edward!

70
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,800
It’s the police! Come out!

71
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,230
Yeah!

72
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
What? What’s wrong?

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,730
I saw it!

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,180
Why!?

75
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,950
There’s nobody in there!

76
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,170
Mistake, mistake.

77
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,010
Okay.

78
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,610
This is where the satellite
was when it was hacked.

79
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,590
This is where it could
be accessed from.

80
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,760
I’ll look at all the antennae that
can transmit light signals one by one.

81
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,920
I’ll ask around for info on any
prominent hackers in the area.

82
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Bebop’s lookin’ for
land picture criminal…

83
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,510
All right!

84
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,660
Satellite of long, long ago…

85
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,560
Where in the world
is your access code?

86
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,670
Okay. Let’s start with all the antennae
that are currently communicating…

87
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,250
That’s probably Ed, man.

88
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,890
I hear he’s a huge guy, 2 meters tall.

89
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,730
Supposedly, he used to
be a basketball player.

90
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,560
Yeah, I know Ed.

91
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,070
Radical Edward.

92
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I hear she’s a very beautiful
yet whimsical hacker.

93
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,700
No, no, that hacker is a child.

94
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,910
A brat that loves
horrible pranks, I hear.

95
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,410
Oh, what I heard from the lady next
door is that that hacker is gay.

96
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,490
Hacker? You mean Ed?

97
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,050
He’s an alien!

98
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,760
That’s what everyone says!

99
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,370
Hey, man!

100
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,040
Can you buy some of this
as the price for the info?

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,270
What is that?

102
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,870
You don’t know?

103
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,510
It’s “Piyoko,” a well-known
specialty of Earth!

104
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,480
The stolen satellites…

105
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,420
Where are you?

106
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,630
Huh? What’s this?

107
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,230
The information isn’t
connected to Earth.

108
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,740
It’s connected only
between satellites.

109
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,370
And nobody hacked into it…

110
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,170
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

111
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,080
<i>Always, alone.</i>

112
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,750
A voice… inside… head…

113
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,400
Who are you?

114
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,430
Eh? What? What did you just say?

115
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,910
<i>Who, you? Here, always.</i>

116
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,710
Edward. A ’net diver from Earth.

117
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,840
<i>Earth?</i>

118
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,370
Yup. Hey, what’s your name?

119
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,350
<i>I am the satellite control program</i>
<i>on the D-135 artificial satellite.</i>

120
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,380
What’s that? Don’t you have a nickname?

121
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,730
Then Ed will give you one.

122
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,030
I know!

123
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,760
Because you’re a computer,
you can be MPU!

124
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,440
MPU! Cool name!

125
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,810
<i>Um…</i>

126
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,010
Ed is Edward Wong Hau
Pepelu Tivrusky the fourth.

127
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,410
Ed for short.

128
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,280
Nice to meet you!

129
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,740
Here. A souvenir from Earth.

130
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,210
Is this food?

131
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
It makes me doubt that
they have any sense.

132
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,380
Unlike you, I learned some information.

133
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,160
They said that an unknown hacker named
Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

134
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
It doesn’t mean anything
if he’s unknown.

135
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,260
I know, more or less.

136
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
It seems okay.

137
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,030
What kinda thing is it?

138
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,740
2 meters tall. Ex-basketball player.
Beautiful kid.

139
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,810
And on top of it, a gay alien.

140
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,180
Why did you doodle on Earth?

141
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,530
<i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>long before the Gate accident…</i>

142
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,490
<i>Earth was a beautiful planet</i>
<i>where many people lived.</i>

143
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,940
<i>And back then on Earth,</i>
<i>there were many…</i>

144
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,700
<i>…pictures like this,</i>
<i>and I always looked at them.</i>

145
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,080
<i>I remembered those times…</i>

146
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,840
<i>…and I tried to recreate</i>
<i>at least the pictures.</i>

147
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,090
I see, doodles like this were
on Earth long ago, too…

148
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,150
<i>Yes. I recreated them with</i>
<i>a 2% margin of error.</i>

149
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,290
MPU is good at drawing.
Can Ed draw something, too?

150
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,520
Huh? What’s wrong?

151
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,590
<i>This is…</i>

152
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,330
<i>The police are putting</i>
<i>out a jamming signal.</i>

153
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey! MPU! He-e-e-y!

154
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,870
Looks like the cops touched base
with Radical Edward as well.

155
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,110
<i>Listen! I found your bounty</i>

156
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,020
What the?

157
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,780
<i>Bebop!</i>

158
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,250
<i>The real culprit in the</i>
<i>satellite-jacking wasn’t a hacker!</i>

159
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,320
Since when do we have
an interactive channel?

160
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,830
No, that’s not it.

161
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,830
This is a real-time hack job.

162
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,330
Who is this kid?

163
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,700
<i>I’ll send you MPU’s data now.</i>

164
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,870
Wait a minute, what is MPU?

165
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,460
<i>A friend of Ed’s.</i>

166
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,670
Hey, do you know Ed?

167
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>Yeah, because Ed is Ed.</i>

168
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,750
I don’t care about that. Who did it?

169
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,650
<i>Um… I could tell you.</i>

170
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,750
<i>But I have a favor to ask in return.</i>

171
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,250
A favor?

172
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,390
Yeah, yeah.
Yer big sister will listen to ya later.

173
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,120
Come on, hurry it up.

174
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,890
I see. The A.I. from the abandoned
satellite is doodling of its own will.

175
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,230
What? What’s up?

176
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,240
And on top of that,
it was supposedly listed as…

177
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,370
…a weather satellite,
so nobody suspected anything.

178
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,310
Then this satellite is our bounty?

179
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,310
<i>Since the access code to</i>
<i>MPU can’t be used anymore…</i>

180
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,410
<i>…you need to go directly,</i>
<i>to the satellite.</i>

181
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,980
And what do we do?

182
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,650
<i>Break the antennae that it uses to</i>
<i>communicate with the other satellites.</i>

183
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,630
<i>Then make a direct connection</i>
<i>to the satellite and download MPU.</i>

184
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,190
<i>And when you do, don’t use computer</i>
<i>support for firing or flying.</i>

185
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,640
What? All manual?

186
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,040
<i>Yup. If it notices you,</i>
<i>all the attack satellites…</i>

187
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,200
<i>…connected to MPU will</i>
<i>automatically fire back.</i>

188
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,980
<i>Is this hard?</i>

189
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,210
It’s not just hard,
it’s downright impossible.

190
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,740
It’s like playing baseball with no bat!

191
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,790
Hey, Spike.

192
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,490
That’s the kind of stuff I like.

193
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,570
Hey! Wait, you.
How do you know about us?

194
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>I know everything.</i>

195
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,930
Last week, you let Ajiz, a bounty on
Mars worth 1.5 million, get away…

196
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,310
And in Pyortle before that,
the police got to them first…

197
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,310
Are you really that
hacker Radical Edward!?

198
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,750
Yeah. You’ve heard?

199
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,590
<i>Connect D-7 to #2. That way, the main</i>
<i>cannon will fire without a computer.</i>

200
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,930
I’m trusting you, man…

201
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,060
<i>Now listen. Avoid using the missile</i>
<i>if you can help it. It’s expensive.</i>

202
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,360
Roger.

203
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,530
<i>1200 to target.</i>

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,630
It’s almost time to
cut off computer controls.

205
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,610
Now, the only chance…

206
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,800
Once is enough.

207
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,520
<i>Anyway, you can prove</i>
<i>that the satellite itself…</i>

208
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,650
<i>…and not a hacker,</i>
<i>is the bounty, right?</i>

209
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,650
Ed can do that.

210
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,350
Anyway, please, listen to my favor.

211
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,760
Then I’ll give you all the bounty, too.

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,450
Oh, you’re a surprisingly good kid!

213
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,600
That’s it?

214
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,190
<i>Someone…</i>

215
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,500
How was it?

216
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,500
Did you get it?

217
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,460
No, I missed!

218
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,980
The satellite in front
of it shielded the blast!

219
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,180
Then you have to shoot
down all the satellites!

220
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,440
All of them!?

221
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,850
If you don’t, they’ll shoot us down!

222
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,290
ECM, eh?

223
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,760
Cheap ones are no good after all…

224
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,970
This is getting pointless.

225
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,140
<i>Approach to within 20 meters of MPU!</i>

226
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,120
<i>That way, the other</i>
<i>satellites can’t attack!</i>

227
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,140
However…

228
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,450
<i>Until then, Faye will act as a decoy.</i>

229
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,350
Me!?

230
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,850
Yeah, thanks!

231
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,820
Come on, hurry up!

232
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,050
All right, it’s all yours!

233
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,790
MPU!

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,570
MPU? MPU!?

235
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>Oh, Ed!</i>

236
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,930
<i>Ed, we meet again.</i>

237
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,670
They have a bounty on you, MPU.

238
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,970
<i>Bounty?</i>

239
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,710
Yup, but if we copy you and let
them catch that, you’ll be all right.

240
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,210
<i>All right?</i>

241
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,240
And you must be lonely
there alone, MPU.

242
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,310
If you come over here,
there are lots of friends.

243
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,850
<i>Friends?</i>

244
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,380
Here. It’s not scary.

245
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,170
<i>And so, the strange end to this case.</i>

246
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,070
<i>The captured criminal was</i>
<i>the A.I. program for…</i>

247
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,640
<i>…a spy satellite that was launched</i>
<i>before the Earth was ruined.</i>

248
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,110
<i>According to government sources</i>
<i>from back then, it supposedly would…</i>

249
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,710
<i>…continue activity on its own</i>
<i>even without commands from Earth.</i>

250
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,950
Well, it was the perfect excuse for
the cops to go on a hacker hunt.

251
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,000
But anyway, why did it start doodling on
the Earth with a laser all of a sudden?

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,060
I’m sure…

253
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,130
…that was because it got lonely.

254
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,400
Yoohoo! Bebop!

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,210
Hey, over here! Hurry!

256
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,470
<i>Promise, promise!</i>

257
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,850
Well, let’s get going now!

258
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,350
But the kid is saying
something about a promise…

259
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,080
Promises are made to be broken.

260
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,450
Anyway, let’s get going! Liftoff!

261
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,200
Not coming, not coming.

262
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,950
What is this? What’s going on!?

263
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,450
What did you promise?

264
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,100
It’s a promise…
to be a member of the Bebop.

265
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,530
<i>Amigo! All you bounty hunters!</i>

266
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,240
<i>It’s finally time for Big Shot!</i>

267
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
<i>Now, today’s hot news.</i>

268
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,810
<i>You’ve heard about the doodling</i>
<i>satellite that got caught, right?</i>

269
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,910
<i>Of course! It had a big bounty on it!</i>

270
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,060
<i>Just a few moments ago, the Earth</i>
<i>police made an official report.</i>

271
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,690
<i>What was it?</i>

272
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,100
<i>“This bounty is only for when humans</i>
<i>or other life forms are the targets.”</i>

273
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,170
<i>“It is difficult to determine whether or</i>
<i>not a computer program is a life form.”</i>

274
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,170
<i>“To begin with, from the viewpoint</i>
<i>of biological logistics</i>…”

275
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,740
<i>What’s that? I don’t understand well.</i>

276
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,410
<i>In other words, they can’t</i>
<i>pay up on nonliving things!</i>

277
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,420
<i>Oh, my</i>

278
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,750
<i>To those who caught it,</i>
<i>I feel sorry for you!</i>

279
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,790
Hey, Jet, did you know that there
are three things that I hate?

280
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,530
Whatever…

281
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,490
Rugrats…

282
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,630
…beasts…

283
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,490
…and tomboys.

284
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,500
Don’t give me that!

285
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,600
Why do we have all three
neatly gathered here!?

286
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,610
Ed loves Piyokos!

287
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,110
And once again we
didn’t get any bounty…

288
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,580
Hey, wait, you’re a girl?

289
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,380
Really, nothing good comes outta Earth!

290
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,170
COMING EPISODE

291
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,270
No regrets about the
woman who ran away…

292
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,670
…but a small thorn
still pricks the heart.

293
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,510
Letting one flow along
with time itself…

294
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,140
…living all alone from
that day to this.

295
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,550
But to the sounds of
waves that come and go…

296
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,140
…the migrating birds
find their hearts drawn.

297
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,680
Next episode: “Ganymede Elegy.”

298
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,190
Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.

299
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,750
GANYMEDE ELEGY
Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.

300
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,200
GANYMEDE ELEGY
