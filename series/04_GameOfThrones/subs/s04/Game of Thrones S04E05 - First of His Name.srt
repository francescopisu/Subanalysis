1
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:01,091
And protect him
in these perilous times.

2
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,593
May the Smith grant him strength

3
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,478
that he might bear
this heavy burden.

4
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:07,731
And may the Crone,

5
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:10,100
she that knows
the fate of all men,

6
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,736
show him the path he must walk

7
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,189
and guide him through the
dark places that lie ahead.

8
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,526
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

9
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:22,412
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name.

10
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:25,198
King of the Andals
and the First Men

11
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:28,084
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

12
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,089
Long may he reign!

13
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,125
Long may he reign!

14
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,886
Special day.

15
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,574
Your Grace.

16
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,411
Your Grace.

17
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:37,520
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

18
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,155
Your Grace.

19
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:00,176
There he is.

20
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,379
Long may he reign.

21
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,214
Long may he reign.

22
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,520
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

23
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:14,224
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

24
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:16,776
No, he wasn't.

25
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,701
You still mourn for Joffrey?

26
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,903
He was my husband.
My king.

27
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:29,072
He would have been
your nightmare.

28
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,328
Your Grace, I feel...

29
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,514
You knew exactly what he was.

30
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,133
I did, too.

31
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,618
You never love
anything in the world

32
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:44,054
the way you love
your first child.

33
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,258
Doesn't matter what they do.

34
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,680
And what he did, it shocked me.

35
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:58,268
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

36
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,702
No.

37
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:03,139
The things he did shocked me.

38
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,448
He's only a boy.

39
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,950
A good boy.
A decent boy.

40
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,869
He always has been.

41
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,089
<i>Who was the last
decent king, I wonder?</i>

42
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,007
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

43
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,793
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

44
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:27,931
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

45
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:31,000
For all the horror
that put him there.

46
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,241
He will need help...

47
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,611
if he's going to rule well.

48
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,613
He has you.

49
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:46,232
A mother is not enough.

50
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:50,820
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

51
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,655
Oh.

52
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,741
After all
that's happened...

53
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:00,830
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am...

54
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:03,299
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

55
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,084
what comes next.

56
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:08,338
It would be a great
honor, of course.

57
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,474
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

58
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:15,845
Yes, speak to your father.

59
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,765
I'll speak to mine.

60
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:26,906
We may be faced with an alarming
number of weddings soon.

61
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,693
I won't even know
what to call you.

62
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,530
Sister?

63
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,450
Or Mother?

64
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,003
Hmm.

65
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,573
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

66
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,026
Murdered at his own wedding.

67
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,430
<i>And we have taken the
Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.</i>

68
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,682
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese Navy.

69
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,717
Who told you to take the Navy?

70
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,886
No one.

71
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:59,389
So why did you do it?

72
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,441
I heard you liked ships.

73
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:07,063
How many ships?

74
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,364
93, Your Grace.

75
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,732
How many men can they carry?

76
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,652
9,300, not counting sailors.

77
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,621
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

78
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,489
The Lannisters have more.

79
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,908
<i>They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

80
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,743
They're tired, dispersed.

81
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:23,079
<i>And now their king is dead.</i>

82
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,716
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

83
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,252
<i>sailing into Blackwater Bay</i>

84
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,055
<i>and storming the gates
without warning.</i>

85
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,677
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

86
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:41,264
But we're not fighting to make
you queen of King's Landing.

87
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:44,267
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

88
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,969
The old houses
will flock to our queen

89
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,570
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

90
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:50,406
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

91
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,525
as they always have.

92
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:56,829
There's other news.

93
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,615
From Yunkai.

94
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,035
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

95
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,954
<i>the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.</i>

96
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,007
<i>They've reenslaved the
freedmen who stayed behind</i>

97
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,176
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

98
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,596
And in Astapor,

99
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:16,349
the council you installed
to rule over the city

100
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,469
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

101
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,855
<i>who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

102
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,809
Please leave me.

103
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,117
Not you, Jorah.

104
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,082
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

105
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,134
isn't going quite as planned.

106
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:55,054
You could sail for Westeros

107
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,090
and leave it all behind.

108
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,808
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

109
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:02,011
A boy many believe to be a
bastard with no right to it.

110
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,897
They've never been
more vulnerable.

111
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:08,351
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

112
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,987
I didn't listen.

113
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:13,156
That all worked out well.

114
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:22,782
How can I rule seven kingdoms

115
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,535
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

116
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:29,589
Why should anyone trust me?

117
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,208
Why should anyone follow me?

118
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,726
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

119
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,795
You're the Mother of Dragons.

120
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:40,216
I need to be more than that.

121
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:51,394
I will not let those I have
freed slide back into chains.

122
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,397
I will not sail for Westeros.

123
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,432
What, then?

124
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,336
I will do what queens do.

125
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,575
I will rule.

126
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:42,945
Pull up your hood.

127
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,283
A memorable shade.

128
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,169
But how would they know?

129
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:53,673
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

130
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:56,626
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

131
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,516
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

132
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,718
The mountains are impassable.

133
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,303
If you want to get to the Eyrie,

134
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,222
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

135
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:12,725
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

136
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,445
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

137
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,480
three men abreast

138
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,066
and get slaughtered like goats.

139
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:23,069
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

140
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,654
but they had these mountains

141
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,656
and they knew how to use them.

142
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:29,408
And the fortress they built
here has never been overcome.

143
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,211
Not once in 1,000 years.

144
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:34,997
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

145
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,417
and one man can be worth 10,000.

146
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,374
Who would
pass the Bloody Gate?

147
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,678
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

148
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,400
Stand to.

149
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:57,069
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

150
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,856
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

151
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:32,355
Uncle Petyr!

152
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,859
<i>My lord.</i>

153
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,567
Oh.

154
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:48,821
I have brought you a gift.

155
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,994
Lord Baelish.

156
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,747
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

157
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,416
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

158
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,135
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

159
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,670
My name is Al...

160
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,173
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

161
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:09,258
Don't you think know
who you are?

162
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,144
<i>You think I'd let my intended</i>

163
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,146
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

164
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:16,816
without knowing
what that business was?

165
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:22,154
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

166
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,194
My flesh and blood.

167
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,114
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

168
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,450
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

169
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:35,618
Of course.
I understand.

170
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,253
No one can know you're here.

171
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,372
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

172
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,007
I would never say a thing.

173
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,593
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

174
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,544
They've been trying for years.

175
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,630
<i>Now they know
what it feels like.</i>

176
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:51,467
Mummy said they killed your mother and
they chopped off your brother's head.

177
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,689
They did, and my father's.

178
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:59,308
They killed my father,
too, with poison.

179
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,446
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

180
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,648
but Mother said I couldn't.

181
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,483
Make him fly?

182
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,568
Through the Moon Door.

183
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:16,392
<i>And on top of
everything else,</i>

184
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:18,961
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

185
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,163
They did.
They made us both.

186
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:22,581
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

187
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,533
<i>I don't believe
that for a moment.</i>

188
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:26,585
Did he force himself on you?

189
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:28,337
No.

190
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:29,889
- We never...
<i>- Good.</i>

191
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:33,309
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

192
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,511
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

193
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,363
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

194
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,815
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

195
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,985
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

196
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,354
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

197
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:47,573
Take the back stairs.

198
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,528
Go.
We'll speak soon.

199
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,372
What took you so long?

200
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,375
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

201
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:10,046
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

202
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:13,883
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

203
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,104
Let's get married tonight.

204
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:20,439
Ought we not...

205
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,559
inform the Lords of the
Vale about the ceremony?

206
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,478
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

207
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,363
The others can all hang.

208
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:29,815
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

209
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:33,285
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

210
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,820
I do think that
we could wait until...

211
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:37,206
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

212
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,575
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

213
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,711
Or don't you remember?

214
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,714
Like it was yesterday.

215
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:48,918
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

216
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,804
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

217
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,673
When you gave me those drops

218
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:57,143
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

219
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,644
my husband's wine...

220
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:01,847
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

221
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,233
telling her it was
the Lannisters...

222
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,447
The deed is done.

223
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:21,117
Faded into nothing.

224
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:24,120
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

225
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:29,175
Tonight it is, then.

226
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,631
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

227
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:39,101
Once I'm presentable, I'll call
on the septon immediately.

228
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,027
I'm warning you.

229
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:52,148
I'm going to scream when my
husband makes love to me.

230
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,367
I'm going to scream so loud,

231
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:58,487
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

232
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:26,782
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

233
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,517
As soon as decency permits.

234
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:32,555
After we've allowed Tommen the
appropriate time to mourn his brother

235
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,324
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

236
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,827
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

237
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:40,863
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

238
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:44,200
no 77-course meals.

239
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:48,637
And your wedding to Loras?

240
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,257
Shortly after Tommen's.

241
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,676
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

242
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,962
I know you don't like them.

243
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,415
I didn't like your husband.

244
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,650
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

245
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,285
I didn't trust him.

246
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,321
We had that in common.

247
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:08,958
You don't need to make formal
alliances with people you trust.

248
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:11,610
Then whom can we trust?

249
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:15,397
Ourselves alone.

250
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,902
The Tyrells

251
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,571
are our only true rivals

252
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,323
in terms of resources

253
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:27,576
and we need them on our side.

254
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,045
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

255
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,299
Robert had me funding him.

256
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,585
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

257
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,972
I suppose that explains why we
did so well in the last one.

258
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:44,059
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

259
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,227
Haven't a clue.

260
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:46,929
Go on, your best guess.

261
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,765
Pounds, tons, ounces?

262
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,268
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

263
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,937
That can't be.

264
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:58,023
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

265
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:01,160
Then how do we pay for anything?

266
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,612
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

267
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,281
a tremendous amount of money.

268
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,916
How much?

269
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,085
A tremendous amount.

270
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,290
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

271
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,759
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

272
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,544
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

273
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,179
There is no someone.

274
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,798
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

275
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,934
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

276
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,886
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

277
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:32,558
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

278
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:36,195
That's what the Iron Bank is...
a temple.

279
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:39,448
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

280
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:42,985
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

281
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,754
You can't sway them
with excuses.

282
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,425
If you owe them money and you
don't want to crumble yourself,

283
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,910
you pay it back.

284
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,746
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

285
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,581
will help a great deal
in this respect.

286
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:59,435
It's for the good of the
family, I understand that.

287
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:05,090
I'm not sure my brothers do.

288
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:12,431
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

289
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:15,651
<i>And as a mother,
that is your right.</i>

290
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:20,189
But as a judge, I cannot
discuss the trial with you.

291
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:22,358
I respect that.

292
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,029
We don't need to discuss it.

293
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,002
The Lannister legacy is the
only thing that matters.

294
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:36,205
You've started wars
to protect this family.

295
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,540
Turned your back on Jaime

296
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,643
for refusing to
contribute to its future.

297
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:44,913
What does Tyrion deserve

298
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:47,499
for lighting
that future on fire?

299
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,445
<i>Joffrey.</i>

300
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:01,647
Cersei.

301
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,649
Walder Frey.

302
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,934
Meryn Trant.

303
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,771
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

304
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,906
The Red Woman.

305
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,292
Beric Dondarrion.

306
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:16,412
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

307
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,380
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

308
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,249
The Mountain.

309
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,217
Would you shut up?

310
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:25,637
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

311
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:29,308
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

312
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,177
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

313
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:36,598
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

314
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:39,184
Better than most.

315
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,738
We come across my brother,

316
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:46,241
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

317
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:52,030
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

318
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:01,957
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up

319
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,126
so I can get some sleep.

320
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:10,099
Go on, get it over with,

321
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,718
your list of doomed men.

322
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:16,855
I'm almost done.

323
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,024
Only one name left.

324
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,777
Go on.

325
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,653
The Hound.

326
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,962
Thank you.

327
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:42,047
Your mother always had a
sweet tooth, you know?

328
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:43,632
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

329
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,835
At suppertime, she would go
straight for honey cakes,

330
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:48,554
candied almonds, custard.

331
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,255
Anything sweet.

332
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,840
Eventually, your grandfather

333
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,426
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

334
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:57,012
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

335
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:59,014
It was important
that she remain desirable

336
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:00,682
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

337
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:03,402
and she was starting to get fat.

338
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:06,855
My mother fat?

339
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,076
She never let me have my pudding

340
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,861
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

341
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:16,281
This is before she married your
father and moved to the North.

342
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:19,918
By the time you were born, your
father's austerity had become hers.

343
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:23,005
Marriage changes people.

344
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,709
I didn't mean for you to stop.

345
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,545
Go on, enjoy them.

346
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,717
How do you like them?

347
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:37,769
They're delicious.

348
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:43,141
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

349
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:44,810
Oh, gods, no.

350
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,980
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

351
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:49,898
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

352
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,733
He's so kind.

353
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:53,735
He really cares for you.

354
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,705
Think where you'd
be without him.

355
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,074
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

356
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,128
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

357
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,746
He feels responsible for you.

358
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,381
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

359
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,250
Why?

360
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,086
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

361
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,006
Well, I'm half Tully.

362
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,592
- He loved your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

363
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:18,594
- No.
- That's what you wanted to say.

364
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,062
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

365
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:22,180
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

366
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:25,150
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

367
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:28,237
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

368
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:31,240
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

369
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:33,775
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

370
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:36,028
And your mother
loved him anyway.

371
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,698
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

372
00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:42,451
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

373
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:45,504
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

374
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,457
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

375
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:51,293
He hasn't told you about the vile
things they do with their bodies?

376
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:53,512
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

377
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:55,764
- <i>No, never.</i>
- Are you pregnant?

378
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,185
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

379
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,104
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

380
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:04,189
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

381
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:06,775
- Aunt Lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

382
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,478
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

383
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,814
You're hurting me.

384
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:14,316
I'll know if you lie.

385
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,152
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

386
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,987
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

387
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,989
All he says is that I'm stupid.

388
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,991
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

389
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,910
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

390
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:26,282
so I should always
tell the truth.

391
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,547
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

392
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:31,049
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

393
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,670
It's all right.

394
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,838
It will all be all right.

395
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:38,173
You'll be a widow soon.

396
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:40,592
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

397
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:42,844
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

398
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,013
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

399
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:47,432
Hmm.

400
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:11,707
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

401
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:15,260
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

402
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:17,295
There wasn't much call for
it with Lord Tyrion, though.

403
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:19,931
He preferred litters.

404
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,684
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

405
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,976
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

406
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:34,446
It could take weeks to get to the
Wall, depending on the weather.

407
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,148
That's a long way off.

408
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:39,151
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

409
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:41,737
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

410
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:44,322
Feel free to stop at any point.

411
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:47,242
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

412
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,828
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

413
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:51,296
I don't see why I need one now.

414
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,081
All knights have
squires, my lady.

415
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,416
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

416
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,586
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

417
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,755
I swore an oath, my lady.

418
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:02,307
I am releasing you
from that oath.

419
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,562
That means you could leave.

420
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:09,347
I know.

421
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,900
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

422
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:15,771
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

423
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:13,628
- The hell you doing?
- Practicing.

424
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:16,882
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

425
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,834
They will if you Nance
around like that.

426
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:21,336
That's no way to fight.

427
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:24,339
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

428
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,475
Dancing?

429
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:28,727
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

430
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,514
Who taught you that shite?

431
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:35,150
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

432
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,022
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

433
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:42,491
Braavos.</font>

434
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:44,359
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

435
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,744
They all are.

436
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,362
What do you know about anything?

437
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:49,531
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

438
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:51,583
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

439
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:52,534
- Yes.
- How?

440
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:54,452
- He was killed.
- Who by?

441
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:56,288
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn...

442
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:58,039
Meryn Trant?

443
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,259
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

444
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,261
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

445
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:05,213
could beat three Meryn Trants.

446
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:07,682
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

447
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:09,885
The greatest swordsman who ever
lived didn't have a sword?

448
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,222
All right.
You have a sword.

449
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:15,690
Let's see what he taught you.

450
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:18,560
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

451
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,813
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

452
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,578
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

453
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,330
'cause Trant had armor

454
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:40,715
and a big fucking sword.

455
00:30:10,947 --> 00:30:12,864
Your Grace.

456
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,584
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

457
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,370
A poem, actually.

458
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:21,623
May I show you the gardens?

459
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:24,759
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

460
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:26,962
No, you couldn't.

461
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,466
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

462
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:34,135
Not a very good one.

463
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:36,221
For your paramour?

464
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:38,607
For one of my daughters.

465
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:41,059
You have several, don't you?

466
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,444
Eight.

467
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,145
Eight?

468
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,448
Eight daughters?

469
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,316
The fifth is difficult.

470
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,986
I named her after
my sister Elia.

471
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:52,654
Beautiful name.

472
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:54,572
Yes.

473
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:57,659
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

474
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,629
And after I turn sad,

475
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,831
I grow angry.

476
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,583
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

477
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:08,720
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

478
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:11,006
Which joke is that?

479
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,425
You're a prince of Dorne.

480
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,677
A legendary fighter.

481
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:17,896
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

482
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,849
But you could not
save your sister.

483
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,319
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

484
00:31:24,353 --> 00:31:26,488
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

485
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:29,190
But I could not save my son.

486
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:31,660
What good is power

487
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:34,696
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

488
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:36,531
We can avenge them.

489
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,034
Yes, we can avenge them.

490
00:31:40,753 --> 00:31:43,254
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

491
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:46,508
I know he did.

492
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,995
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

493
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,381
We'll have a trial, anyway.

494
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:01,056
I haven't seen my
daughter in over a year.

495
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,058
The last time I saw her,

496
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,394
she was swimming with two of
my girls in the Water Gardens.

497
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:09,230
Laughing in the sun.

498
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,234
I want to believe that.

499
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:16,071
I want to believe she's happy.

500
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:18,707
You have my word.

501
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:21,576
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

502
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:26,047
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

503
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,225
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

504
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:40,895
<i>I wasn't there for her name day.</i>

505
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,264
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

506
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,734
Anything at all.

507
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:49,020
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

508
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:51,189
have been working
on it for months.

509
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,659
Myrcella loves the open water.

510
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:58,830
<i>I will have it sailed
down to Sunspear for her.</i>

511
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:02,217
Please tell her...

512
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,955
her mother misses her very much.

513
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:18,433
Oh, no, no, no.

514
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,385
No, no, no, no.

515
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,854
Hells.

516
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:28,026
Gods.

517
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,981
Did you remove the skin?

518
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,618
No, my lady.

519
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:38,620
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

520
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:40,989
No, my lady.

521
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,826
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

522
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,796
No, my lady.

523
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,547
That was the cooks.

524
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:08,266
What are you doing?

525
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:10,518
I'm helping you with your armor.

526
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:13,822
I've been removing my own armor for
quite some time, thank you very much.

527
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:34,259
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

528
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:37,846
I brought him his meals and cleared
his table when he was finished.

529
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,181
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

530
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:43,134
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

531
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:46,638
Mostly I poured wine.

532
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,690
Oh.

533
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,558
Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,

534
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:53,978
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

535
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:00,535
I killed a man.

536
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:05,740
Who?

537
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:07,792
A Kingsguard.

538
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,083
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

539
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,922
How did you kill a Kingsguard?

540
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:25,476
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

541
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:39,440
Bloody ridiculous.

542
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,779
Help me with these straps.

543
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:05,767
Hey.

544
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,802
Hey, get up.

545
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:11,773
Get up.</font>

546
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,647
<i>That's it lad,
put it inside.</i>

547
00:36:19,698 --> 00:36:21,649
<i>Get the fire going again.
We're all freezing.</i>

548
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,152
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

549
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:26,321
I've got to have a piss.

550
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,219
Now keep quiet.

551
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,045
You need water.

552
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,763
It doesn't matter.

553
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:28,816
Of course it matters.

554
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,088
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

555
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:38,726
They already have stopped me.

556
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,362
No.

557
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:45,933
You're not here.

558
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,908
You're far from here.

559
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:58,079
What does that mean?

560
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,170
At the hill.

561
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:08,840
A great weirwood tree.

562
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:13,811
You've seen it, too.

563
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:18,066
Meera and I, even Hodor,

564
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,735
we're only here to guide you.

565
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,307
He's waiting for you.

566
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:30,411
We have to find it.

567
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:34,082
You have to make it.

568
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:35,716
We will.

569
00:38:36,685 --> 00:38:40,238
This... this isn't
the end.

570
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:43,524
Not for you.

571
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,377
Not yet.

572
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:48,896
<i>How...</i>

573
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:51,632
will we know the end?

574
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,780
You'll know.

575
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:20,711
<i>Brothers.</i>

576
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:23,464
You do move quiet.

577
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:27,835
- How many?
- 11 men.

578
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:29,720
Most of them already drunk.

579
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,641
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

580
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,677
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

581
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:39,180
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

582
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:41,482
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

583
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:43,267
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

584
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:45,820
Not yet.

585
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:51,526
There's a hut on the West Side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

586
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:52,743
Why?

587
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:55,863
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

588
00:39:55,914 --> 00:39:59,033
Closer we can get without the
dogs sniffing us, the better.

589
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:02,870
New moon tonight.

590
00:40:04,873 --> 00:40:07,208
Get some rest.

591
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:09,877
We move at sundown.

592
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,182
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

593
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:16,350
A touch of class.

594
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:18,886
You take whatever's left.

595
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,474
Get her up.

596
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:26,861
<i>Stop.</i>

597
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:28,529
<i>Stop.
What are you doing?</i>

598
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,781
<i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

599
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:33,618
Stop.
Stop!

600
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:38,039
<i>- Hodor. Hodor.
- Stop!</i>

601
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:40,625
- Please.
- <i>Hodor.</i>

602
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,911
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor. Hodor.

603
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,247
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

604
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:51,219
<i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

605
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:54,505
- <i>What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hodor. Hodor.</i>

606
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:56,057
- <i>No!</i>
- Shh.

607
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:59,093
Shh, shh, shh.</font>

608
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:01,929
Shh.</font>

609
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,935
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

610
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:12,940
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

611
00:41:12,942 --> 00:41:15,910
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

612
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,332
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

613
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,618
No dresses for you.

614
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,121
You like it rough, don't you?

615
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:30,458
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

616
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:33,844
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

617
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,214
You can help me?

618
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:39,634
I can.

619
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,304
And how you gonna do that?

620
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:49,894
I have the sight.
I can see things.

621
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,812
That's very helpful.

622
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:54,065
Things that haven't
happened yet.

623
00:41:57,986 --> 00:41:59,954
What a fine thing.

624
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:04,875
A fine thing.

625
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:09,714
Have you seen what I'm
gonna do to your sister?

626
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:16,270
Have you seen what they're
going to do to your sister?

627
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,474
No.

628
00:42:22,394 --> 00:42:25,096
Don't close your eyes.

629
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:33,020
I saw you die tonight.

630
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,358
I saw your body burn.

631
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:41,862
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

632
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,284
<i>To arms!</i>

633
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:50,371
They're here, the Night's Watch.

634
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:21,902
Rescue party is here, lads.

635
00:43:21,904 --> 00:43:23,454
Lady.

636
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:26,123
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

637
00:43:26,158 --> 00:43:28,793
I'll take you to him.

638
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:33,881
You're Brandon Stark?

639
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:40,638
Hodor. Hodor.

640
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:43,340
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

641
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:45,176
Jon! Jon!

642
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:49,597
Keep talking and I'll cut
your friends' throats.

643
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:52,516
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

644
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,685
Do you hear?

645
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:09,333
<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

646
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:13,170
Hodor. Hodor.

647
00:44:13,205 --> 00:44:14,955
Hodor. Hodor.

648
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:20,177
<i>Hodor. Hodor.
Hodor.</i>

649
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:05,005
Hodor.

650
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:09,727
<i>Hodor, get his knife.
Cut me loose.</i>

651
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:13,931
- <i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
- Hodor.

652
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,485
Cut me loose, Hodor.

653
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:26,610
Jojen and Meera, free them.

654
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:28,362
<i>Go!</i>

655
00:45:31,116 --> 00:45:32,833
Jon.

656
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:44,545
Jon!

657
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,215
If he sees you, he won't
let you go north.

658
00:45:48,217 --> 00:45:51,268
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

659
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:54,138
<i>He'll take you back
to Castle Black.</i>

660
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:57,775
<i>You have to decide.</i>

661
00:45:57,809 --> 00:45:59,810
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

662
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,126
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

663
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:18,379
We need to free Summer.

664
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:21,048
And we need to go.

665
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,598
Lord Snow.

666
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,184
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

667
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,939
We had a good thing here.

668
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,858
We were free men.

669
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,027
You'll never be free.

670
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:52,446
You'll never know
what that's like.

671
00:47:13,602 --> 00:47:16,470
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

672
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,777
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

673
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:25,145
how to parry?

674
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:31,402
How to fight with honor?

675
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,300
You know what's
wrong with honor?

676
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:58,812
You.

677
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,763
Are you all right?

678
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,301
Come with me.

679
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:39,470
Come on.

680
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:58,372
We lost four brothers?

681
00:48:58,406 --> 00:49:00,407
Five.

682
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:06,213
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

683
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:10,667
I count 10 dead mutineers.

684
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,921
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

685
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,840
Where's Rast?

686
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:03,470
- Here's another.
- Jon.

687
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:08,442
<i>Where in seven hells?</i>

688
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:10,978
Come here.

689
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:20,537
I missed you, boy.

690
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,326
What should we do with this lot?

691
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,500
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

692
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:36,136
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

693
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:38,172
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

694
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:43,177
Come with us to Castle Black.

695
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:46,597
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

696
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:48,849
Meaning all respect, Ser Crow,

697
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,486
Craster beat us and worse.

698
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,989
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

699
00:50:56,024 --> 00:50:58,192
We'll find our own way.

700
00:50:58,194 --> 00:50:59,776
You want to stay here

701
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:01,945
in Craster's Keep?

702
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,118
Burn it to the ground

703
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:11,038
and all the dead with it.
