1
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:47,785
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that...

2
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:50,089
We've been here since midday.

3
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,215
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

4
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:06,218
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

5
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,886
Together, we were going to run

6
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,438
three shiploads
of the finest...

7
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,846
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

8
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:44,132
Please, sit.

9
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,235
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

10
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,236
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

11
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:13,506
<i>King of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

12
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,474
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

13
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,661
<i>The Iron Throne
is currently occupied</i>

14
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,582
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

15
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,115
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

16
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:29,033
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

17
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,753
He shares no blood with me.

18
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:35,172
He is a bastard born of incest.

19
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:37,257
<i>As was his brother before him.</i>

20
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:40,043
Yes, we have heard this story.

21
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:42,712
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

22
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:46,097
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

23
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,515
A story about a jealous uncle

24
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,750
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

25
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:55,722
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

26
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,472
Gold you loaned him.

27
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:01,710
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

28
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,362
More than any man living.

29
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:07,314
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

30
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,483
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

31
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,019
and "blood right."

32
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:16,187
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

33
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,406
We prefer the stories they tell.

34
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,357
More plain.

35
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:23,829
Less open to interpretation.

36
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,949
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

37
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,333
4,000.

38
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:32,335
<i>And how many ships do you have?</i>

39
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,636
<i>The ones still afloat,
Ser Davos,</i>

40
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,137
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

41
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,508
32.

42
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,310
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

43
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,676
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

44
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:49,465
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

45
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,485
None.

46
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,354
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

47
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,522
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

48
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:03,292
<i>I'm afraid we must respectfully</i>

49
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:06,377
<i>decline your request.</i>

50
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:09,530
<i>But we thank you for paying
us the honor of your visit.</i>

51
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,704
My lord.

52
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,458
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

53
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,625
You would not be either here.

54
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,577
In Braavos,

55
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,847
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

56
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,381
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

57
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,016
That would be the pirates.

58
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,434
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

59
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:39,972
This is the payment
that was demanded

60
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,306
by King Stannis for my crimes.

61
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,723
I consider it
an honest accounting.

62
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:46,226
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

63
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:48,729
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

64
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,532
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

65
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,898
The war is over.

66
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,401
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

67
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,403
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

68
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,570
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

69
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:03,206
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

70
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:06,643
- 67.
- 67. And when he dies, who's in command?

71
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,744
A half-grown boy,

72
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,081
<i>the product of incest?</i>

73
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:13,914
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

74
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,617
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

75
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,751
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

76
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,422
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

77
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:25,090
That is a problem
for another time.

78
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,393
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

79
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,562
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

80
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,397
Stannis.

81
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,265
He's got the birthright.

82
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,434
He's in his prime.

83
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,186
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

84
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,437
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

85
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,820
he does it.

86
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,943
<i>The lookout sees a
pirate ship sailing their way.</i>

87
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:51,945
<i>The captain shouts
to his first mate,</i>

88
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,831
"Bring me
my red shirt."

89
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,833
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

90
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,784
And when the pirates
try to board,

91
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:01,169
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

92
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:04,589
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

93
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,423
"Two pirate ships!"

94
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,260
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

95
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,261
But the courageous
captain hollers,

96
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,095
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

97
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,349
<i>After the battle,
the first mate asks,</i>

98
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,219
"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

99
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,802
The captain replies,

100
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:25,637
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

101
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,891
The next morning
the lookout screams,

102
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,392
"10 pirate ships!

103
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,227
"We are surrounded!"</font>

104
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,031
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

105
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,564
<i>They all look
to their brave captain,</i>

106
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,700
<i>waiting for his usual command.</i>

107
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,734
<i>Calm as ever,
the captain bellows...</i>

108
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:44,154
"Bring me my brown pants!"

109
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:50,460
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

110
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,911
Davos.</font>

111
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:56,331
I heard you were rotting in
a dungeon in Dragonstone.

112
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,666
Only half rotted.

113
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,385
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

114
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,338
This is Lhara.</font>

115
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,940
- And this is...
- I am Lhara.

116
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:13,644
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

117
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,013
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

118
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:18,481
We?

119
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,682
You, me... we.

120
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:26,021
Once I thought
this man loved me.

121
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:30,190
<i>Now I know he despises me.</i>

122
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:34,578
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold...

123
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,203
You won't be alone.

124
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,753
And you won't be poor.

125
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:58,129
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

126
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,047
I gave it to your wife.

127
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,718
You're not my friend, my friend.

128
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,354
I'll see you at sunrise.

129
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,609
"I give you
until the full moon"

130
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:18,227
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

131
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,948
<i>and back to those shit-stained
rocks you call home.</i>

132
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:23,982
On the first night
of the full moon,

133
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,784
I will hunt down every
islander still on our lands

134
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,736
and flay them living,

135
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,404
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

136
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:33,039
I found at Winterfell.

137
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,911
<i>In the box you'll find
a special gift...</i>

138
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,412
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

139
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:43,247
<i>He cried when I took
it away from him.</i>

140
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,418
<i>Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow</i>

141
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,587
<i>with more Theon.</i>

142
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,639
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

143
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:55,090
<i>natural born son
of Roose Bolton,</i>

144
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:57,091
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

145
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,060
<i>"and Warden of the North."</i>

146
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,064
Yes!

147
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:04,232
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

148
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,018
<i>and they mutilated my brother,</i>

149
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,402
<i>your prince.</i>

150
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,486
<i>Your prince.</i>

151
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,272
<i>Everything they've done to him,</i>

152
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,357
<i>they've also done to you.</i>

153
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,824
Yes! Yes!

154
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:21,777
<i>As long as they can hurt
our prince with impunity,</i>

155
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,783
<i>the word ironborn means nothing.</i>

156
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,636
Go left.

157
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:02,811
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know...

158
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,196
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.

159
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,565
Take me to the dungeons.

160
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:07,815
He's not in the dungeons.

161
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,336
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

162
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,839
<i>This way!</i>

163
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,236
We're going home.

164
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,987
No!

165
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:04,160
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

166
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,329
You can't trick me.

167
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,530
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

168
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:10,364
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

169
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,750
Not Theon! Reek!

170
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,535
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>- They're here.</i>

171
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:15,035
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

172
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:16,705
Help me with him.

173
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,621
No, you can't!

174
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,423
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

175
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:24,593
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

176
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:27,877
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

177
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,713
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

178
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:44,058
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

179
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:01,956
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

180
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,908
Loyal Reek!

181
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,330
Aah!
Theon!

182
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:32,812
Give me my broth You've got
bigger balls than he ever did.

183
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,565
But with those big balls
of yours...

184
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,739
how fast can you run?

185
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,216
Make for the ship, now.

186
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,917
But your brother.

187
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,919
My brother is dead.

188
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,393
I have a treat for you.

189
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,096
A reward.

190
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,680
Reward?

191
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:19,982
Yes, Reek.

192
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:22,934
Those creatures
who came in the night,

193
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:25,602
they wanted to take you away.

194
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:27,571
And you didn't let them.

195
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:30,008
You remained loyal.

196
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,945
I... I didn't want
them to take me.

197
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:36,696
I was so scared.

198
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:39,032
- I didn't want them...
- Yes, yes, Reek.

199
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,255
It's a bath.

200
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,624
For you.

201
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:58,347
Remove those rags.

202
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,383
Now.

203
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,981
The britches, too, Reek.

204
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:21,648
Take them off.

205
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,553
Do you love me, Reek?

206
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:59,059
Yes, of course, my lord.

207
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,312
Good.

208
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:04,696
Because I need you
to do something for me.

209
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,783
Something very important.

210
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:10,068
There's a castle, you see.

211
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,205
Some bad men hold this castle.

212
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,408
I need your help
to take this castle back.

213
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,710
But how can...

214
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,246
I need you to play a role.

215
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,335
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

216
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,089
Pretend to be who?

217
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,924
Theon Greyjoy.

218
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,795
He is a goatherd.

219
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,362
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

220
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,998
I thank him for his prayers.

221
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,496
It was your dragons, he says.

222
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:55,080
<i>They came this morning
for his flock.</i>

223
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,202
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

224
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:02,871
but now he has nothing.

225
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:06,090
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

226
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,942
<i>I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

227
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,798
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

228
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:33,395
Send the next one in.

229
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,056
Queen Daenerys.

230
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,142
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

231
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,227
I thank you.

232
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:16,263
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

233
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,931
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

234
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:21,901
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

235
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:24,904
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

236
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,241
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

237
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:28,789
This pyramid included.

238
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:30,991
For that, he has my gratitude.

239
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,692
I should be honored to meet him.

240
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,178
You have, Your Grace.

241
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:36,011
You crucified him.

242
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:40,282
I pray you'll never live to see

243
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,285
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

244
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:45,853
Your father crucified
innocent children.

245
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:49,339
My father spoke out against
crucifying those children.

246
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:52,575
He decried it as a criminal
act, but was overruled.

247
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,946
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

248
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:58,430
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

249
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,800
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

250
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,617
You'd be wise to remember that.

251
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,603
What's done is done.

252
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,773
You are the queen and I
am a servant of Meereen.

253
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:14,476
A servant who does not wish to
see its traditions eradicated.

254
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,311
And what traditions
do you speak of?

255
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,313
<i>The tradition of funeral rite.</i>

256
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,648
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

257
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:26,236
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

258
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,619
are still nailed to those posts,

259
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:31,823
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

260
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,883
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

261
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,134
so that they might receive
proper burials.

262
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,338
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

263
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,839
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

264
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,511
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

265
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:59,262
Your Grace, I cannot def end
the actions of the masters.

266
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:03,231
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

267
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,517
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

268
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,403
<i>Let me have him brought
to the temple</i>

269
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:09,937
and buried with dignity

270
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,356
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

271
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:19,243
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

272
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:26,251
Thank you, my queen.

273
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,226
How many more?

274
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,547
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

275
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:45,382
212?

276
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:55,358
Send the next one in.

277
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,976
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

278
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:03,112
I was up late last night.

279
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:07,151
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

280
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,067
Coins, ships?

281
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,320
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

282
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:14,571
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you...

283
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,576
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

284
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:24,080
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I...

285
00:25:24,082 --> 00:25:26,080
<i>The trial
begins this afternoon.</i>

286
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,299
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

287
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,801
Shall we begin?

288
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:31,835
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

289
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:34,670
in the Riverlands, my lord.

290
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,054
A coward and a traitor.

291
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:40,343
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

292
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:43,095
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

293
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,895
Disgraceful.

294
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,764
<i>What would it take
to make the common soldier</i>

295
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:49,066
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

296
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,669
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

297
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:54,522
Make it 100.
What else?

298
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:57,104
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

299
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,690
The Targaryen girl?

300
00:25:58,741 --> 00:26:01,526
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

301
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:05,177
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

302
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:06,781
Conquered with what?

303
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,747
<i>She commands an army
of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

304
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,783
Some 8,000 strong.

305
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:13,117
She has a company
of sellswords...

306
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,502
the Second Sons.

307
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:16,954
<i>She has two knights
advising her...</i>

308
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:20,257
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

309
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,293
And she has three dragons.

310
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:23,760
Baby dragons.

311
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:25,927
Larger every year, Your Grace.

312
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:29,431
Mormont is spying on her for us.

313
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:32,433
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

314
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,468
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

315
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:38,138
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

316
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,974
a bit harder than anticipated.

317
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:41,892
He's an old man.

318
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:43,843
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

319
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,894
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

320
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:49,229
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

321
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,383
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

322
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,985
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

323
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,238
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

324
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,322
Lord Varys is right.

325
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,826
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

326
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:07,394
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

327
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,163
Less so in the bedroom.

328
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,999
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

329
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,550
Armies win them all the time.

330
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,835
She must be dealt with.

331
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,886
How, my lord?

332
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,253
By force?

333
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:22,324
Eventually, if it comes to that.

334
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,428
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

335
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,480
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

336
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,432
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

337
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,182
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

338
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:57,251
Prince Oberyn.

339
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,702
Lord Varys...

340
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,940
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

341
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,508
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

342
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,374
And yet everyone does.

343
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,346
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

344
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,298
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

345
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:17,016
Five years.

346
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,635
May I ask why?

347
00:28:18,686 --> 00:28:21,521
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

348
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:24,221
Most of us live and die

349
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,941
in the same corner
where we were born

350
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:28,893
and never get to see any of it.

351
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:31,529
I don't want to be most of us.

352
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:33,563
Most of us aren't princes.

353
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:38,400
You are from Essos.

354
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,286
Where? Lys?

355
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,321
<i>I have an ear for accents.</i>

356
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,038
I've lost my accent entirely.

357
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,573
I have an ear for that as well.

358
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,628
<i>How did you get here?</i>

359
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,244
It's a long story.

360
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:56,247
One you don't like
telling people.

361
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,916
People I trust.

362
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:02,002
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

363
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:04,338
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

364
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:07,424
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

365
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:10,593
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

366
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:15,897
You did like boys before?

367
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:19,850
Really?

368
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,768
Girls? Hmm.

369
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,435
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

370
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:25,938
Not at all.

371
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,773
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

372
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:31,243
- What then?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

373
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:34,078
Everybody is interested
in something.

374
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,862
<i>Not me.</i>

375
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,115
When I see what
desire does to people,

376
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:40,083
what it's done to this country,

377
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:42,952
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

378
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:47,421
<i>Besides, the absence of desire</i>

379
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:50,543
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

380
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:52,257
Such as?

381
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:30,457
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

382
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,503
Really?

383
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,504
Father's orders.

384
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:55,342
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

385
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,685
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

386
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:56,808
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

387
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,558
<i>First of my Name,</i>

388
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:00,894
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

389
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:03,563
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

390
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:07,316
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

391
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:10,484
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

392
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:14,420
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

393
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,376
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

394
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,693
<i>and Lord Mace
of the House Tyrell.</i>

395
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:24,080
And if found guilty...

396
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,998
may the gods punish the accused.

397
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:05,997
Tyrion of the House Lannister,

398
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:10,117
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

399
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:13,785
Did you kill King Joffrey?

400
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,422
No.

401
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:18,790
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

402
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,257
Not that I know of.

403
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,593
How would you say he died, then?

404
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,796
Choked on his pigeon pie.

405
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:30,263
So you would blame the bakers?

406
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,684
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

407
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:38,638
The crown may call
its first witness.

408
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,807
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

409
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,808
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

410
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,143
He slapped the king
across the face

411
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:47,646
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

412
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:51,450
<i>It wasn't the first time
the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

413
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,368
Right here in this throne room,

414
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:56,286
he marched up those steps
and called our king a half wit.

415
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:58,621
<i>Compared His Grace
to the Mad King</i>

416
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:00,489
<i>and suggested he'd meet
the same fate.</i>

417
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,325
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

418
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,660
he threatened to have me killed.

419
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,711
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

420
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:09,547
<i>- Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

421
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,221
while you tore at her
clothes and beat her.

422
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,966
Silence!

423
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:17,885
You will not speak
unless called upon.

424
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,423
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

425
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:30,513
Basilisk venom,

426
00:34:30,564 --> 00:34:33,066
widow's blood,

427
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,350
wolfsbane,

428
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:37,568
essence of nightshade,

429
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:40,487
sweetsleep,

430
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:42,605
tears of Lys,

431
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:44,859
demon's dance...

432
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,611
blind eye...

433
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:50,863
I think you have made your
point, Grand Maester.

434
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:52,698
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

435
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,749
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

436
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:57,701
My stores were plundered.

437
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,034
By whom?

438
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:01,921
<i>By the accused,
Tyrion Lannister,</i>

439
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:04,375
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

440
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,875
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

441
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:09,927
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

442
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:14,267
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

443
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,849
Without question.

444
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:22,720
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

445
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:24,340
the king's fool.

446
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:28,391
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

447
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:32,196
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

448
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:35,649
She wore this necklace

449
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,901
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

450
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,202
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

451
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:45,207
and terrible poison
was found inside.

452
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:49,208
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

453
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:52,294
It was.
The Strangler.

454
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:56,164
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

455
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:00,802
And used to strike down
the most noble child

456
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:03,639
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

457
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:13,847
<i>I will hurt you for this.</i>

458
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,648
<i>A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy</i>

459
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:19,099
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

460
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:21,268
"and you will know
the debt is paid."

461
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,904
Your own brother
said this to you?

462
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:29,074
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

463
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:33,328
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

464
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,598
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

465
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,948
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

466
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,870
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

467
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,954
Tyrion said,

468
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,675
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

469
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,976
What debt?

470
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:54,962
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

471
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,795
in the Tower of the Hand.

472
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,298
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

473
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,968
<i>to the brothel
where such behavior belongs.</i>

474
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,936
He wasn't pleased.

475
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:08,689
Thank you, Your Grace,

476
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:11,023
for the courage
of your testimony.

477
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:29,072
<i>Do you remember the
precise nature of this threat?</i>

478
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,658
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

479
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,659
<i>"He said, " Perhaps you should
speak more softly to me, then.</i>

480
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,578
Monsters are dangerous

481
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:40,047
"and just now kings
are dying like flies."

482
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:43,385
And he said this to you at a
meeting of the small council?

483
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:44,666
Yes.

484
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:47,803
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

485
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:50,089
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

486
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,590
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

487
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:55,058
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern 'cause.

488
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:01,515
You're excused, Lord Varys.

489
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:06,602
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

490
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:14,357
One.

491
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,495
You once said

492
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,248
that without me, this city would
have faced certain defeat.

493
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:26,868
You said the histories
would never mention me,

494
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,536
but you would not forget.

495
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:33,505
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

496
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,126
Sadly, my lord,

497
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:40,878
I never forget a thing.

498
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:53,021
We will adjourn for now.

499
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,976
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

500
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:59,193
<i>Clear the court!</i>

501
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:21,628
<i>You'd condemn
your own son to death?</i>

502
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,829
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

503
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,379
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

504
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,716
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

505
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,169
I know nothing of the sort.

506
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,718
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

507
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:33,587
As did I.

508
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,173
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

509
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,074
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

510
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,595
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

511
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:44,396
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

512
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:47,598
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

513
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,684
If Tyrion is found guilty, he
will be punished accordingly.

514
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:53,303
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

515
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,909
Once you said family
is what lives on.

516
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,941
All that lives on.

517
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:04,446
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

518
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:07,362
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

519
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,282
I'm a Kingsguard,

520
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,201
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

521
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,953
I'm well aware of your oath.

522
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,087
What happens to your name?

523
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:19,458
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

524
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:21,460
Your nephews?

525
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,092
Lancel Lannister?

526
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,346
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

527
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,047
What happens to my dynasty

528
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:29,316
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

529
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,932
It survives through me.

530
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:36,303
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

531
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:39,140
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

532
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:42,025
if you let Tyrion live.

533
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,527
Done.

534
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:48,646
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

535
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,398
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

536
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:54,449
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow
him to join the Night's Watch.

537
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,989
<i>In three days' time, he'll
depart for Castle Black</i>

538
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,706
<i>and live out his days
at the Wall.</i>

539
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:03,324
<i>You'll remove your
white cloak immediately.</i>

540
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:05,326
<i>You will leave King's Landing</i>

541
00:41:05,377 --> 00:41:07,577
<i>to assume your rightful
place at Casterly Rock.</i>

542
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:10,049
You will marry a suitable woman

543
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:13,134
and father children
named Lannister.

544
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:17,052
And you'll never turn your
back on your family again.

545
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:23,673
You have my word.

546
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:25,510
And you have mine.

547
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:51,747
Not going well, is it?

548
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:54,250
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

549
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:57,036
When you are, you need to
enter a formal plea for mercy

550
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:59,336
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

551
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,338
Father's agreed to it.

552
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:04,090
He'll spare your life and allow
you to join the Night's Watch.

553
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,758
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

554
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,760
<i>and we both know
how that turned out.</i>

555
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,712
<i>Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.</i>

556
00:42:10,714 --> 00:42:12,546
How do you know?

557
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,268
Do you trust me?

558
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,807
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

559
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:25,890
This will all be over soon.

560
00:42:41,822 --> 00:42:44,741
The crown may call
its next witness.

561
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:21,267
State your name.

562
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:23,270
Shae.

563
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:25,488
Do you swear by all the gods

564
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:28,073
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

565
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,942
I swear it.

566
00:43:30,994 --> 00:43:32,778
Do you know this man?

567
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,688
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

568
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,536
How do you know him?

569
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:48,839
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

570
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:52,960
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

571
00:43:52,962 --> 00:43:55,178
What do you know of this?

572
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:59,098
I know that he's guilty.

573
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,517
He and Sansa
planned it together.

574
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:06,304
<i>Silence!</i>

575
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:08,856
<i>Continue.</i>

576
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,809
<i>She wanted revenge
for her father,</i>

577
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,311
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

578
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:16,144
<i>She blamed their deaths
on the king.</i>

579
00:44:16,146 --> 00:44:18,562
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

580
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:22,235
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

581
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:25,303
He hated you, my lord.

582
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:28,488
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

583
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,389
to put in Joffrey's wine.

584
00:44:30,423 --> 00:44:32,958
<i>How could you
possibly know all this?</i>

585
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:36,794
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

586
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:40,847
I wasn't just her maid.

587
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:45,334
I was his whore.

588
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:48,336
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

589
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:50,004
You said you were his...

590
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,891
His whore.

591
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:57,227
How did you come
to be in his service?

592
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,561
He stole me.

593
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,096
I was with another man,

594
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,681
a knight in
your lordship's army.

595
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:04,233
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

596
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:06,485
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

597
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:11,022
<i>He broke the knight's arm
and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

598
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:13,524
"You belong to me now," he said.

599
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:17,527
"I want you to fuck me like it's
my last night in this world."

600
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:22,998
Silence.
Silence!

601
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:25,917
And did you?

602
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:28,453
Did I what?

603
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:31,170
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

604
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,674
I did everything he wanted.

605
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:37,759
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

606
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,656
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

607
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:41,776
<i>I kissed him where he wanted.</i>

608
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:43,298
<i>I licked him where he wanted.</i>

609
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:46,732
<i>I let him put himself
where he wanted.</i>

610
00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:48,701
I was his property.

611
00:45:48,734 --> 00:45:50,954
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

612
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:52,821
so he could use me
when he was bored.

613
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:56,789
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

614
00:45:56,824 --> 00:46:00,494
I took his face
in my hands and said,

615
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:03,578
"I am yours
and you are mine."

616
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:08,834
Shae.

617
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:14,087
Please don't.

618
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,640
I am a whore.

619
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,261
<i>Remember?</i>

620
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:25,263
That was before
he married Sansa.

621
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:27,931
After that,
all he wanted was her.

622
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:30,517
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

623
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,770
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

624
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:48,613
I wish to confess.

625
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:53,117
I wish...
to confess.

626
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:57,788
You wish to confess?

627
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:01,290
I saved you.

628
00:47:03,044 --> 00:47:05,346
I saved this city

629
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:08,880
and all your worthless lives.

630
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:12,433
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

631
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:15,103
Tyrion.

632
00:47:17,972 --> 00:47:20,474
Do you wish to confess?

633
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:26,611
Yes, Father.

634
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:29,147
I'm guilty.

635
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:32,149
Guilty. Is that what
you want to hear?

636
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:34,284
You admit you poisoned the king?

637
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,869
No, of that I'm innocent.

638
00:47:36,903 --> 00:47:40,907
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

639
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,409
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

640
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:47,994
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

641
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,264
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

642
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:54,501
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

643
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:57,420
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

644
00:47:57,454 --> 00:47:58,853
<i>Nothing but this...</i>

645
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:01,840
I did not do it.

646
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:04,808
I did not kill Joffrey,

647
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:07,142
but I wish that I had.

648
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:10,012
<i>Watching your vicious
bastard die</i>

649
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:14,150
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

650
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:21,522
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

651
00:48:22,907 --> 00:48:26,492
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

652
00:48:26,526 --> 00:48:28,693
I would gladly give my life

653
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:31,030
to watch you all swallow it.

654
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:33,082
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.</font>

655
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:37,227
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

656
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:41,647
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

657
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:44,900
<i>And I know I'll get
no justice here.</i>

658
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:48,184
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

659
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:53,073
I demand a trial by combat.
