1
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:05,196
I want you to tell me the
truth about Joffrey.

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,872
He's a monster.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,448
The Tyrells beside us, no one will think
of rebelling for another century.

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,635
Ser Dontos of House Hollard.

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,770
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,640
It would be bad luck to kill
a man on your name day.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,160
You'll be my new fool!

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,432
Thank you, Your Grace.

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,976
Do you know what it takes
to unite 19 clans?

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,597
I told them we were
all going to die

11
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,350
if we don't get south.

12
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,828
Let us go, and my father will
pay you whatever you want.

13
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,736
Enough to buy me a new hand?

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,119
We need to find Sansa
Stark a husband.

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,641
Tyrion'll do as he's bid,
you'll marry Ser Loras.

16
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:57,472
- I am not some brood mare...
- You're my daughter!

17
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,857
My feelings for you
have not changed.

18
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,086
I'm not your lady,
I'm your whore.

19
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:04,336
He's a crow, he'll
stab us in the back.

20
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,712
Kill him!

21
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:11,971
That's a fine little blade.

22
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,735
- No!
- Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,700
- Something wrong with your leg, boy?
- You've got to carry me.

24
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:21,937
Robb!

25
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,020
The Lannisters send
their regards!

26
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:32,877
It's too late!

27
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:38,307
- You know I didn't have a choice...
- You know nothing, Jon Snow!

28
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,266
You're home.

29
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,712
- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,914
Looks fresh-forged.

31
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,348
It is.

32
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,485
No one's made a
Valyrian steel sword

33
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,087
since the Doom of Valyria.

34
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,822
There are three living smiths

35
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,024
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.

36
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,626
The finest of them
was in Volantis.

37
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,663
Came here to King's
Landing at my invitation.

38
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,898
Where did you get this
much Valyrian steel?

39
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,668
From someone who no
longer had need of it.

40
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,973
You've wanted one of these in
the family for a long time.

41
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,908
- And now we have two.
- Two?

42
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,478
The original weapon
was absurdly large.

43
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,880
Plenty of steel for two swords.

44
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:26,950
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.

45
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,824
You'll have to train
your left hand.

46
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,360
Any decent swordsman knows
how to use both hands.

47
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,429
You'll never be as good.

48
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,164
No.

49
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,958
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

50
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,634
I suppose it doesn't matter.

51
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,871
You can't serve in the
Kingsguard with one hand.

52
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:50,240
Where's that written?
I can and I will.

53
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,441
The Kingsguard
oath is for life.

54
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,643
The war is over.
The king is safe.

55
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,378
The king is never safe.

56
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,914
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

57
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,383
Other knights protected the
king while you were a prisoner.

58
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,319
They will continue to
do so when you go home.

59
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:06,823
- Home?
- You'll return to Casterly Rock

60
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,125
<i>and rule in my stead.</i>

61
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,327
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.

62
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,999
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.

63
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,569
I don't expect to see the
Rock again before I die.

64
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,138
You know what they call me?

65
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,440
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

66
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,109
Man without honor.

67
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,778
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.

68
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,381
You won't be breaking anything.

69
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,450
There is a precedent to relieve
a Kingsguard of his duties.

70
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:37,554
The king will exercise
that prerogative.

71
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,156
- No.
- No?

72
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,991
No.

73
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,370
I don't believe I
asked you a question.

74
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,201
There's my answer.

75
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:48,226
If you think your bloody
honor comes before...

76
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,333
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,

77
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,002
but my answer is still no. I
don't want Casterly Rock.

78
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,304
I don't want a wife. I
don't want children.

79
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:56,906
What do you want?

80
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,542
Supper would be nice.

81
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,947
For 40 years I've
tried to teach you.

82
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,216
If you haven't learned
by now, you never will.

83
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:08,384
Go.

84
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,386
<i>If serving as a
glorified bodyguard</i>

85
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,089
is the sum of your
ambition, go serve.

86
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:15,792
I suppose you want
the sword back.

87
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,994
Keep it.

88
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,863
A one-handed man
with no family needs

89
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,468
all the help he can get.

90
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:51,761
How many Dornishmen does
it take to fuck a goat?

91
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,830
Please don't.

92
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:56,966
<i>Seems to me
the smart place</i>

93
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,935
<i>to meet travelers
is in a tavern.</i>

94
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,803
That way, one party is late,

95
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,239
the other party can
drink some ale inside.

96
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:04,974
This is the Prince of
Dorne we're waiting for,

97
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,410
not one of your
sellsword friends.

98
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,647
If he's so damned important, how
come they sent you to meet him?

99
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,718
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne

100
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:18,388
and the Lannisters of Casterly
Rock. Has been for years.

101
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,657
And just in case the
Martells of Dorne

102
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,625
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,

103
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,061
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

104
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,587
I happen to be an
accomplished diplomat.

105
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,830
Oh.

106
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,700
Ah, here we are.

107
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,638
<i>Can you read the sigils?</i>

108
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,975
Yellow balls?

109
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,710
Wild lemons on a purple field,

110
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:43,046
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

111
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,483
A vulture grasping a baby in
it's talons, House Blackmont.

112
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,386
A crowned skull, the
Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

113
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,155
Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

114
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,723
I need a sigil.

115
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:57,327
And House Martell, a red
sun pierced by a spear?

116
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,828
I don't see it, my lord.

117
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:03,608
Well met, my lords.

118
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,999
His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

119
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:09,372
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

120
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,641
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

121
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,410
Master of Coin.

122
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:18,114
Forgive me.

123
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,767
I don't see Prince
Doran in your company.

124
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:25,021
The prince's health forces
him to remain at Sunspear.

125
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,191
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn

126
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:31,060
<i>to attend the royal
wedding in his stead.</i>

127
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,999
Yes, the king will be delighted
to enjoy the company

128
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,267
of a warrior as renowned
as Prince Oberyn

129
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,169
at his wedding feast.

130
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,270
Will he?

131
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:44,273
And where is Prince Oberyn?

132
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,708
Arrived before dawn.

133
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:48,344
Not a man for welcome parties,

134
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,313
<i>our prince.</i>

135
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:54,017
Very well. My lords, these
fine men from the City Watch

136
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,586
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.

137
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,722
You must be weary after
such a long journey.

138
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,763
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.

139
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,464
Now where?

140
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,812
We must find Prince Oberyn
before he kills somebody

141
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,468
or several somebodies.

142
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,571
How do you plan on finding a single
Dornishman in a city this big?

143
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,740
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.

144
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,810
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad roads,

145
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:22,278
where would you go?

146
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,448
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

147
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,541
Look at this one.

148
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:55,111
How lovely is she?

149
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,013
Beautiful.

150
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,781
But pale.

151
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,783
They like them pale
in the capital.

152
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,386
Shows they don't
work the fields.

153
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,057
Do I frighten you?

154
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,260
You like?

155
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,497
Timid. Timid bores me.

156
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:23,039
You're a bit of
mischief, aren't you?

157
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,210
I think she likes you.

158
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,911
She has good taste.

159
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:33,783
You're not timid, are you?

160
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,922
<font color="#808080">Not timid.

161
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,791
Do you like women?

162
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,759
When they look
like her, my lord.

163
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,995
This one will do nicely.

164
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,064
Very good, my lady.

165
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,333
Oh, I'm not a lady.

166
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,635
A term of courtesy in
this establishment.

167
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,537
A lie anywhere.

168
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:56,973
Why not use the right words?

169
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,608
I'm a bastard.

170
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:02,311
She is a whore.
And you're what?

171
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,480
A procurer.

172
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,115
Any of the others?

173
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:09,886
The two girls can leave.

174
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,854
<font color="#808080">You stay.

175
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,458
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.

176
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:18,528
Everyone who works for
Littlefinger is an offer.

177
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:21,330
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

178
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:24,500
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

179
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,303
Have you ever been
with a prince?

180
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,506
Can't say I have.

181
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:36,512
I'm wildly expensive.

182
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,116
Take off your clothes.

183
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,258
Which way do you like it?

184
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,296
<font color="#808080">My way.

Forgive me for staring.

194
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,473
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.

195
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,243
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.

196
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,579
We don't like the smell.</font>

197
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,349
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

198
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:48,684
Sirs, if you follow me, I'll
arrange for a private room.

199
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,987
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?

200
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,122
Bring him a shaved goat and
a bottle of olive oil.

201
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:01,631
Do you know why all the
world hates a Lannister?

202
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:10,940
You think your gold
and your lions

203
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:14,477
and your gold lions make
you better than everyone.

204
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,981
May I tell you a secret?

205
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:21,450
You're not a golden lion.

206
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,020
You're just a pink little man

207
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,389
who is far too
slow on the draw.

208
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:38,701
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

209
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,003
When I pull my blade, your
friend starts bleeding.

210
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,673
Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So
many veins in the wrist.

211
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:47,977
He'll live if you get
him help straightaway.

212
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,648
So, decisions.

213
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,085
Prince Oberyn, forgive
the intrusion.

214
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,087
We heard there might be...</font>

215
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,222
trouble.

216
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:03,526
Apologies, my love.

217
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,734
I'm here to welcome
you to the capital.

218
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:19,108
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

219
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,078
The king's own Uncle Imp.

220
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:25,014
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

221
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,682
If there's anything I can
do to make your stay...

222
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,484
What are you? His
hired killer?

223
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,954
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

224
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,255
How did that come to pass?

225
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,624
Killed the right
people, I suppose.

226
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:43,466
We'll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?

227
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,867
You don't partake?

228
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,603
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.

229
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,973
Prince Oberyn, if I
may, a word in private?

230
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,713
Seems I visited the Lannister
brothel by mistake.

231
00:16:57,748 --> 00:17:00,216
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

232
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,411
The king is very grateful
that you traveled all

233
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,886
this way for his wedding.

234
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,856
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

235
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,892
I am only the second
son after all.

236
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,961
Well, speaking as a
fellow second son,

237
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,331
I have grown rather used to
being the family insult.

238
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,868
Why did you come to King's
Landing, Prince Oberyn?

239
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,369
I was invited to
the royal wedding.

240
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:23,005
I thought we were
speaking truth.

241
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,276
The last time I was in the
capital was many years ago.

242
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,345
Another wedding.

243
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,514
My sister Elia

244
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:35,017
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

245
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,823
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

246
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:44,493
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

247
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:47,530
Elia wouldn't let the
wet nurse touch them.

248
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,100
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen

249
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:53,936
left her for another woman.

250
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,138
That started a war

251
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,941
and the war ended right here

252
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,243
when your father's
army took the city...

253
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,645
I wasn't actually present.

254
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,014
And butchered those children.

255
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,417
My nephew and niece.

256
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:12,588
Carved them up and wrapped
them in Lannister cloaks.

257
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:17,960
And my sister, you know
what they did to her?

258
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,531
I'm asking you a question.

259
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,700
I've heard rumors.

260
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:27,369
<font color="#808080">So have I.

261
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:31,340
The one I keep hearing is that
Gregor Clegane the Mountain

262
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:34,310
raped Elia and
split her in half

263
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,678
with his great sword.

264
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,613
I wasn't there. I don't
know what happened.

265
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,348
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

266
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:41,617
your father gave the order.

267
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,887
Tell your father I'm here.

268
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:50,192
And tell him the Lannisters aren't
the only ones who pay their debts.

269
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:21,090
<font color="#808080">Shh.

270
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,189
Shh. Shh.

271
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,510
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

272
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:17,346
They can never be tamed.

273
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,082
Not even by their mother.

274
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,405
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.

275
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,742
Where's Daario Naharis?

276
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,510
Where's Grey Worm?

277
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,414
Gambling, Your Grace.

278
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,484
Gambling?

279
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:20,976
Mhysa. Mhysa.
Mhysa...

280
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,553
How long have they been at it?

281
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:33,856
Since midnight, Your Grace.

282
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,525
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.

283
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,427
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.

284
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,829
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?

285
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,998
The honor of riding by your
side on the road to Meereen.

286
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,602
That honor goes to Ser
Jorah and Ser Barristan

287
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,971
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.

288
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,541
You two will ride in the rear
guard and protect the livestock.

289
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,311
The last man holding his sword

290
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,881
can find a new queen
to fight for.

291
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,878
You need to eat something.

292
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,050
Pigeon pie.

293
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,319
No, thank you.

294
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,292
Lemon cakes?

295
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:45,027
No, thank you.

296
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,929
You love lemon cakes.

297
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,732
Tell her she needs to eat.

298
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:51,500
My lady, you do need to eat.

299
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:53,469
I don't need to eat.

300
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:58,574
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

301
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,985
She needs to eat.

302
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,194
I can't let you starve.

303
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,163
<i>I swore to protect you.</i>

304
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,038
My lady,

305
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:32,374
I am your husband.
Let me help you.

306
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,311
How can you help me?

307
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:38,981
I don't know, but I can try.

308
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,987
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

309
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,856
thinking about how they died.

310
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:51,226
I could get you essence of
nightshade to help you sleep.

311
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,428
Do you know what they
did to my brother?

312
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:58,801
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?

313
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,271
And my mother.

314
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,873
They say they cut her
throat to the bone

315
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:08,010
and threw her body
in the river.

316
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,047
<i>What happened to your family
was a terrible crime.</i>

317
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,346
I didn't know your brother.

318
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,372
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

319
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,387
<i>Your mother, on
the other hand,</i>

320
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,422
<i>I admired her.</i>

321
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,658
She wanted to have me executed,

322
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,693
but I admired her.

323
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,463
She was a strong woman.

324
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,599
And she was fierce

325
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,801
when it came to
protecting her children.

326
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,306
Sansa.

327
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,877
Your mother would
want you to carry on.

328
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,245
You know it's true.

329
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:49,985
Will you pardon me, my lord?

330
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,587
I'd like to visit the godswood.

331
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,723
Of course. Of course. Prayer
can be helpful, I hear.

332
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:57,459
I don't pray anymore.

333
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:01,063
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

334
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,516
My lion.

335
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:24,052
What are you doing?

336
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:30,459
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.

337
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:33,161
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

338
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,830
I know. I know.

339
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:37,132
We have come to a
dangerous place.

340
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,635
Have you forgotten me? Do you
know how long it's been?

341
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,969
Of course I haven't forgotten.

342
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:43,305
I want you.

343
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,806
Don't you want me?

344
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,877
Things are a bit
tense right now.

345
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:51,046
What things?

346
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,148
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.

347
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,817
My wife hates me because my
father murdered her family.

348
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,697
Oberyn Martell wants to
murder everyone whose

349
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,321
last name is Lannister.

350
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:03,825
You need to relax.

351
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,603
Don't you want to relax?

352
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,010
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

353
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:24,513
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

354
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:27,616
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

355
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,218
- Do you love her?
- Love her?

356
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,421
I barely know her.
She's a child.

357
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:35,090
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.

358
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:37,326
Of course I don't love her.

359
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,394
You tried to ship me away.

360
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,530
Ship you away?

361
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:45,367
Give me diamonds and
make me disappear.

362
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,235
What in the world are
you talking about?

363
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,171
If you want me to
leave, just say it.

364
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,975
- Say it!
- Shh.

365
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:55,077
I don't know what
you're talking about.

366
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,746
You want me to stay?

367
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:28,377
A work of art, really.

368
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,245
The craftsmanship is excellent.

369
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,673
You like it so much,

370
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:33,660
you're welcome to chop off
your own hand and take it.

371
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,650
Such an ingrate. I spent
days with the goldsmith

372
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:38,286
- getting the details just right.
- Days?

373
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:41,222
Better part of an afternoon.

374
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:43,892
There, how does that feel?

375
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:45,760
Uh...

376
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,029
a hook would be more practical.

377
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:49,931
Elegant, I think.

378
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,681
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

379
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:59,874
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

380
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,409
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.

381
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,778
Not a maester, Your
Grace, but happy to help

382
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,680
whenever I can.

383
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,291
Odd little man.

384
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:18,293
I've grown rather fond of him.</font>

385
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:20,228
He's quite talented, you know?

386
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,896
What symptoms?

387
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:24,265
Symptoms that are
not your concern.

388
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,534
You let him touch you?

389
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,736
You jealous?

390
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:30,471
I'm surprised.

391
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:31,906
You never let Pycelle near you.

392
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:34,075
<font color="#808080"></font> You think I'd let
that old lecher

393
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,344
put his hands on me?

394
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,947
He smells like a dead cat.

395
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:41,349
<i>I'm not sure I've ever
smelled a dead cat.</i>

396
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,585
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

397
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,321
You drink more
than you used to.

398
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,389
- Yes.
- Why?

399
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:52,660
Let's see, you started a brawl
in the streets with Ned Stark

400
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,796
and disappeared
from the capital.

401
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,365
My husband died in a
tragic hunting accident.

402
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,100
It must have been
traumatic for you.

403
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,535
My only daughter was
shipped off to Dorne.

404
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,203
<i>We suffered through a siege.</i>

405
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:03,871
A rather short siege.

406
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:06,240
A rather short siege that I
didn't expect to survive.

407
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:08,209
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son

408
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,378
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden

409
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:12,513
while I'm supposed to
marry her brother,

410
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,149
a renowned pillow biter. So...

411
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,752
Father disowned me today.

412
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:20,154
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.

413
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,657
You're forgetting Tyrion.

414
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:26,427
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

415
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,935
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

416
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,304
in the Red Keep with you.

417
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:39,607
- Not now.
- I want...

418
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:42,844
Not now? When? I've
been back for weeks.

419
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,550
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

420
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:52,553
You come back after all
this time with no apologies

421
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,089
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?

422
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,424
What do you want me
to apologize for?

423
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,892
For leaving me.

424
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,427
You think I wanted to
be taken prisoner?

425
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:01,362
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

426
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,931
You left me alone.

427
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:07,568
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

428
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:10,905
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

429
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,508
- You took too long.
- I...

430
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,578
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.

431
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,915
- Come in.
<i>- Go away.</i>

432
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,151
Forgive me, Your Grace.

433
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:26,754
You told me to come at once if
there was anything important.

434
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:49,143
You plan on killing all
the crows yourself?

435
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,881
Do you plan on sitting here
scratching your balls till winter?

436
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,917
We wait for Mance's orders.

437
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:57,952
You sent a man over the
Wall at the full moon.

438
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,921
<i>If he's not back yet,
he's not coming back.</i>

439
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:01,456
<i>And what is it you want?</i>

440
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,958
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?

441
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,994
Your pretty crow said 1,000
men are nesting there.

442
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,763
Yeah, well, he's a liar.

443
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:10,498
He is?

444
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,867
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

445
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,670
You said you put
three arrows in him.

446
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:17,338
I did.

447
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:20,942
I've seen you slip a shaft through
a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

448
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:25,346
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.

449
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:52,306
Thenns.

450
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,842
I fucking hate Thenns.

451
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:06,921
Mance sent you?

452
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:09,390
<font color="#808080">How did you find us?

453
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:16,831
You came from the
south, not the north.

454
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,200
Took a detour.

455
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:22,670
Got some supper from a
village down that way.

456
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,742
<i>Why does the meat down
here taste so much better</i>

457
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:29,944
than it does on our
side of the Wall?

458
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,646
Help yourself.

459
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:37,318
Maybe everything's just
better fed down here.

460
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:40,688
Fat and lazy.

461
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,991
Easier for us, hmm?

462
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,462
You didn't see us coming?

463
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,264
Lost your warg?

464
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:55,203
And that baby crow
you had with you,

465
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:57,605
lost him too?

466
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,742
I'll answer to Mance.

467
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:03,778
I won't answer to you.

468
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:06,447
She yours?

469
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,585
I'm not anybody's.

470
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:21,729
Too scrawny.

471
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:25,399
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

472
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:29,170
<i>Think of them stuck
in their larders</i>

473
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:32,340
stuffing their faces with
ham and blood sausage

474
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:35,910
and stew, getting nice and fat

475
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,612
and marbled.

476
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:41,549
I know we've had our
differences, Tormund,

477
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,920
but just one time
before you die,

478
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:50,124
you really ought to try crow.

479
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,695
Draw.

480
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,631
Loose.

481
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,705
Last time I saw him,

482
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,008
<i>he was in the courtyard
at Winterfell.</i>

483
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,445
<i>"He said, " Next
time I see you,</i>

484
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,348
<i>you'll be all in black."</i>

485
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:19,120
I was jealous of
Robb my whole life.

486
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,623
<i>The way my father
looked at him,</i>

487
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,625
<i>I wanted that.</i>

488
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,795
He was better than
me at everything...

489
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,366
fighting and hunting

490
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,002
and riding

491
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,837
and girls.

492
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:39,907
<i>Gods, the girls loved him.</i>

493
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:44,211
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.

494
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:49,383
Sometimes I want to hate you.

495
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:55,189
Well, you're better
than me at everything.

496
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,793
Except reading.

497
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:05,099
They're... they're
ready for you.

498
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,973
He's wanted to hang me for
a while. Now's his chance.

499
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,307
No one's going to hang you.

500
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,809
You've done nothing wrong.

501
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:17,712
I've done plenty wrong.

502
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:22,283
So you admit you murdered
Qhorin Halfhand?

503
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,051
I didn't murder him.

504
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:26,554
No? You put your sword

505
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:28,522
through a brother of
the Night's Watch.

506
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:30,591
What do you call that?

507
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,727
He wanted me to kill him.

508
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,562
A bastard son of a traitor.

509
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:35,997
What would you expect?

510
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,932
The Halfhand believed
our only chance

511
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,234
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.

512
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,299
Don't talk about the
Halfhand as if you knew him.

513
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,523
He was my brother.

514
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:46,374
Then you'd know he'd do
anything to defend the Wall.

515
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,210
The free folk would have boiled him
alive, but letting me kill him...

516
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:51,379
<i>The free folk?
Listen to him.</i>

517
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,948
He even talks like
a wildling now.

518
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:56,717
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

519
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:59,353
I climbed the Wall with
the wildlings. I...

520
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:02,823
I laid with a wildling girl.

521
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,528
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?

522
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:09,830
I do.

523
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:13,801
The law is the law.
The boy must die.

524
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:17,972
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

525
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:21,742
the Wall would be
manned by headless men.

526
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,911
There's a difference
between sneaking off

527
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:27,748
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.

528
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,217
While we sit here

529
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:32,686
debating which rules I broke,

530
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:36,257
Mance Rayder marches on the
Wall with an army of 100,000.

531
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,691
Impossible.

532
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,894
You can't get 50
wildlings together

533
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:41,429
before they start
killing each other.

534
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:44,832
100,000. He's
united the Thenns,

535
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,467
<i>the Hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.</i>

536
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,968
He has giants fighting for him.

537
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,071
<font color="#808080">Giants?

538
00:36:51,273 --> 00:36:53,507
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

539
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,676
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

540
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,606
And now you're here.

541
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,546
You must not have been
very good at your job.

542
00:36:58,547 --> 00:36:59,747
How dare you?!

543
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,883
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already

544
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,952
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

545
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:06,687
I killed their warg
and three others.

546
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,023
They shot me full of arrows.

547
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,660
Their orders are to attack
Castle Black from the south

548
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,995
when Mance hits it
from the north.

549
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,531
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

550
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,900
Mance said it would
be the greatest fire

551
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,335
the North has ever seen.

552
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,004
<i>That's the truth.</i>

553
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,773
All the truth.

554
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:33,614
Do you intend to execute
me or am I free to go?

555
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,950
None of us are free.

556
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:37,818
We are men of the
Night's Watch.

557
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:42,156
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.

558
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,724
Go on.

559
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,937
I am acting commander
here, Maester Aemon.

560
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,839
Yes, you are.

561
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,741
And I don't trust the bastard.

562
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:03,811
He told the truth.

563
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:06,013
And you always know when
a man's telling a lie?

564
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,382
How did you acquire
this magical power?

565
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,953
I grew up in King's Landing.

566
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,325
No. No.

567
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,061
You're a queen, not an ox.

568
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:24,398
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace

569
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,801
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.

570
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:31,438
The wedding is in a
fortnight, Grandmother.

571
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:33,507
You can't say no to everything.

572
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,177
Nonsense. My little dears.

573
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:39,180
Go and speak to the
jewelers of King's Landing.

574
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,782
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

575
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,984
The one who brings
me the best necklace

576
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,654
will get to keep the next best.

577
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:53,694
The Margaery Tyrell who
walks into the sept

578
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:57,231
a fortnight from now will
inspire 1,000 songs.

579
00:38:57,265 --> 00:39:00,701
Now, how sad it will be if she's
wearing rubbish like that.

580
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:04,171
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.

581
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,487
End up with a string of dead
sparrow heads around my neck.

582
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:10,077
You watch that. Even
here, even with me.

583
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,148
My word.

584
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,850
My lady. My lady.

585
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,853
Please pardon me
for interrupting.

586
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,689
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

587
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:23,357
We know who you are. We've
heard all about you.

588
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,926
But hearing is one thing.

589
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,629
Aren't you just marvelous?

590
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:31,966
Absolutely singular.

591
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,568
I hear you knocked my
grandson into the dirt

592
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:37,805
like the silly
little boy he is.

593
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,241
My lady, I know this is a
very busy time for you,

594
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:42,977
but if I could just
have a moment.

595
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:46,013
You dare not refuse.

596
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,117
A shadow?

597
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,753
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

598
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:58,058
I swear to you by all the
gods it was Stannis.

599
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:00,828
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart

600
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:03,364
and disappeared.

601
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:06,300
One day, my lady, I
will avenge our king.

602
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:08,636
Joffrey is our king now.

603
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,838
I meant no offense.

604
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:12,740
And you've given none.

605
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,251
All the Kingsguard will
be on duty, of course.

606
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,086
Ser Boros will be
stationed here.

607
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:28,088
Ser Preston will
be stationed here

608
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:31,692
beside the primary
entertainment.

609
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,095
Your Grace?

610
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,698
Yes, yes, one guard at the...

611
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,533
the thing. Go on.

612
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,770
Ser Meryn will guard Lady
Margaery and Tommen.

613
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:45,439
I've always guarded the
king himself, my lord.

614
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:47,675
Ever since your absence.

615
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,777
And I thank you for
it, Ser Meryn.

616
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:52,513
All very good. I don't
expect any trouble.

617
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,315
The people love their king.

618
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,849
They know who keeps them fed.

619
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:57,885
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

620
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:00,888
By my leave.

621
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:04,091
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

622
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,093
The war's not won. Not
while Stannis lives.

623
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,495
I broke Stannis on
the Blackwater.

624
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,931
Pity you weren't there
to help, Uncle.

625
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,701
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

626
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:15,936
Busy getting captured.

627
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,973
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?

628
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:22,976
All the great deeds of all
the great Kingsguard.

629
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,083
Ser Arthur Dayne. The
Sword of the Morning.

630
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:34,121
Led the attack on the
Kingswood Brotherhood.

631
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,490
Defeated the Smiling
Knight in single combat.

632
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,259
Ser Duncan the Tall.

633
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,697
Four pages for Ser Duncan.

634
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,299
He must have been quite a man.

635
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,167
So they say.

636
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:51,672
Ser Jaime Lannister.

637
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,746
Someone forgot to write
down all your great deeds.

638
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,715
- There's still time.
- Is there?

639
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,918
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

640
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,122
How can you protect
me with that?

641
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,723
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

642
00:42:09,758 --> 00:42:11,992
Makes for more of a contest.

643
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:31,678
Have you ever been
to Meereen?

644
00:42:31,713 --> 00:42:34,148
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

645
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:35,582
And?

646
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:37,785
They say 1,000 slaves died

647
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,620
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

648
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:41,889
And now an army
of former slaves

649
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:44,291
is marching to her gates.

650
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:46,527
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

651
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,530
If they're smart, Your Grace.

652
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,536
You were told to ride at
the back of the train.

653
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,304
Yes, my queen.

654
00:42:57,338 --> 00:43:00,107
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

655
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:03,076
A matter of strategy.

656
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,615
Your Grace.

657
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,822
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?

658
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:19,793
A dusk rose.

659
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:22,229
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

660
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:25,265
And this one's
called lady's lace.

661
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,367
Would you like to
walk without shoes?

662
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:29,636
You have to know a
land to rule it.

663
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:31,772
It's plants, it's rivers,

664
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:34,508
it's roads, it's people.

665
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,910
Dusk rose tea eases fever.

666
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,679
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

667
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,014
Especially the slaves who
have to make the tea.

668
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,549
If you want them to follow you,

669
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:44,218
you have to become a
part of their world.

670
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:45,619
Strategy.

671
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:50,457
Harpy's Gold.

672
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:52,092
No tea from this one.

673
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:54,394
Beautiful but poisonous.

674
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:02,936
You are a gambler, aren't you?

675
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:12,613
Your Grace.

676
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:47,481
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

677
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:50,817
How many miles are there
between here and Meereen?

678
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:54,254
163, Your Grace.

679
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:56,423
<i>I'll tell our men to ride
ahead and bury them.</i>

680
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:57,958
You don't need to see this.

681
00:44:57,992 --> 00:45:01,061
You will do no such thing.

682
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:04,798
I will see each and every
one of their faces.

683
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:09,069
Remove her collar
before you bury her.

684
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:17,744
There she is.

685
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:20,113
Yes, there she is.

686
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:24,384
- And?
- You made a promise.

687
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,621
To return the Stark girls to
their mother who is now dead.

688
00:45:27,655 --> 00:45:29,222
To keep them safe.

689
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,224
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen

690
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:32,926
since her father was killed.

691
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,596
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

692
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,731
There's a certain safety in
death, wouldn't you say?

693
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:41,034
And Sansa Stark is
now Sansa Lannister.

694
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,869
Bit of a complication.

695
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:45,439
A complication does not
release you from a vow.

696
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:47,674
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

697
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:50,410
And take her where? Where
would she be safer than here?

698
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,245
Look me in the eye and tell me

699
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,581
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.

700
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:03,690
Are you sure we're not related?

701
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:05,993
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen

702
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:07,628
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.

703
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:09,162
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

704
00:46:09,197 --> 00:46:12,032
You've got the hair for
it if not the looks.

705
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:05,552
<font color="#808080">It's all right.

706
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:07,688
It's all right.
It's all right.

707
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,925
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

708
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:14,428
I have good reason to be.

709
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:18,265
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

710
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,202
Don't you know me?

711
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:27,708
Ser Dontos. The king's
nameday celebration.

712
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:30,010
I'm sorry. I should
have remembered.

713
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:32,079
I can't accept your apology.

714
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:35,582
I may be a fool, but I'm a
living fool, thanks to you.

715
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:37,984
Anyone would have
done the same.

716
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,953
But only you did.

717
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,489
I can never repay you.

718
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:45,859
You gave me my life. But this,

719
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:49,129
this is worth more
than my life.

720
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:54,501
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

721
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:56,403
House Hollard was strong once.

722
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:58,438
House on the rise.

723
00:47:58,473 --> 00:48:01,007
That's all that's
left of those days,

724
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:04,878
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.

725
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,847
I can't take it.

726
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:09,950
It's very, very kind
of you, but I can't.

727
00:48:09,984 --> 00:48:12,152
I don't have
anything else left.

728
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:14,688
That's all.

729
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:16,423
Take it. Wear it.

730
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:19,025
Let my name have one
more moment in the sun

731
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,294
before it disappears
from the world.

732
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,168
I'll wear it with
pride, Ser Dontos.

733
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:30,470
Yeah.

734
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,441
<i>When am I going to get
a horse of my own?</i>

735
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,767
The little lady wants a pony.

736
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:03,603
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

737
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:06,540
Horses aren't easy to come by.

738
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:07,579
Even if they were,

739
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:09,502
you think I'm gonna put
you on your own horse?

740
00:49:10,344 --> 00:49:13,814
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

741
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:16,683
Why don't you have any money?

742
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:19,252
Didn't you steal anything
from Joffrey before you left?

743
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:21,254
No.

744
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,323
You're not very smart, are you?

745
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:25,292
I'm not a thief.

746
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:27,327
You're fine with
murdering little boys,

747
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:29,229
but thieving is beneath you?

748
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:31,932
A man's got to have a code.

749
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,401
You think I'm gonna escape?

750
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:36,436
Where would I go?

751
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,405
I'd be dead by
nightfall without you.

752
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:40,907
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

753
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:44,211
You've got an aunt in the Vale.

754
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:47,447
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,

755
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:49,482
maybe she'll have
enough left over

756
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,651
to buy you that pony
you want so much.

757
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:58,058
<i>I'm hungry.
You're hungry.</i>

758
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:00,627
Five horses, five men.

759
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,197
More than I feel like killing
on an empty stomach.

760
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:12,806
I know him.

761
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,575
<i>The small one. His
name is Polliver.</i>

762
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,712
He captured us and
took us to Harrenhal.

763
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:22,916
He killed Lommy.

764
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:24,718
What the fuck's a Lommy?

765
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:27,287
He was my friend.

766
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:30,290
Polliver stole my sword and put
it right through his neck.

767
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:33,793
He's still got it.

768
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:35,562
Got what?

769
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,464
My sword Needle.

770
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,334
Needle? Of course you
named your sword.

771
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:42,669
Lots of people
name their swords.

772
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:44,838
Lots of cunts.

773
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,846
What are you... get back here.

774
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,481
My brother gave me that sword.

775
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,217
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

776
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,985
I don't care if he
ate your friend.

777
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,954
We're not going in there.

778
00:51:04,558 --> 00:51:07,260
<i>Come on, give it up.</i>

779
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:13,566
Come here.</font>

780
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:16,670
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.

781
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:47,801
<font color="#808080">Come here.

782
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:51,638
Please, she's a good girl.

783
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:53,273
Shut your mouth and
pour us more ale

784
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:55,742
and we may not take her with
us when we're done with her.

785
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:02,649
I know you.

786
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,053
You're the Hound.

787
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:11,091
<i>Pour our new friend some ale.</i>

788
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:17,831
What brings you so far north?

789
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:19,432
I could ask the same of you.

790
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,507
What are you doing up here?

791
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,135
Just keeping the king's peace.

792
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:23,903
No need. The war's over.

793
00:52:23,938 --> 00:52:27,307
So I've heard. Stannis
defeated at the Blackwater.

794
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,342
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.

795
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:30,610
And where am I for all of it?

796
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:32,712
Stuck with your brother.

797
00:52:32,747 --> 00:52:35,315
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.

798
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:37,017
He's good, the Mountain is.

799
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:38,518
Best at what he does.

800
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:41,821
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.

801
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:44,591
<i>You spend enough time putting
the hammer to people,</i>

802
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:47,660
<i>you start to feel like a
carpenter making chairs.</i>

803
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:49,763
Drains the fun right out of it.

804
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,064
And what's life
without a little fun?

805
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,736
But I don't need to
tell you that, eh?

806
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:01,341
She's all right.
I've had better.

807
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:06,946
You know what?

808
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,815
You should come with us.

809
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:12,719
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

810
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:15,688
Gold, silver, more daughters.

811
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:18,191
<i>Always something if you
know how to make them talk.</i>

812
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,727
And there's plenty of him between
here and King's Landing.

813
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:22,462
You could do well for yourself.

814
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:24,297
We certainly have been.

815
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:29,869
I'm not going to
King's Landing.

816
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:32,572
Think about it. We could
do whatever we like

817
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:35,408
wherever we go.

818
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:37,377
These are the king's colors.

819
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,379
No one's standing
in his way now.

820
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:42,582
Which means no one's
standing in ours.

821
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:45,852
Fuck the king.

822
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:58,164
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail

823
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,300
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,

824
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,402
I didn't believe it.

825
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:05,138
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

826
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:07,774
Bring me one of those chickens.

827
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:09,943
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

828
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:12,378
<font color="#808080">No.

829
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:14,180
But we're the king's men.

830
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:17,750
So, you got money?

831
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:19,586
Not a penny.

832
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,489
I'll still take that chicken.

833
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:24,224
Tell you what.

834
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,292
We'll trade you.

835
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:28,495
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

836
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:31,498
<i>Give us a go at your friend.</i>

837
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,901
Lowell there likes
them a bit broken in.

838
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,644
You're a talker.

839
00:54:45,913 --> 00:54:49,282
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.

840
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,900
Ah.

841
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:08,902
And hungry.

842
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:11,671
Think I'll take two chickens.

843
00:55:20,147 --> 00:55:22,849
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

844
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,518
I understand that
if any more words

845
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:28,188
come pouring out of
your cunt mouth,

846
00:55:28,222 --> 00:55:31,925
I'm gonna have to eat every
fucking chicken in this room.

847
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:34,694
You lived your
life for the king.

848
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,364
You're gonna die
for some chickens?

849
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,601
Someone is.

850
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:41,854
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

851
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,856
What? What do you mean?

852
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:46,859
Can you walk? I've
got to carry you?

853
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,695
Carry me?

854
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:52,799
Fine little blade.

855
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,606
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

856
00:58:49,523 --> 00:59:00,032
