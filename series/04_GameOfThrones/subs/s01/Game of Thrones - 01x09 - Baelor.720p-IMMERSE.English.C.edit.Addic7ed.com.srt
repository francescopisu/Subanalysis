1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:01,820
<i>Arya Stark,</i>
<i>come with us.</i>

2
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:03,124
<i>Your father wants</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,800
My father wouldn't
send you.

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,788
Go.

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,367
- <i>Been dead awhile, I'd say.</i>
- If they'd been dead

6
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:15,408
- for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.

7
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,447
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

8
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,017
<i>You are the daughter</i>
<i>of a traitor.</i>

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,924
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

10
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,400
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

11
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,973
If you would help your father,
urge your brother to come

12
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,448
to King's Landing and swear
his fealty to Joffrey.

13
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,052
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

14
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:32,628
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.

15
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:33,831
Call the banners.

16
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,376
<i>Snow?</i>

17
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:43,792
It is said that the men of the Mountain
clans are great warriors.

18
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:45,229
Ride with me
against my enemies

19
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:48,002
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

20
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:50,843
Only if the half man
fights with us.

21
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:56,962
His wound must be
washed and sewn

22
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:59,471
<i>or it will fester.</i>

23
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,645
I'm giving you half
of our forces--

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,081
<i>30,000 men.</i>

25
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,287
We need to break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

26
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,994
<i>The scouts report</i>
<i>Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

27
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,802
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

28
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:14,672
To do either we need
to cross the river.

29
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,010
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

30
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:20,652
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

31
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,458
I ask mercy
for my father. <i> Please.</i>

32
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:25,161
Your father has
to confess

33
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:27,367
and say
that <i>I'm</i> the King...

34
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,805
<i>Or there'll be</i>
<i>no mercy for him.</i>

<i>You've seen</i>

38
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,844
Another visit?

39
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,613
It seems
you're my last friend.

40
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:49,416
No no,
many still love you.

41
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,718
Sansa came to court
this morning

44
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,692
Did you laugh
with the others?

45
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,527
You do me wrong, My Lord.

46
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,762
Your blood is
the last thing I want.

47
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,597
I don't know
what you want.

48
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,565
I've given up
trying to guess.

49
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,037
When I was still a boy--

50
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:17,274
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--

51
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:21,611
I traveled with a group
of actors through the free cities.

52
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,182
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

53
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:29,118
The same is true
at court.

54
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:31,487
I am the master
of whisperers.

55
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,390
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

56
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,826
I'm a good actor,
My Lord.

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,362
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?

58
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,129
I could.

59
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:44,797
But will I?

60
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,465
No.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,333
As I said,
I'm no hero.

62
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,401
What do you want?
Tell me.

63
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:54,402
No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?

64
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:58,104
Peace.

65
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,939
Did you know that
your son is marching south

66
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:04,041
with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--

67
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:06,711
fighting for
his father's freedom.

68
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:08,979
Robb?

69
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,013
He's just a boy.

70
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,482
Boys have been
conquerors before.

71
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,817
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights

72
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:19,420
is the King's--
the late King's brother.

73
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,923
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,

74
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,159
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

75
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,327
Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.

76
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,629
The Throne
is his by rights.

77
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,199
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,

78
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,468
it would be a shame
to throw it away.

79
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:40,237
Cersei is no fool.

80
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:44,274
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

81
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:47,076
You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,

82
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,845
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,948
I want you
to serve the realm!

84
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,718
Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,

85
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,021
tell your son
to lay down his sword

86
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,325
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

87
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,230
Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.

88
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,332
If you give her
the peace she needs

89
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,235
and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,

90
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,071
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

91
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,539
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

92
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,642
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

93
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:25,480
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

94
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,282
Of what?

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,155
You grew up with actors.

96
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,459
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

97
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,094
But I grew up
with soldiers.

98
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,265
I learned how to die
a long time ago.

99
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:52,069
Pity.

100
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,371
<i>Such a pity.</i>

101
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,479
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

102
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:06,615
<i>Is that a precious</i>
<i>thing to you?</i>

103
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,381
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

104
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,517
Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.

105
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,852
Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder

106
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,487
sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.

107
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:00,523
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

108
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:04,492
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

109
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,628
Look.

110
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,697
<i>Father rots</i>
<i>in a dungeon.</i>

111
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:11,765
How long before
they take his head?

112
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,101
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

113
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,536
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

114
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,539
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

115
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:23,942
Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

116
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,710
The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

117
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:30,146
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

118
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,014
Have my horse
saddled and ready.

119
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:35,751
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

120
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:38,619
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

121
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,058
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

122
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,294
Whatever it took.

123
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,229
If I'm going
to lead this army,

124
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,766
I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,336
I agree.

126
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,905
- I'll go.
- <i>You can't!</i>

127
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,540
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

128
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,208
He would never
harm me.

129
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:02,877
<i>Unless there was</i>
<i>a profit in it.</i>

130
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,383
What do you want?

131
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:14,085
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

132
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Oh spare me.

133
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,923
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

134
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:22,225
What am I supposed
to do with you?

135
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,595
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--

136
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,064
Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,

137
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,566
not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?

138
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,511
Father, please--

139
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:35,149
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

140
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,038
Your mother would still
be a milkmaid

141
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,974
if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.

142
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:47,713
All right,
you come forward.

143
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,558
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

144
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:05,261
<i>perhaps my sons will do me the honor</i>
<i>of shutting their mouths.</i>

145
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,567
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

146
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,503
We're talking
right now.

147
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:20,307
Fine.

148
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,975
Out! All of you!

149
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,820
You too.

150
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,195
You see that?

151
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,830
15 she is.

152
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,299
A little flower.

153
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:52,836
And her honey's all mine.

154
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:57,374
I'm sure she will
give you many sons.

155
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:01,144
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

156
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,513
He is quite ill, My Lord.

157
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:06,449
Didn't come to
the last one either.

158
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,952
Or the one before that.

159
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:12,555
Your family has always
pissed on me.

160
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,390
- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

161
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,793
The fine Lord Tully

162
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,094
would never marry any
of his children to mine.

163
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,062
I'm sure there
were reasons why--

164
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,731
I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid

165
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,301
of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

166
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:34,472
Why are you here?

167
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:37,140
To ask you

168
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,475
to open your gates,
My Lord,

169
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,990
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

170
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,224
Why should I let him?

171
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:47,198
If you could climb
your own battlements,

172
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,052
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

173
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,488
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

174
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,990
Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.

175
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,559
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

176
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,495
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

177
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,964
You swore an oath
to my father.

178
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:07,266
Oh yes, I said some words...

179
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,135
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

180
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,971
Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy

181
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:18,541
and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.

182
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,410
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

183
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,479
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

184
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:27,048
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

185
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:29,350
Lannister, Baratheon,

186
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:32,052
give me one good reason

187
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:35,522
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

188
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,892
<i>And... engage.

189
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,425
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

190
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,531
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

191
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:49,535
You'll be ready
for this then.

192
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,805
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

193
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,907
than a bear...

194
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,911
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

195
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,780
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

196
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,291
This is Valyrian steel.

197
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:19,093
It was my father's sword,

198
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,995
his father before him.

199
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,631
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

200
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,733
It was meant
for my son Jorah.

201
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,502
He brought dishonor
to our House,

202
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:32,038
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

203
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,841
before he fled
from Westeros.

204
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,210
My Lord, you honor me,
but I can't--

205
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,811
Oh, you can
and you will.

206
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:44,181
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

207
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,485
A bloody dead man
tried to kill me...

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,322
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

209
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:56,091
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

210
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,193
Right.
Now don't think this means

211
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,529
I approve
of this nonsense

212
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,631
with you
and Alliser Thorne.

213
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,199
That's a man's sword,

214
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,902
it'll take
a man to wield it.

215
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,938
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

216
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,406
No you won't!

217
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,508
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

218
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,744
The hand that your wolf

219
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,345
tore off
that thing's wrist--

220
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,082
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

221
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,950
Boy King.

222
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,819
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

223
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:30,354
And it puts
a thousand leagues

224
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:33,156
between you and Thorne.

225
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,692
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

226
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:38,327
and bring me
my supper.

227
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,828
Yes, My Lord.

228
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,940
- Well done.
- Well done.

229
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,711
You earned that, Snow.

230
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,714
Well done.

231
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,450
Go on,
let's have a look.

232
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,886
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

233
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,123
Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

234
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:25,200
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

235
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:28,236
Get off of it.
Piss off.

236
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,705
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

237
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,278
Give it here!

238
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,180
What is it?

239
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:40,282
- I--
- Look at its eyes.

240
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,850
- Give it.
- I can't.

241
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,653
You can't what?

242
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:49,223
I-- I'm really not
supposed to say.

243
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:52,726
And yet you really
want to say.

244
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,495
You want to say
that...?

245
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,767
There was a raven.

246
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,169
I read the message
to Maester Aemon.

247
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,972
It's your brother Robb.

248
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:09,140
What?

249
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,975
What about him?

250
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,944
He's heading south.

251
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,846
To war.

252
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:21,184
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

253
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,354
I should be there.

254
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,691
I should be with him.

255
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,037
...If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

256
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,607
Well?

257
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,142
What did he say?

258
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,044
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

259
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,015
- His men are yours as well--
- Huh.

260
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,250
--Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

261
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:03,986
against any who would
pursue you.

262
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,421
And what does
he want in return?

263
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:09,057
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

264
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:12,794
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

265
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,230
And?

266
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,266
And Arya

267
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:21,468
will marry his son Waldron

268
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,571
- <i>when they both come of age.</i>
- She won't be happy about that.

269
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:26,339
Hmmm.

270
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,710
And?

271
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,447
And

272
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:37,517
when the fighting
is done...

273
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,421
You will marry
one of his daughters.

274
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:44,391
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

275
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:47,928
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

276
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:50,030
I see.

277
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,167
Did you get a look at his daughters?

278
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,968
<i>I did.</i>

279
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:58,236
And?

280
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,439
One was...

281
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,712
Do you consent?

282
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,681
Can I refuse?

283
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,882
Not if you want to cross.

284
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,354
Then I consent.

285
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,495
Sam said you wanted
to see me?

286
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:07,397
I did indeed.

287
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:11,096
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

288
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,834
Tell me,
did you ever wonder

289
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,736
why the men
of The Night's Watch

290
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,638
take no wives
and father no children?

291
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:24,773
No.

292
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,242
So they will not love.

293
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:30,811
<i>Love is the death</i>
<i>of duty.</i>

294
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:34,815
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

295
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,450
between honor
on the one hand

296
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:40,119
and those he loves
on the other,

297
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,188
what would he do?

298
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:46,591
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

299
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:51,396
Then Lord Stark
is one man in 10,000.

300
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,565
Most of us are not
so strong.

301
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,433
What is honor

302
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:59,069
compared
to a woman's love?

303
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,671
<i>And what is duty</i>

304
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:05,241
<i>against the feel of a newborn son</i>
<i>in your arms?</i>

305
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:08,944
Or a brother's smile?

306
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:13,681
Sam told you.

307
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,616
We're all human.

308
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,218
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

309
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,054
Honor comes easy then.

310
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,024
Yet sooner or later

311
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,926
in every man's life

312
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,829
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

313
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,131
a day when
he must choose.

314
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,934
And this is my day?

315
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,069
Is that what
you're saying?

316
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:43,239
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh yes.

317
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:46,341
- I know.
- You do not know!

318
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:50,145
No one knows.

319
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:54,048
I may be a bastard,

320
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,551
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

321
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:04,693
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

322
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,197
They waited till I was old.

323
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,336
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South--

324
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,271
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

325
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,940
I was helpless,

326
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,775
blind, frail.

327
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:25,479
But when I heard

328
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,114
they had killed
my brother's son,

329
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:30,216
and his poor son...

330
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,683
And the children!

331
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:34,920
Even the little children.

332
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,022
Who are you?

333
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,894
My father was Maekar,

334
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,262
the first of his name.

335
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:50,499
My brother Aegon
reigned after him

336
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,501
when I had refused
the Throne.

337
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,105
And he was followed
by his son Aerys,

338
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:59,807
whom they called
the Mad King.

339
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:03,143
You're Aemon Targaryen.

340
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:06,112
I'm a Maester
of the Citadel,

341
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:11,684
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

342
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,956
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

343
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,459
You must make
that choice yourself,

344
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:25,495
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

345
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,932
As I have.

346
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:57,554
Drogo.

347
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,831
<i>Sajo anni.</i>

348
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,350
Hyah hyah.

349
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:25,768
<i>Our scouts tell us</i>

350
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:28,471
<i>the Stark host has moved</i>
<i>south from the Twins</i>

351
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:31,206
with Lord Frey's levies
in tow.

352
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,341
They're a day's
march north.

353
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:36,044
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

354
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:39,147
<i>but he does have</i>
<i>a certain mindless</i>

355
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:42,483
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

356
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,220
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

357
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,756
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

358
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,758
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

359
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:56,194
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes--

360
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,763
heavy black steel,
double-sided.

361
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,731
Shagga likes axes.

362
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,366
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

363
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,601
<i>will be in the vanguard.</i>

364
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,069
- The vanguard?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

365
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,970
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

366
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:12,508
<i>They do seem</i>
<i>rather ferocious.</i>

367
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:17,881
Ferocious?
Last night

368
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:21,551
a Moon brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

369
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,456
<i>Three Stone Crows seized the Moon</i>
<i>brother and opened his throat.</i>

370
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,459
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

371
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,695
which was fortunate,
but even still

372
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,530
Ulf is demanding
blood money,

373
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,166
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

374
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,302
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

375
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,870
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

376
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,940
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

377
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,676
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

378
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,116
It appears I'm not
hungry after all.

379
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,018
Excuse me, My Lords.

380
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:09,698
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

381
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:12,467
- I took her.
- Took her?

382
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,536
- From whom?
- From, uh...

383
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,437
Ser-- what's his name?

384
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,173
I don't know.
Ginger cunt three tents down.

385
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,410
<i>And he didn't have anything</i>
<i>to say about it?</i>

386
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:26,946
He said something.

387
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,016
Well, the odds of me
living long enough

388
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:34,652
for him to retaliate
just dropped drastically.

389
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:37,087
We'll be at
the vanguard tomorrow.

390
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,957
Oh well.

391
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:47,262
I... think I'll go
and find myself one.

392
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,232
Who are you?

393
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,567
Who would you like me to be?

394
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:57,003
What did your mother
call you?

395
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:58,789
Shae.

396
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,550
What did your
mother call you?

397
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:03,143
My mother died
giving birth to me.

398
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:06,713
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

399
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:10,249
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

400
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:12,117
For--

401
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,253
What do you want
from me?

402
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,022
What do I want from you?

403
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,392
I want you to share my tent.

404
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:24,461
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

405
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,298
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

406
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:29,600
I want you to take
no other man to bed

407
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,601
for as long
as we're together.

408
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:35,805
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world--

409
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,108
which it may well be.

410
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,744
And what do I get?

411
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:43,014
One: safety.

412
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:45,784
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

413
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,186
Two: the pleasure
of my company,

414
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:52,188
which I have heard
is spectacular.

415
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:54,557
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

416
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,693
And three: More gold

417
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:01,195
<i>than you can spend if you</i>
<i>lived a thousand years.</i>

418
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,331
Do you accept my proposal?

419
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:25,881
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

420
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,601
Doth-- Dothrae...

421
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:51,067
Ki ha-- hammi...

422
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:54,803
Ish nokitta...

423
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,805
Qana'th...

424
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:00,175
<i>Khaleesi.</i>

425
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,609
Come.

426
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,013
He's very strong.

427
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:09,182
No one understands
how strong he is.

428
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,067
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

429
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:33,803
He can't.
I won't let him.

430
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:37,072
Even a Queen doesn't
have that power.

431
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:42,977
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai--

432
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:47,214
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

433
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,282
Doth--

434
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:51,217
Even if--

435
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:54,320
--Even if he dies,

436
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:57,157
why would <i>I</i> run?

437
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,392
<i>I am Khaleesi</i>

438
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:03,029
and my-- my son will be
Khal after Drogo.

439
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:06,132
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

440
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:09,168
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

441
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:11,003
<i>after Drogo dies.</i>

442
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:13,673
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

443
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:15,908
He won't want any rivals.

444
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:18,544
Your boy will be plucked
from your breast

445
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:20,746
<i>and given to the dogs.</i>

446
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:24,483
I won't leave him.

447
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:36,962
The wound
has festered.

448
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,853
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

449
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:42,488
I think you're right.

450
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:48,694
You've saved me
once more.

451
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:51,363
And now you <i>must</i>
save him.

452
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:53,766
He's beyond
the healer's skills.

453
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,501
All I can do is
ease his path.

454
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:58,669
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

455
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:01,973
You must know a way...

456
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,841
Some...

457
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,742
Some magic.

458
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,246
There is a spell.

459
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,514
Some would say death
is cleaner.

460
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,060
Do it.

461
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,161
Save him.

462
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,995
There is a price.

463
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,534
You'll have gold--
whatever you want.

464
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:33,032
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

465
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,334
Only death pays for life.

466
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:40,237
My death?

467
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:43,273
No.
Not your death, Khaleesi.

468
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,443
Bring me his horse.

469
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:11,503
Khaleesi,
do not do this thing.

470
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:15,306
- <i>Let me kill this witch.</i>
- Kill her and you kill your Khal.

471
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,142
This is Bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

472
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,945
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

473
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:33,657
Go now!

474
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:35,893
- Take her and leave.
- Huh-uh.

475
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,095
Take her!

476
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,532
Irriya?

477
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,368
You must go also, lady.

478
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,703
<i>Once I begin to sing,</i>
<i>no one must enter the tent.</i>

479
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,506
The dead will
dance here tonight.

480
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:04,588
No one will enter.

481
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:15,132
Bring him back to me.

482
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:33,517
What have you done?

483
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,852
I have to save him.

484
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:39,022
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

485
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,258
You would have been safe.

486
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:49,666
<i>Jíni'th vos eo.</i>

487
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,472
Mra qothoon vosaan--

488
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,876
Khaleesi!

489
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,485
Are you hurt?

490
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,986
- The baby...
- Hmm?

491
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,655
...Is coming.

492
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,224
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

493
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,260
They say
she is cursed.

494
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:55,830
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

495
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,600
The witch--
she can bring baby.

496
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,171
I hear her say so.

497
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,119
Are you in agony,
my lion?

498
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:28,721
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

499
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:32,124
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

500
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,395
Ahhh.

501
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,832
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

502
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,067
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

503
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,838
Let's play a new game.

504
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:51,973
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you--

505
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,809
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

506
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,811
- Not if you win.
- No!

507
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:00,346
No more fire games,
no knife games.

508
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,282
Let's do something
I'm good at.

509
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,517
What are you good at?

510
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:07,518
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

511
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:09,953
- This sounds like a boring game.
- <i>It's not.</i>

512
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,756
<i>Here's how it works:</i>
<i>I make a statement</i>

513
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,225
about your past.
If I'm right,

514
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:17,493
you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

515
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,228
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

516
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:22,330
I don't want to play
this game.

517
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,565
Fine.
Bronn first.

518
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,904
Your father beat you.

519
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,509
But my mother
hit harder.

520
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:44,448
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

521
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:46,383
It was a woman.

522
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,020
She swung
an axe at me.

523
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,356
You've been
North of the Wall.

524
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,494
What brought you
up there?

525
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,797
Work.

526
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,866
And...

527
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,935
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

528
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:09,238
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

529
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,475
Oh wait, that's me.

530
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,547
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

531
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:21,416
I don't want to play.

532
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,320
It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.

533
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:29,991
Your mother
was a whore.

534
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:33,828
Drink.

535
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,268
All right.

536
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:44,038
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

537
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,073
- never to return.
- Drink.

538
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:49,032
And we've established
the rules about lying?

539
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,257
Drink!

540
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:56,183
Mmmm.

541
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,419
You wanted
a different life.

542
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:02,588
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

543
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,191
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

544
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:07,493
So specifics--

545
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:10,730
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

546
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:14,434
I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.

547
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:18,738
So what's
a lowborn girl to do?

548
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,343
Drink.

549
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,048
- Are you sure--
- Drink!

550
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:37,257
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

551
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,729
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

552
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:47,301
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

553
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,502
My turn.

554
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:51,938
Fine fine.

555
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,273
Ask away.

556
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:57,376
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

557
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,178
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

558
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,546
I don't care the way
the game works.

559
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:04,682
Our Lord here
used to be married.

560
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:07,785
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

561
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:11,356
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

562
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:15,094
Another night,
perhaps.

563
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:18,431
Not another night.
This night.

564
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:21,602
It's not
a pleasant story.

565
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,777
- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I

566
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,547
can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.

567
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:34,214
So...

568
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:41,021
I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding

569
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:44,757
when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,

570
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,458
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

571
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:52,028
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

572
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:54,117
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

573
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:55,989
so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers

574
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:59,168
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

575
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:01,970
Her name was Tysha.

576
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,239
She was
a wheelwright's orphan.

577
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:06,407
And she was hungry--

578
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:09,844
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

579
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:13,279
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

580
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:16,148
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

581
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:19,586
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

582
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,054
or look away embarrassed

583
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,489
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

584
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,626
I forgot about
everything but Tysha.

585
00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:31,262
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

586
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:33,731
For three chickens,
I should hope so.

587
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:37,635
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

588
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,271
But she was good to me.

589
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,407
She kissed me afterwards

590
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:45,343
and sang me a song.

591
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:50,482
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

592
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:53,218
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

593
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:55,654
and there you have it--
man and wife.

594
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:59,291
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

595
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:01,359
and told my father.

596
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,362
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

597
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,430
Not quite.

598
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:10,068
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

599
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,205
The girl was a whore,
you see.

600
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,709
Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,

601
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,578
the road, the rapers--
all of it.

602
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:23,214
He thought it was time
I had a woman.

603
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,352
<i>After my brother confessed,</i>

604
00:42:27,386 --> 00:42:30,688
my father brought in my wife

605
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:33,491
and gave her
to his guards.

606
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:37,061
<i>He paid her well--</i>
<i>a silver for each man.</i>

607
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:40,064
How many whores command
that kind of price?

608
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,036
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

609
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,472
By the end,
she had so much silver

610
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:51,441
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

611
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:54,277
and rolling
onto the floor.

612
00:42:57,015 --> 00:43:00,017
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

613
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:03,287
You should have known
she was a whore.

614
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,622
Really?

615
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:08,492
I was 16, drunk
and in love--

616
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,427
A girl who
was almost raped

617
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,430
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

618
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:19,335
As I said, I was
young and stupid.

619
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:23,973
You are still
young and stupid.

620
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,497
Hyah!

621
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:07,348
What is it?
What do you want?

622
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:09,217
You're sleeping
through the war.

623
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:12,153
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

624
00:44:12,187 --> 00:44:14,421
They're a mile north.

625
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:17,057
- <i>Get my squire!</i>
- You don't have a squire.

626
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:21,761
If I die, weep for me.

627
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,098
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

628
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,109
I'll know.

629
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:37,812
Watch out!
Move!

630
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:40,415
Out of the way!

631
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,818
- Move aside!
- ( Neighs

632
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,827
Stay low.

633
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,963
Stay low?

634
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:55,565
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

635
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,135
I was born lucky.

636
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:03,040
Tribesmen of the Vale,

637
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:05,910
gather round!

638
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,446
Stone Crows!

639
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:10,748
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

640
00:45:10,782 --> 00:45:13,518
- Moon brothers!
- <i>And painted dogs!</i>

641
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:15,920
And painted dogs!

642
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:19,423
Your dominion over
the Vale begins now!

643
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:22,326
Onward to claim
what is yours!

644
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,795
Half man! Half man!

645
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,764
Half man!
Half man!

646
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:31,000
Half man! Half man!

647
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:32,968
To battle.

648
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,541
<i>You're a shit warrior.</i>

649
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:21,544
I'm alive?

650
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,913
You're alive.

651
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,319
Did we win?

652
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,955
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

653
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:49,636
How did our
tribesmen do?

654
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:52,973
Yeah, good.

655
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:56,143
<i>It's nice to see them</i>
<i>getting along.</i>

656
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:58,245
<i>You're wounded.</i>

657
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,480
Good of you to notice.

658
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:03,615
I hear we won.

659
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:06,284
Hmph.
The scouts were wrong.

660
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,354
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

661
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:13,524
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

662
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:15,592
He wasn't here.

663
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,461
Where was he?

664
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:20,163
With his other 18,000 men.

665
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:25,534
And where are they?

666
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:37,979
- We should go, My Lady.
- No!

667
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,451
My Lady!

668
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:49,187
Hyah hyah!

669
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,216
By the time they knew what was
happening, it had already happened.

670
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:29,654
Lady Stark.
I'd offer you my sword,

671
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,689
but I seem
to have lost it.

672
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:34,257
It's not your sword I want.

673
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:36,926
Give me my daughters back.

674
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:39,061
Give me my husband.

675
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,296
I've lost them too,
I'm afraid.

676
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,898
<i>Kill him, Robb.</i>
<i>Send his head to his father.</i>

677
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:46,100
He cut down 10 of our men--
you saw him.

678
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:49,036
He's more use
to us alive than dead.

679
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,138
Take him away
and put him in irons.

680
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:54,941
We could end this war
right now, boy,

681
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,009
save thousands of lives.

682
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:59,912
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

683
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:03,214
Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
choose your weapons

684
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,816
and let's end this
here and now.

685
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:10,686
If we do it your way,
Kingslayer,

686
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,421
you'd win.

687
00:49:15,624 --> 00:49:17,792
We're not doing it
your way.

688
00:49:19,728 --> 00:49:21,828
Come on, pretty man.

689
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:33,006
I sent 2,000 men
to their graves today.

690
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,575
The bards will sing songs
of their sacrifice.

691
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,845
Aye. But the dead
won't hear them.

692
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:48,387
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

693
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,958
Did we free my father?

694
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:55,894
Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

695
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,067
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

696
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:08,839
This war is far from over.

697
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,936
Could I have one?

698
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,572
A lemon one--
or any of them.

699
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:45,140
Three coppers.

700
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,742
How about
a nice fat pigeon?

701
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,677
Piss off now.
Go on.

702
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:52,580
Do you have any stale ones
from yesterday?

703
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:54,749
- Or any burnt ones?
- Piss off!

704
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,560
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

705
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,044
They're taking him
to the Sept of Baelor.

706
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:06,938
Who?

707
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,873
The Hand of the King.

708
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,666
- Traitor!
- Coward!

709
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,568
Baelor.

710
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,235
Baelor!

711
00:52:27,908 --> 00:52:30,543
Traitor!
Traitor!

712
00:52:50,494 --> 00:52:52,595
I am Eddard Stark,

713
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,029
Lord of Winterfell

714
00:52:55,064 --> 00:52:57,231
and Hand of the King.

715
00:53:06,073 --> 00:53:08,574
I come before you
to confess my treason

716
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:12,010
<i>in the sight of Gods</i>
<i>and men.</i>

717
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:15,447
<i>I betrayed the faith</i>
<i>of my King</i>

718
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:18,850
and the trust
of my friend Robert.

719
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:23,254
I swore to protect
and defend his children,

720
00:53:23,288 --> 00:53:25,656
but before his blood
was cold

721
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,191
<i>I plotted</i>
<i>to murder his son...</i>

722
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,961
And seize the Throne
for myself.

723
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:34,630
Traitor!

724
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,938
Let the high Septon

725
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,575
and Baelor the blessed
bear witness to what I say:

726
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,614
Joffrey Baratheon

727
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,483
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne,

728
00:53:56,517 --> 00:54:00,153
<i>by the Grace</i>
<i>of all the gods,</i>

729
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,722
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

730
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:05,024
and Protector
of the Realm.

731
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:14,668
As we sin,

732
00:54:14,736 --> 00:54:16,637
so do we suffer.

733
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:19,540
This man has
confessed his crimes

734
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:22,243
in sight
of Gods and men.

735
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:25,779
The Gods are just

736
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:28,649
but beloved Baelor
taught us

737
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:32,485
they can also be
merciful.

738
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:36,890
What is to be done

739
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:39,392
with this traitor,
Your Grace?

740
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:47,401
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

741
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:50,104
Stripped of all titles
and powers,

742
00:54:50,138 --> 00:54:52,774
he would serve the realm
in permanent exile.

743
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:54,509
And My Lady Sansa

744
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:58,012
<i>has begged mercy</i>
<i>for her father.</i>

745
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,685
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

746
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,254
So long as I am your King,

747
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:11,192
<i>treason shall never</i>
<i>go unpunished.</i>

748
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:13,293
Ser Ilyn,

749
00:55:13,328 --> 00:55:14,928
bring me his head!

750
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:17,130
No! Stop!

751
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:19,266
Daddy!
Someone stop him!

752
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,446
My son, this is madness.

753
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:36,216
<i>Put him down!</i>

754
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,624
- Don't look!
- Let me go.

755
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:46,627
- Let me go!
- Shut your mouth. Look at me.

756
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:49,430
- Look at me!
- Stop! Daddy!

757
00:55:49,464 --> 00:55:51,532
- Stop! No no!
- Traitor!

758
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,100
<i>Stop!</i>

759
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:58,504
Stop him, stop!

760
