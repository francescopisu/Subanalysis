1
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,581
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,286
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,056
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,127
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,863
<i>Hit me hard.</i>

6
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,807
Sulk all you want.

7
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,710
The truth is, you're lucky.

8
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:07,514
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

9
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:10,149
Someone worse than me
would find you.

10
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,731
There's no one worse than you.

11
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,055
Ha, you never knew my brother.

12
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,624
He once killed a man
for snoring.

13
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,194
There's plenty worse than me.

14
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,729
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

15
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:23,798
men who like to rape them.

16
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,934
I saved your sister
from some of them.

17
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,237
You're lying.

18
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,339
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

19
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,074
Ask her who came back for her

20
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,944
when the mob
had her on her back.

21
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:39,381
They would have
taken her every which way

22
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,916
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

23
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,625
Is that the Blackwater?

24
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:52,094
The Blackwater?

25
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,462
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

26
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,201
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

27
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,970
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

28
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,906
That's the Red Fork.

29
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,408
I'm taking you to the Twins.

30
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,645
But why?

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,348
Because your mother
and brother will be there

32
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,483
and they'll pay me for you.

33
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,988
Why would they be at the Twins?

34
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:22,893
Those outlaws you
love so much never told you?

35
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,562
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

36
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:30,100
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

37
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,135
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

38
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,805
and we might just make it there
in time for the wedding.

39
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:55,657
Men who fight for gold have
neither honor nor loyalty.

40
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,259
<i>They cannot be trusted.</i>

41
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,928
<i>They can be trusted to
kill you if they're well paid.</i>

42
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:02,231
<i>The Yunkish
are paying them well.</i>

43
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,999
You know these men?

44
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,701
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

45
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:09,537
They're called the Second Sons.

46
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,473
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

47
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:15,142
"The Titan's Bastard."

48
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,544
Is he more titan or bastard?

49
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,847
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

50
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,916
They all are.

51
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,253
How many?

52
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,856
<i>2,000, Your Grace.</i>

53
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,558
<i>Armored and mounted.</i>

54
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,794
Enough to make a difference?

55
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,433
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

56
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm sure the sellswords prefer
to fight for the winning side.

57
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,305
I imagine you're right.

58
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,576
I'd like to talk to the Titan's
Bastard about winning.

59
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,679
He may not agree to meet.

60
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:51,147
He will.

61
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:54,884
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

62
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:57,487
<i>Your Grace,
allow me to present</i>

63
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:00,489
<i>the captains
of the Second Sons...</i>

64
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:03,525
Mero of Braavos,

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,628
Prendahl na Ghezn,

66
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,097
and...

67
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,632
Daario Naharis.

68
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,871
You are the Mother of Dragons?

69
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:20,809
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

70
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:23,578
- Mind your tongue.
<i>- Why?</i>

71
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,015
I didn't mind hers.

72
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,951
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

73
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,591
You, slave girl, bring wine.

74
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,927
We have no slaves here.

75
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,962
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

76
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,098
unless I save you.

77
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,536
Take your clothes off and
come and sit on Mero's lap

78
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,338
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

79
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:50,241
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

80
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:53,444
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

81
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,913
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

82
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,615
We have more, don't we?

83
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,184
<i>10,000 Unsullied.</i>

84
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,219
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

85
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,288
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

86
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,759
can explain to me how you
propose to defeat us.

87
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,628
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

88
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,632
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

89
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,003
You're very young
to be a captain.

90
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,639
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

91
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,708
Even if your numbers are right,

92
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,043
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

93
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,112
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

94
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,881
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

95
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,052
Or you could fight for me.

96
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,056
We've taken the slavers' gold.

97
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,825
We fight for Yunkai.

98
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,128
<i>I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i> -

99
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,298
Our contract is our bond.

100
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,832
If we break our bond,

101
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,035
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

102
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,305
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

103
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,741
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

104
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,343
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

105
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,879
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

106
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,581
You have no cavalry.

107
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,150
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

108
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,519
A year ago, I had no dragons.

109
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,123
You have two days to decide.

110
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,096
Show me your cunt. I want to see
if it's worth fighting for.

111
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,465
_

112
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,069
_

113
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,670
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

114
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:29,206
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

115
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,041
Only a flagon?

116
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,109
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

117
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,778
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

118
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:39,248
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

119
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,954
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

120
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,389
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

121
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,997
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

122
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,302
Ser Barristan,

123
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:03,273
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

124
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:05,442
Gladly, Your Grace.

125
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,964
Half Robert, half lowborn.

126
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,501
Show the boy to his chambers.

127
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,805
<i>Have the maids draw him a bath and
find him some decent clothes.</i>

128
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,008
I'll come visit you soon.

129
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,518
What do you mean
to do with him?

130
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,187
You know what I mean
to do with him.

131
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,355
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

132
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,058
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

133
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,394
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

134
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,262
No.

135
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,365
If the lamb sees the knife,

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,467
she panics.

137
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,636
Her panic seeps into her meat,

138
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,905
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

139
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,307
You've slaughtered many lambs?

140
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,410
And none have seen the blade.

141
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,590
"And tho... and thowg..."

142
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,394
V-v-visenya...

143
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,396
Targaryen...

144
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,533
rod... rode

145
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,369
Vhagar...

146
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,604
"Vhag... "

147
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,107
Fuck me.

148
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,812
<i>"Visenya Targaryen"</i>

149
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,181
rode Vhagar,

150
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:29,919
the smallest of the dragons,

151
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:32,087
though still...

152
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,457
large enog...

153
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,959
Enough... enough

154
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:41,997
"to swallow
a horse whole."

155
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,112
Your Grace.

156
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:59,014
They feeding you enough?

157
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,783
<i>Two meals a day.</i>

158
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,118
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper.

159
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,953
I cannot complain.

160
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:08,190
You don't belong
in a place like this.

161
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:11,326
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

162
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,962
Yeah.

163
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,101
I'm sorry about your son.

164
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,438
<i>Didn't get the chance
to tell you before.</i>

165
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:25,675
Good lad.
Loyal lad.

166
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,948
Melisandre's returned.

167
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,251
I didn't know she'd been gone.

168
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,420
Came back with a bastard boy.

169
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:39,924
Robert's bastard boy.

170
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,792
Why?

171
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,628
She says there's power
in king's blood.

172
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,731
She's going to kill him.

173
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,099
Sacrifice him.

174
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,668
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

175
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,937
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

176
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,706
The boy is your nephew.

177
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,208
What of it?
We're at war.

178
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:01,145
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

179
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,148
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

180
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,184
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

181
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,123
So did Renly.

182
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,392
Renly wronged you.

183
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,162
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

184
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,664
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

185
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,867
This boy has done you no harm.

186
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,570
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live in Westeros?

187
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:27,174
How many girls? How many men?
How many women?

188
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,442
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

189
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,378
The night that never ends.

190
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,347
Unless I triumph.

191
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:34,882
I never asked for this.

192
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,617
No more than I asked
to be king.

193
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:40,021
We do not choose our destiny,

194
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:42,590
but we must do our duty, no?

195
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:45,359
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

196
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:50,698
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

197
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,037
Your Grace,

198
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:58,172
why did you come
to see me today?

199
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,941
I came to free you.

200
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:04,645
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

201
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,847
I swear it.

202
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,150
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

203
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,219
You have little regard
for your own life.

204
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:14,321
Quite little, Your Grace.

205
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,723
Verging on none.

206
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:20,560
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow,

207
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,230
but you came to me now before
this boy is put to the knife

208
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:27,067
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

209
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,404
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

210
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,873
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

211
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:36,309
for gain or glory.

212
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:43,350
When my son was five
he said to me,

213
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,852
"I don't ever
want to die."

214
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,188
I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.
You won't ever."

215
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:54,159
<i>I hated the idea of him lying
awake in the dark, afraid.</i>

216
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,865
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

217
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,068
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

218
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,105
I saw a vision in the flames.

219
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,210
A great battle in the snow.

220
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,046
I saw it.

221
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,252
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

222
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,090
<i>I never believed,
but when you see the truth,</i>

223
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,659
when it's right there
in front of you

224
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,261
as real as these iron bars,

225
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,331
how can you deny
her god is real?

226
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,822
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

227
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,557
You talk too much.

228
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:00,160
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

229
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,862
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

230
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:05,665
My cock will find a way.

231
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,735
Tell him. Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

232
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,371
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

233
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,707
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

234
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,777
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

235
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,780
And I'm no whore, my friend.

236
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:23,116
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

237
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,618
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

238
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,153
For beauty?

239
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,754
We fight for gold.

240
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,126
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die...

241
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,062
The thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

242
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,432
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

243
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,967
You'll die young.

244
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,568
<i>What do we do
about the dragon girl?</i>

245
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,438
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

246
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,174
There won't be a battle. And we don't
have to deal with her eunuchs.

247
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,709
We only have to deal with her.

248
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,311
- She's well guarded.
<i>- Tonight's a new moon.</i>

249
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,948
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

250
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,619
Which one of us?

251
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,588
Close your eyes, love.

252
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,163
Three coins.

253
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,065
A coin from Meereen,

254
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,334
a coin from Volantis,

255
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,936
and a coin from Braavos.

256
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,637
The Braavosi does the deed.

257
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,210
One for each of us, darling.

258
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,113
No peeking.

259
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,664
Do you hear me?

260
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,200
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

261
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,570
You have something for me?

262
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,977
Valar morghulis.

263
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,734
Lady Sansa.

264
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,138
You look very handsome,
my lord.

265
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,739
Oh, yes.

266
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,175
The husband of your dreams.

267
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,844
But you do look glorious.

268
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,851
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

269
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,520
Do you mind?

270
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,725
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

271
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,245
My lady,

272
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,814
I want you to know

273
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,183
I didn't ask for this.

274
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:11,919
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

275
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,654
No, don't.

276
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:16,624
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

277
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,659
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

278
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,762
You'll be my wife.

279
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:25,167
I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.

280
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,838
I just wanted to say...

281
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:32,509
I'm just trying
to say very badly...

282
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:36,413
I just...

283
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,248
Just want to say
I know how you feel.

284
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:44,486
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

285
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:47,956
You're right.

286
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,325
I have no idea how you feel.

287
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,627
And you have no idea
how I feel.

288
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:02,703
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

289
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:06,407
I won't ever hurt you.

290
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,813
Do you drink wine?

291
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,383
When I have to.

292
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,653
Well, today you have to.

293
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,929
<i>You look
radiant, Your Grace.</i>

294
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:30,565
Radiant?
Why radiant?

295
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,434
It's the word
that came to mind.

296
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:36,505
We're going to be sisters soon.

297
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,941
We should be friends.

298
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,510
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

299
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:44,380
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

300
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:47,350
A better dancer than a
singer, I'm afraid.

301
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,952
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

302
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:53,490
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

303
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:56,493
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

304
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,995
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

305
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,163
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

306
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,598
Very wealthy.

307
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:05,167
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

308
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:09,571
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

309
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:12,040
Of course, ambitious
climbers don't want to stop

310
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,375
on the second highest rung.

311
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,244
If only you could take
that final step,

312
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,147
you'd see further
than all the rest.

313
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:23,150
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

314
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:26,120
So Lord Reyne built a castle

315
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,122
as grand as Casterly Rock.

316
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,724
He gave his wife diamonds

317
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,293
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

318
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,662
And finally one day,

319
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:37,031
he rebelled against my father.

320
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,734
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

321
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,302
Gone.

322
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:43,604
Gone.

323
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,874
A gentle word.

324
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,409
Why not say slaughtered?

325
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:51,312
Every man, woman, and child

326
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,815
put to the sword.

327
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,884
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

328
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,553
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

329
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:01,490
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

330
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:03,925
It was a long summer.

331
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:07,595
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

332
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,697
and not a soul to hear."

333
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:16,904
If you ever
call me sister again,

334
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,573
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

335
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,006
What are you doing?

336
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,775
Your father's gone.

337
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,911
As the father of the realm,

338
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:01,348
it is my duty to give you
away to your husband.

339
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,869
You may now cloak the bride

340
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:28,972
and bring her
under your protection.

341
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,005
Could you...

342
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,914
Thank you.

343
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,890
Your Grace, Your Grace,

344
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:18,492
<i>my lords, my ladies,</i>

345
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:21,696
<i>we stand here in the sight
of gods and men</i>

346
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,132
<i>to witness the union
of man and wife.</i>

347
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:29,036
<i>One flesh, one heart, one soul,</i>

348
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,973
now and forever.

349
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,290
Have you ever seen one like it?

350
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:54,259
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

351
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:55,960
Not in my life.

352
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:57,729
It's shocking, isn't it,

353
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,831
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

354
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:03,801
When I was your age, I lived
on one bowl of stew a day.

355
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:06,738
And stew is a kind word for it.

356
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,609
In Flea Bottom we called
them bowls of brown.

357
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:14,713
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

358
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:17,850
We knew it wasn't chicken.

359
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:32,599
Here, taste this.

360
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,169
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

361
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:58,857
That's good.

362
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,062
That's really good.

363
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:06,397
<i>Where do you think it's from?</i>

364
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,166
I couldn't even guess.

365
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,934
Doesn't matter, does it?

366
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:12,137
It's the real thing
or it's not.

367
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:15,340
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

368
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,711
Go on, have some more.

369
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,651
You still don't trust it.

370
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,253
You think this is all a mistake

371
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:30,989
and that you'll have to pay
somehow for every bite you take.

372
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,358
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

373
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:37,495
There are no mistakes.

374
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,464
Not for us.

375
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:43,067
I'm a mistake.

376
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:45,303
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

377
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,271
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

378
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:51,008
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

379
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,811
He willed it so you
could be here right now

380
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,079
with a power inside you

381
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:59,115
you can't even begin
to understand.

382
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:04,221
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

383
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:06,223
and birth it into the world.

384
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:11,461
We're both a part of His plan.

385
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:14,130
He wants this for us.

386
00:28:14,165 --> 00:28:17,000
No, He demands this of us.

387
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:23,340
I don't understand.
This...

388
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,175
This doesn't seem
very religious.

389
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:27,677
According to whom?

390
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,147
The Silent Sisters?

391
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,115
With their stern looks,

392
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,452
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

393
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:40,422
What have their gods
done for you?

394
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,457
Hmm?

395
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:44,226
When you pray to them,

396
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,494
what's their answer?

397
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,097
A god is real or he's not.

398
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:52,967
You only need eyes to see.

399
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:00,641
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

400
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:03,644
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

401
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:08,516
And we can stop it, you and I.

402
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:38,813
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

403
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:40,882
Come fight death with me.

404
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:12,315
What are you doing?

405
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:17,420
You have to trust me.

406
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,145
What...?

407
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,581
Get it away.

408
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:45,982
Get it off me.

409
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:48,785
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

410
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:51,822
Why are you doing this?

411
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,826
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

412
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:57,829
And you have so much blood.

413
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:00,898
No. No, no, no, no!

414
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,103
Not there.
Not there!

415
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:12,743
You can blame Ser Davos.

416
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:15,412
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

417
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:19,683
He wanted a demonstration.

418
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:22,887
<i>Please.
Please, Your Grace.</i>

419
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,390
<i>My lord!</i>

420
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:03,493
The usurper Robb Stark.

421
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:09,199
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

422
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:15,906
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

423
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,726
So their son
will be your nephew.

424
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,362
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

425
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:44,701
And you will be
the king's stepfather

426
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,037
and brother-in-law.

427
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:48,938
When you marry the king,

428
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:52,842
<i>Joffrey's mother will
become his sister-in-law</i>

429
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:56,946
<i>and your son
will be Loras' nephew?</i>

430
00:32:56,981 --> 00:33:00,716
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

431
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:03,286
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

432
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,555
That much is beyond dispute.

433
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,577
Will you pardon me, my lord?

434
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,314
Of course. Of course.
En... enjoy.

435
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:39,954
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

436
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,092
I've got a lifetime for that.

437
00:33:56,438 --> 00:33:58,306
Stay.

438
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:09,150
You seem rather drunk.

439
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:11,987
Rather less than I plan to be.

440
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,890
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

441
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,491
This isn't
about your wedding.

442
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:18,827
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

443
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:21,130
Your wife needs a child,

444
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:24,166
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

445
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:27,003
- And?
- If you're going to give her one,

446
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:29,038
you need to perform.

447
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:31,941
What did you once call me?

448
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,444
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

449
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:37,047
- More than once.
- <i>There you have it.</i>

450
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,149
Nothing to worry about.

451
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:41,484
Drinking and lust,

452
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,153
no man can match me
in these things.

453
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:47,456
I am the god of tits and wine.

454
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,926
I shall build
a shrine to myself

455
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,861
at the next brothel I visit.

456
00:34:53,203 --> 00:34:56,298
You can drink, you can joke,

457
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:58,733
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

458
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,535
to make your father
uncomfortable,

459
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:03,371
but you will do your duty.

460
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,913
Well...

461
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:49,887
My father once told me...

462
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,157
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

463
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,750
Congratulations, my lady.

464
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,218
Thank you, Your Grace.

465
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:21,854
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

466
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,789
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

467
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:27,026
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

468
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,928
What a glorious day.

469
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,429
Yes, Your Grace.

470
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,865
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

471
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,401
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

472
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:38,504
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

473
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:40,973
after my uncle passes out.

474
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,875
How'd you like that?

475
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,946
You wouldn't?

476
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,982
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

477
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,289
Time for the bedding ceremony.

478
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:59,326
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

479
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,161
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

480
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:03,696
Come, everyone.

481
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:05,999
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

482
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:09,769
Get rid of her gown. She won't
be needing it any longer.

483
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:12,706
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

484
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,574
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

485
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,811
There will be if I command it.

486
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:22,550
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

487
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:25,687
with a wooden cock.

488
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:29,657
What did you say?

489
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:37,899
What did you say?!

490
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:41,569
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

491
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,073
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the king.</i>

492
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:56,115
A bad joke, Your Grace.

493
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,719
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

494
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,623
Mine is so small.

495
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,493
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

496
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:09,863
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

497
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:12,299
<i>I am.</i>

498
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,534
Guilty.

499
00:38:15,636 --> 00:38:17,437
But...

500
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,374
But it is my wedding night.

501
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:25,579
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

502
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,016
Come, wife.

503
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:35,855
I vomited on a girl once

504
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:37,357
in the middle of the act.

505
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,025
Not proud of it.

506
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,962
But I think honesty
is important

507
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:44,532
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

508
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:47,035
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

509
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:49,104
Put you in the mood.

510
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:23,305
Is that wise, my lord?

511
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,107
Tyrion, Sansa.

512
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:28,209
My name is Tyrion.

513
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,212
Is that wise, Tyrion?

514
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:38,452
Nothing was ever wiser.

515
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:52,865
Astoundingly long.

516
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:54,933
What?

517
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:56,735
Neck.

518
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,570
You have one.

519
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:03,242
How old are you exactly?

520
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,511
14.

521
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:13,519
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

522
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:24,264
My lord father has commanded me

523
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,867
to consummate this marriage.

524
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,251
Stop.

525
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:50,688
I can't.

526
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:56,294
I could, I won't.

527
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:57,729
But your father...

528
00:41:57,763 --> 00:42:00,331
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

529
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:02,566
I know where he can start.

530
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,639
I won't share your bed.

531
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:15,311
Not until you want me to.

532
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,650
What if I never want you to?

533
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,830
And so my watch begins.

534
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:29,418
19?

535
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:30,720
Yes, Your Grace.

536
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:33,689
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

537
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,059
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

538
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:39,295
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

539
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:42,365
or grunt at my husband
and hope...

540
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:45,936
What do you mean
reasonably well?

541
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:50,341
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

542
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,476
So guttural and harsh.

543
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:56,116
_

544
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:57,954
_

545
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:03,987
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

546
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:06,557
Athjahaka.

547
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,992
Ath-ja-hakar.

548
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:11,694
Athjahakar.

549
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:16,499
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

550
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:19,802
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

551
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:23,272
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

552
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:26,209
<i>It is the only proper
language for poetry.</i>

553
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:34,584
No screaming or she dies.

554
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,299
What do you want?

555
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,369
You.

556
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,937
Let her go.

557
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:56,206
Don't scream, lovely girl.

558
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,314
You were sent here to kill me?

559
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,184
So why haven't you?

560
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:10,719
I don't want to.

561
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:13,721
What do your captains
have to say about that?

562
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:15,990
You should ask them.

563
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:22,630
Why?

564
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:25,399
We had philosophical
differences.

565
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,802
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

566
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:30,772
<i>It meant more to me
than it did to them.</i>

567
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:32,774
You're a strange man.

568
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,809
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

569
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:36,344
I only do what I want to do.

570
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:38,280
And this is supposed
to impress me?

571
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,615
Yes.

572
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:45,187
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

573
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:47,623
They ordered me to murder you.

574
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:49,825
<i>I told them I preferred not to.</i>

575
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,227
<i>They told me I had no choice.</i>

576
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:54,330
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

577
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,199
I always have a choice.

578
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:01,104
They drew their swords

579
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:03,239
and I drew mine.

580
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,838
Will you fight for me?

581
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,615
Swear to me.

582
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:51,355
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

583
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:54,225
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

584
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:56,728
my heart is yours.

585
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,349
You really ought to knock.

586
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:19,652
I brought your breakfast.

587
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:39,195
It's getting dark.

588
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,397
We could stay here
for the night.

589
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,937
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

590
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:19,339
It doesn't matter.

591
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,808
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

592
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:43,596
He winked at me before.

593
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:48,434
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

594
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:50,836
He blinked.

595
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,672
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

596
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,807
between a wink and a blink.

597
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:58,343
A what?

598
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:03,982
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

599
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:09,054
A wink is on purpose.

600
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,726
You thought of a name yet?

601
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:20,600
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

602
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:23,803
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

603
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:26,506
What? No.

604
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,243
This is just the way I talk.

605
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,582
I'll build that fire.

606
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,359
Don't you think
he should have a name?

607
00:50:46,595 --> 00:50:49,664
I don't know many boys' names.

608
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,265
Let's see,

609
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,434
there's Duncan,

610
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,437
Kevan, Jon...

611
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,372
Guymon,

612
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:00,640
Feldan, Tristifer.

613
00:51:00,675 --> 00:51:03,376
Craster.

614
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,311
Uh, yes.

615
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,147
Maybe that's not...

616
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,182
Mormont.

617
00:51:10,216 --> 00:51:12,651
That's a lovely idea,

618
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,619
but Mormont's a last name.

619
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,555
Why is it a last name?

620
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,292
Well, it's a family name.

621
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:24,963
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

622
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:27,266
Samwell is my birth name

623
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,669
and Tarly is my family name.

624
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:35,173
You see? So my father
is also a Tarly.

625
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:38,777
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

626
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:41,714
No, Randyll Tarly.

627
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:43,783
Randyll is a handsome name.

628
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:46,820
Please don't name him Randyll.

629
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,959
Is your father cruel like mine?

630
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,934
Different manner of cruel.

631
00:52:12,815 --> 00:52:14,482
Not Randyll, then.

632
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:39,708
Don't.

633
00:52:39,742 --> 00:52:41,543
Don't go out there.

634
00:52:41,577 --> 00:52:43,511
I'll be back.

635
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:45,547
I just want to look.

636
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,050
Go inside.

637
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:25,419
Go back inside.
I'll...

638
00:53:39,168 --> 00:53:41,869
It's come for the baby.

639
00:53:57,052 --> 00:53:58,286
Stay back!

640
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:07,528
You stay back!

641
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:22,275
No, you can't
have him! No!

642
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:26,479
No!
