1
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,134
<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

2
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,736
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

3
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,972
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing...

4
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,308
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

5
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,177
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

6
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,645
Robb knows
I meant him no disr...

7
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:23,182
You're lucky I'm not your king.

8
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,381
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around

9
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,920
like a victory flag.

10
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,556
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

11
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,726
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

12
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,896
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

13
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,564
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

14
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,079
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

15
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,968
It's not about glory.

16
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,406
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

17
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,874
I seized an opportunity.

18
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,809
What value was the mill?

19
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,044
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

20
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,412
<i>Is he there now?</i>

21
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:53,648
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

22
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:54,915
He could not withstand us.

23
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,151
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

24
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:02,389
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

25
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,525
I wanted him to chase us,

26
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:08,028
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

27
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:10,263
without a strategic thought
in his head.

28
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:13,300
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

29
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:18,172
Instead, I have a mill.

30
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,576
<i>We took hostages.</i>

31
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:26,313
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

32
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,850
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

33
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:31,319
Martyn is 15, I believe.

34
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,728
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

35
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:40,696
Have I sued for peace?

36
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,231
No.

37
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,666
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

38
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,803
because we have his father's

39
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,705
brother's
great-grandsons?

40
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,878
No.

41
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,913
How many men did you lose?

42
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:00,649
208.

43
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:02,951
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters...

44
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,921
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

45
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,063
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:16,466
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

47
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,736
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

48
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,072
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

49
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:25,541
You know who isn't?

50
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:29,811
Tywin Lannister.

51
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:23,262
Intimate.
Lovely table.

52
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:26,098
<i>Better chairs than the old
small council chamber.</i>

53
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:29,568
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

54
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,438
What news of Jaime?

55
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,710
20,000 unwashed Northerners

56
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,779
have known about
his escape for weeks.

57
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,181
<i>Collectively, you control
more spies and informants</i>

58
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:45,116
than the rest
of the world combined.

59
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,052
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

60
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,188
has any notion of where he is?

61
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:52,191
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

62
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,462
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

63
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,366
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

64
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,169
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

65
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:08,307
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

66
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,910
which would seem to make
him Lord of Harrenhal,

67
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:14,064
- in practice if not in name.
- <i>Well, let him have it.</i>

68
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,946
The name suits our purposes

69
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,983
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

70
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,119
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

71
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:25,089
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

72
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,725
<i>Lady Arryn and I have known
each other since we were children.</i>

73
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,227
She has always been...

74
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,796
positively predisposed
toward me.

75
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:36,133
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

76
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,968
acting Lord of the Vale.

77
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,838
Titles do seem to breed titles.

78
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,040
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

79
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,842
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

80
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,878
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

81
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,747
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

82
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,584
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

83
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:57,155
<i>but Lord Baelish's absence
would present certain problems.</i>

84
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,090
The royal wedding may end up

85
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,993
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

86
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:05,163
<i>Summer has ended,
hard days lie ahead.</i>

87
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:09,034
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

88
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,236
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

89
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,373
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

90
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,308
Master of Coin?

91
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,977
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

92
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,946
I'm quite good
at spending money,

93
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:22,948
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

94
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,684
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

95
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:28,354
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

96
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:30,089
Hear, hear.

97
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:33,360
<i>♪ He lifted her
high in the air ♪</i>

98
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,595
♪ He sniffed and roared
and smelled her there ♪

99
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,964
♪ She kicked and wailed,
a maid so fair ♪

100
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,566
♪ But he licked the honey
from her hair ♪

101
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:43,336
♪ From there to here,
from here to there ♪

102
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,471
♪ All black and brown
and covered with hair ♪

103
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,640
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

104
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:50,843
♪ The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair... ♪

105
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,879
I hope you're pleased.

106
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:56,381
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

107
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:58,383
You were armed
when we were taken.

108
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,085
I was in chains if you recall.

109
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,020
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

110
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:03,988
if my hands weren't bound.

111
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:07,325
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister",

112
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:10,028
what a brilliant swordsman."

113
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,363
You were slower
than I expected.

114
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,132
And more predictable.

115
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,733
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

116
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,569
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

117
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,538
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

118
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,007
You were not beating me.

119
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,209
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

120
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,311
once.

121
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:29,414
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

122
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,888
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

123
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,456
More than once.

124
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:40,660
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

125
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:44,564
You'd be wise not to resist.

126
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,666
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

127
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,167
You think I care
about my teeth?

128
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:51,437
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

129
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,442
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

130
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,177
Do you understand?

131
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,947
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

132
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,282
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

133
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:05,518
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

134
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,353
Pretend they're Renly.

135
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:11,390
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

136
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,725
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

137
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,762
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

138
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,164
But I'm not, thank the gods.

139
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,804
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

140
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,739
Doesn't have to look pretty.

141
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,175
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

142
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,344
Why are you helping him?

143
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,579
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

144
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,215
<i>You're not our prisoner,
little lady.</i>

145
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,384
- What am I?
- Our guest.

146
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,486
No one's put any chains on you.

147
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,255
So I can walk away, then?

148
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:45,091
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

149
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,393
You're lucky we found you.

150
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:54,867
You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

151
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,468
Better than anyone
you've ever met.

152
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:58,436
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

153
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,605
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

154
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,076
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

155
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,446
Why?
So you can kiss him?

156
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,581
You remember the last time
you were here?

157
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:12,152
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

158
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,788
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

159
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:17,024
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

160
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,430
Watch your head.

161
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:24,865
Off we go.

162
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,202
<i>Walk up!</i>

163
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:34,307
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

164
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:35,808
I'm staying.

165
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:40,380
You're what?

166
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,682
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

167
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,551
and she said
she never had better.

168
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,453
Told Thoros she's keeping me
as a payment

169
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:47,955
for all the free meals
she's given him.

170
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,157
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

171
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:52,626
My brother ain't no king.

172
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:54,294
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

173
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,729
Winterfell.

174
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,232
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

175
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,404
Well, I made you something.

176
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,711
What is it?

177
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,980
It's a wolf.

178
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:19,052
Yes, it is.

179
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,688
That's the tail?

180
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,223
Yeah.

181
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,594
Well, be safe.

182
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,463
Yeah, you, too.

183
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:31,198
Don't get stabbed.

184
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:34,134
You don't...

185
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:36,003
burn your fingers.

186
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:48,482
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

187
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,784
Good-bye, Arry.

188
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,699
Up you go, little lady.

189
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:13,407
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

190
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,710
It's really good.

191
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:25,352
A person could
almost be forgiven

192
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:27,587
for forgetting we're at war.

193
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:34,427
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

194
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,296
in most places in the world

195
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,599
absolutely nothing
is happening.

196
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,971
I've missed you, Uncle.

197
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,973
Father missed you, too,

198
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:48,908
from the day you left.

199
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,110
Maybe he never said it
in so many words...

200
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,746
Maybe?

201
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,048
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

202
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,850
I was surprised when he died.

203
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:59,653
Didn't think death
had the patience.

204
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,592
I'm glad you were with him.

205
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,493
I wish to the gods I had been.

206
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:11,899
Did you make peace in the end?

207
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,735
After 30 years of fighting,

208
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,171
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

209
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:20,941
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

210
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,143
He said it was an old joke

211
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:25,679
and it was never funny
to begin with.

212
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:29,717
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

213
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:32,620
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

214
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,960
Every time he would leave
for the capital

215
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:41,729
or fight in a campaign,

216
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:43,897
I'd see him off.

217
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:47,033
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

218
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,236
"Wait for me

219
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:53,740
and I'll come back
to you."

220
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,309
And I would sit at this window

221
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,079
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

222
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,251
I wonder

223
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:08,020
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

224
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,989
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

225
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,191
waiting for me to return.

226
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,694
<i>I will never see them again.</i>

227
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,866
You mustn't think it.

228
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,201
We don't know the truth.

229
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:25,904
They could be in hiding.

230
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:31,711
Robb believes they're alive.

231
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,880
And he must go on believing.

232
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:36,683
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

233
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:40,787
And you must remain
strong for him.

234
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,566
You're Robb Stark's wife.

235
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,069
Hold still.

236
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,339
Is it true
what they say about him?

237
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,942
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

238
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:05,245
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

239
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:07,981
True.

240
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:10,250
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

241
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,252
True.

242
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:17,223
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

243
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,457
Martyn Lannister.

244
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,627
Martyn Lannister.

245
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:22,928
You've nothing to fear.

246
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:25,097
My husband
doesn't eat children.

247
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,201
Unless it's a full moon.

248
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,037
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

249
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,839
See?

250
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,109
Nothing to fear.

251
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:56,630
Always the artists.

252
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:18,488
It's only horses.

253
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,122
No men.

254
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,860
You said there was dead crows.

255
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:26,229
There was.

256
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,033
How many men were here?

257
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,269
About 300.

258
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,704
And you know
what those men are now?

259
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:41,778
We're all the same to them...
Meat for their army.

260
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:45,715
Do you think anyone got away?

261
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,250
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

262
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:49,652
<i>You don't go far
betting against Mormont.</i>

263
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,988
But dead or alive,

264
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:54,157
he took a big gamble
coming north.

265
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:56,258
<i>And he lost.</i>

266
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,627
His best fighting men are dead.

267
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:01,864
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

268
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,866
or a blue-eyed corpse,

269
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,702
he's a long way from home.

270
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:09,104
Tormund.

271
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:11,140
Climb the Wall.

272
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:14,243
Take Orell and 20 good men.

273
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,878
And take this one.

274
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:18,747
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

275
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,183
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

276
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,619
throw him off the Wall.

277
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:26,555
See if crows can fly.

278
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,892
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

279
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,494
Hide near Castle Black.

280
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:33,829
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

281
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:36,565
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

282
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,434
but it only guards one side.

283
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,637
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

284
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,839
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

285
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,042
How will we see your signal?

286
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,778
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

287
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:51,581
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

288
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,817
the North has ever seen.

289
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,648
Ghost?

290
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,597
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

291
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,633
We've come a long way.

292
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:46,405
<i>Smaller flock
than you went north with.</i>

293
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,541
We can talk inside.

294
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,677
Oh, can we?

295
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,266
<i>They need some water.</i>

296
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,469
<i>Tether it and I'll be inside.</i>

297
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,252
<i>Keep your eyes
where they belong.</i>

298
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,821
They're not for you.

299
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,323
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

300
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,794
Aye, pig's got value to me.

301
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,697
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

302
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,869
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

303
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,237
You are a godly man?

304
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,708
I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.

305
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,743
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

306
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,914
<i>your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.</i>

307
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:07,185
The only ones left will be
those who are right with the gods.

308
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,786
The real gods.

309
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,061
Go tell her she can
bite down on a rag

310
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,764
or she can bite down
on my fist.

311
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,271
Women.

312
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,173
That sow right there gave birth

313
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,508
<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

314
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,677
Barely a grunt.

315
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:37,048
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

316
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,651
Now why don't you dine on him?

317
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,320
Carve off what you need
as you go.

318
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,489
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

319
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,975
<i>Here we are.</i>

320
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,378
<i>Sharpen these for me, would ya?</i>

321
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,965
<i>I see the head.
Push.</i>

322
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,767
That's it.

323
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,137
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

324
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,543
One more push should do it.

325
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,857
What is it?
What is it?

326
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,824
Keep quiet.

327
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:56,891
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

328
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,960
I can ride.

329
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:01,263
You're sure?

330
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,045
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

331
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,481
<i>Your sister's waiting for you.</i>

332
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:22,216
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

333
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,411
We're not in the Iron Islands.

334
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,987
- Go.
- Come on.

335
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,622
Come on.
Come on.

336
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:29,590
Come on. Come on.

337
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,463
<i>Come on back.</i>

338
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,368
<i>You refuse to tell me
where you're going?</i>

339
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:44,504
<i>I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.</i>

340
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:47,273
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

341
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,976
You're abandoning me.

342
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,178
I will never abandon you.

343
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:56,149
You are the Son of Fire.

344
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,718
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

345
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,920
When I return,
you will understand.

346
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:05,525
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

347
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,596
They're laughing at me

348
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,133
the way Renly laughed at me.

349
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,735
I want Joffrey dead.

350
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,272
I want Robb Stark dead.

351
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,877
Make me another son.

352
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,512
I cannot.

353
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:26,747
Why?

354
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:29,817
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

355
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:32,720
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

356
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,894
I want you.

357
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:56,480
Your fires burn low, my king.

358
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:03,420
There is another way.
A better way.

359
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:06,022
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

360
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,657
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

361
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,258
You are.

362
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:11,527
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

363
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,733
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

364
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,902
but first there must
be sacrifices.

365
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:21,738
The Lord of Light demands it.

366
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:35,685
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

367
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:38,821
- To whom?
- To any slave who contemplates doing

368
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:41,523
whatever these slaves did.

369
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:44,059
Give me your water.

370
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:47,796
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

371
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:56,071
Here, drink.

372
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:00,642
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

373
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:02,244
Leave tonight, I beg you.

374
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:03,779
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

375
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:07,282
<i>We can find sellswords
in Pentos and Myr.</i>

376
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,786
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

377
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,623
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

378
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:16,859
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

379
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:20,095
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

380
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,634
How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

381
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:27,902
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

382
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:30,305
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

383
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:38,013
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

384
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:41,182
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

385
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:43,585
Babies, children, old men.

386
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:46,021
More women raped
than you can count.

387
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:47,655
There's a beast in every man

388
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,659
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

389
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:53,061
But the Unsullied are not men.

390
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,729
They do not rape.

391
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,833
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

392
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:02,537
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

393
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:04,038
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

394
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:07,142
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

395
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:09,811
men died for him
because they believed in him,

396
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:11,546
because they loved him,

397
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:14,049
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

398
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:18,620
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

399
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,458
I bled beside him.

400
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:26,028
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

401
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,897
and Rhaegar died.

402
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,468
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

403
00:30:31,502 --> 00:30:36,039
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

404
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,275
I wish I had known him.

405
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,343
But he was not the last dragon.

406
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:52,335
All?

407
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,956
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

408
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:57,729
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

409
00:30:57,763 --> 00:30:59,931
_

410
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:02,241
_

411
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:06,083
_

412
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:11,676
_

413
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:16,014
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

414
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,782
Is this what you mean by all?

415
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:19,717
Yes. 8,000.

416
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:22,053
<i>And the ones
still in training as well.</i>

417
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:27,085
_

418
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:30,316
_

419
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:34,833
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

420
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,168
<i>If they fail
on the battlefield,</i>

421
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:39,437
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

422
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:41,339
I will have them all
or take none.

423
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,564
Many will fall in battle.

424
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,641
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

425
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,495
_

426
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,504
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

427
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,935
_

428
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:59,624
Your ship will buy you
100 Unsullied.

429
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:04,496
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

430
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,426
<i>The gold you have left
is worth 10.</i>

431
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:12,737
But good Master Kraznys
will give you 20.

432
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:17,308
The Dothraki
you have with you...

433
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:21,132
_

434
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:25,450
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

435
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:28,019
<i>but Master Kraznys will give
you three Unsullied</i>

436
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,621
<i>for all of them.</i>

437
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,803
_

438
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:33,758
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay

439
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:39,398
for the remaining
7,877 Unsullied.

440
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:47,339
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

441
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:54,113
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

442
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,848
Khaleesi, please.

443
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,492
Three dragons.

444
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,794
- One.
- Two.

445
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,162
One.

446
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,907
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

447
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,376
- Done.
- Done.

448
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,750
I'll take you as well, now.

449
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:35,720
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

450
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,889
A token of a bargain
well struck.

451
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:43,017
_

452
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:48,480
_

453
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,735
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth
more than any army.

454
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,038
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

455
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:57,641
You're both here to advise me.

456
00:33:57,676 --> 00:33:59,662
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me

457
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:01,212
in front of strangers again,

458
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,747
you'll be advising
someone else.

459
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:06,083
Is that understood?

460
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,554
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

461
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:13,223
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

462
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:15,459
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

463
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:17,494
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

464
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,831
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

465
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:24,001
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

466
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:26,603
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

467
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:30,007
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

468
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,762
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

469
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:36,046
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

470
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,949
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

471
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:41,618
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

472
00:34:41,653 --> 00:34:44,788
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

473
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:47,357
All questions have been
taken from them.

474
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:49,258
They obey, that is all.

475
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:52,061
<i>Once they are yours,
they are yours.</i>

476
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:54,162
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

477
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:57,666
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

478
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,836
<i>You may go hungry.
You may fall sick.</i>

479
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,005
You may be killed.

480
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,741
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

481
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:09,344
Yes, all men must die.

482
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,514
But we are not men.

483
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,994
<i>A surprising place to keep
the royal ledgers.</i>

484
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:28,130
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

485
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:33,168
This is the safest place
in the city.

486
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:35,104
Not for bastards.

487
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:37,440
That's all of them, my lord.

488
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:40,577
<i>Thank you, my dear.
Pod.</i>

489
00:35:41,545 --> 00:35:43,780
Pod.
Take them outside.

490
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:46,516
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

491
00:35:57,294 --> 00:36:00,564
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

492
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,399
Only my life.

493
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:04,367
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

494
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:06,436
You should have him knighted.

495
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,639
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

496
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:12,742
If only.

497
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:16,880
I owe you a significant debt.

498
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:19,282
Our redheaded friend.

499
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:22,084
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

500
00:36:22,118 --> 00:36:24,086
Oh, that.

501
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:27,289
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

502
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,091
Apparently, Her Grace believed

503
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:33,162
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

504
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,132
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

505
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,200
- I know.
- But we don't.

506
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,869
I know.

507
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,604
But how would the queen
get that idea?

508
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:44,407
Why don't you ask her?

509
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:49,879
Any advice for me
on my new position?

510
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,849
Keep a low profile.

511
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:56,152
If I had a gold dragon

512
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:59,255
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

513
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,157
Well, you are richer than I am.

514
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:03,226
Good point.

515
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:06,596
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

516
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,100
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

517
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,669
Trivial even.

518
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:13,471
You want a real challenge?

519
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:14,906
Try whores.

520
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,509
I've tried quite a few.

521
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:20,011
Well, lots of work to do.

522
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,781
Enjoy the Eyrie.

523
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:24,816
Come on, I'm here later.

524
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,685
Come on.

525
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:31,757
Tonight, then.

526
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,794
Looks like dull reading.

527
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:38,096
You think all reading
is dull reading.

528
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,999
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

529
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,633
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

530
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,272
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

531
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,873
to hide what he's really up to.

532
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,942
Unless he made it all up, yes.

533
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,378
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

534
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:54,680
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

535
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:58,084
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

536
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:00,019
I finally found
a suitable reward

537
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:02,355
for the services you've
provided over and above

538
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,957
<i>what might be
considered reasonable.</i>

539
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,393
Tell me, Pod,

540
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,196
have you ever been
with a woman?

541
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,765
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

542
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:17,204
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

543
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:19,973
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

544
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,975
Uh, my lord...

545
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,445
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

546
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,680
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

547
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:31,586
Now, as it happens,

548
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,122
Marei...

549
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:37,425
is quite the spear
handler herself.

550
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,996
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

551
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,766
as the battle raged
all around me.

552
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,635
He's handsome.

553
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:48,972
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

554
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:53,911
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

555
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,180
in certain circles.

556
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:58,816
<i>One of four women in the world</i>

557
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:02,587
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

558
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,690
My lord, I don't even...

559
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:07,459
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

560
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:10,228
<i>for being a thoroughly
respectful fellow</i>

561
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:13,065
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

562
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:18,270
Be back in time for my supper.

563
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:25,476
Pace yourself, lad.

564
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,945
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

565
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,348
is a magician.

566
00:39:30,382 --> 00:39:33,351
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

567
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:36,020
and, poof, mountains of gold.

568
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:38,456
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

569
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:40,425
No.

570
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,863
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

571
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,499
What's wrong with that?

572
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:51,202
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

573
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:53,571
The crown owes millions
to my father.

574
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:55,940
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

575
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:57,942
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

576
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:00,277
Forgive a debt, my father?

577
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:02,746
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

578
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:04,715
I've never borrowed
money before.

579
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,117
I'm not clear on the rules.

580
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:08,586
Well...

581
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,821
<i>Ahem!</i>

582
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,159
The basic principle is

583
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,694
I lend you money,

584
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:19,264
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

585
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:21,900
you return it with interest.

586
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:23,401
And what if I don't?

587
00:40:23,435 --> 00:40:25,503
Well, you have to.

588
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:26,870
But what if I don't?

589
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:29,239
This is why
I don't lend you money.

590
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:32,776
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

591
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,778
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

592
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,513
We owe them tens of millions.

593
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:41,050
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

594
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:44,220
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

595
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,792
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

596
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:51,295
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

597
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,963
The lad's practically skipping.

598
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:54,665
You were gone a long time.

599
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,500
I trust you got
your money's worth.

600
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:58,168
Or should I say
my money's worth?

601
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,939
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.

602
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,708
This is more than
I give you in a year.

603
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,711
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

604
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,246
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

605
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,181
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

606
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:15,684
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

607
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,086
<i>with the new Master of Coin.</i>

608
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,221
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

609
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,790
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

610
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:23,525
What did you tell them?

611
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:25,126
I didn't tell them anything.

612
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:28,230
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

613
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:30,198
And they seemed
to like these things?

614
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:31,767
Yes, my lord.

615
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:33,502
<i>Of course
they seemed to like it.</i>

616
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,037
They're paid
to seem to like it.

617
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:37,306
Only they weren't paid.

618
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,276
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

619
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,911
they gave him
the time for free?

620
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,313
Is that what you're telling us?

621
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:50,152
Sit down, Podrick.

622
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:59,193
We're going to need details.

623
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,630
Copious details.

624
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,906
Come on!
Come on!

625
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,410
Come on!

626
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:50,479
Come on.

627
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:28,483
Ha! Ha!

628
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:18,970
You know how we deal
with runaways here, do you?

629
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:27,880
Take off his pants.

630
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,317
No! No!

631
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,985
No, no, no!

632
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,120
I'm gonna fuck you
into the dirt.

633
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:36,656
No, please!
No, no, no!

634
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,257
No, don't!

635
00:44:40,828 --> 00:44:42,561
<i>No, please!</i>

636
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,197
<i>No! No!</i>

637
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:16,697
You little bastard.

638
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,575
Come, my lord.

639
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,581
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

640
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:02,708
I'll take the big bitch first.

641
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:06,111
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

642
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:08,613
<i>My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.</i>

643
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:10,982
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

644
00:46:11,016 --> 00:46:13,685
to deliver Ser Jaime
to King's Landing.

645
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:15,653
Catelyn Stark's
a treasonous cunt.

646
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:17,655
<i>Orders were to take
the Kingslayer alive.</i>

647
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:19,857
Nobody said shit about you.

648
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:26,964
You're only making it worse.

649
00:46:31,103 --> 00:46:33,738
<i>Take her over there
where it's dark.</i>

650
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,173
I'd like a little privacy.

651
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:39,210
Come on!

652
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,057
You know who she is, don't you?

653
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:57,997
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

654
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,134
Never been with
a woman that big.

655
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:04,937
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

656
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,674
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

657
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,309
Heard of Tarth?

658
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:12,178
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

659
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:15,214
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

660
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,251
Every sapphire in Westeros

661
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:19,819
was mined on Tarth.

662
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:23,323
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

663
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:26,659
- <i>The blue ones.</i>
- I know what they are.

664
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:30,430
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

665
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:33,166
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

666
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,436
<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

667
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,372
her honor unbesmirched.

668
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,817
Bring her back here.

669
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,252
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

670
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:55,788
<i>- Get up.
- Come on.</i>

671
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,458
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

672
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,894
<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

673
00:48:03,396 --> 00:48:05,631
Not defiled.

674
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:08,433
Fancy word for a fancy man.

675
00:48:09,535 --> 00:48:12,170
I hated to read as a child,

676
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:15,006
<i>but my father forced me
to study the books every morning</i>

677
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,210
<i>before I could practice
with sword or horse.</i>

678
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:21,613
Two hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

679
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:25,083
I learned a lot of fancy words.

680
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:27,319
I bet you did.

681
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,496
Your father,

682
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:40,399
he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

683
00:48:41,901 --> 00:48:44,837
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

684
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:46,739
<i>And your sons will be rich men</i>

685
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:49,107
<i>and their sons after them.</i>

686
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:51,444
Lands, titles...

687
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:53,746
You'll have them all.

688
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:58,551
The North can't win this war.

689
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,153
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

690
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,888
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

691
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,991
Aye, you have both.

692
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,462
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

693
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,331
is admirable.

694
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,034
Fighting for a winning cause

695
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:16,569
is far more rewarding.

696
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:19,005
Hard to argue with that.

697
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:25,246
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

698
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,484
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

699
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

700
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:35,757
but if I could sleep
lying down,

701
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,593
my back would thank you for it.

702
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,662
I'm not as young

703
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:42,364
and resilient as I was once.

704
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,400
None of us are.

705
00:49:46,703 --> 00:49:48,905
<i>Unchain Ser Jaime
from the tree.</i>

706
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:51,374
<i>Come on, men.</i>

707
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,116
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

708
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:02,018
I'm famished, actually.

709
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:05,155
<i>I think we've got a spare
partridge on the fire.</i>

710
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,992
Well, I do like partridge.

711
00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:17,402
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

712
00:50:20,906 --> 00:50:23,341
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

713
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:25,243
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic...

714
00:50:25,278 --> 00:50:27,379
Ah!

715
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,581
On the stump.

716
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:38,890
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

717
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,994
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

718
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,130
and lick your boots.

719
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:48,665
- My father...
- And if you get in any trouble,

720
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:51,568
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

721
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:54,637
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

722
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,142
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

723
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,448
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

724
00:51:09,786 --> 00:51:12,488
You're nothing
without your daddy,

725
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:15,958
and your daddy ain't here.

726
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,427
Never forget that.

727
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:22,452
Here, this should
help you remember.
