<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,964
We shouldn't be out here alone.

3
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,041
Why not?

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,121
If your father...

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,964
He'll never know we're gone.

6
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,565
But if he finds out...

7
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,491
You don't need to be afraid of my father.

8
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,163
Are you sure?

9
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,761
Yes.

10
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,970
We shouldn't go in.

11
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,327
Of course we should.

12
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,129
Get out! Get out!

13
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,247
- Let's go.
- No.

14
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Listen to your friend.

15
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,727
They said that you were terrifying,

16
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,929
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,002
You're not terrifying.

18
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,284
You're boring.

19
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,403
You don't know what I am.

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,768
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

21
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,210
Tell me mine.

22
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,601
Everyone wants to know their future

23
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,284
until they know their future.

24
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,921
This is my father's land. My land.

25
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,446
Tell me my future,

26
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,286
or I'll have your two boring eyes
gouged out of your head.

27
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,284
Your blood.

28
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,441
Give me a taste.

29
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,482
Three questions you get.

30
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,447
You won't like the answers.

31
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,566
I've been promised to the prince.

32
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,369
When will we marry?

33
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,283
You will never wed the prince.

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,403
You will wed the king.

35
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,005
But I will be queen?

36
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh, yes.

37
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,163
You'll be queen.

38
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,410
For a time.

39
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,921
Then comes another,

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,001
younger,

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,763
more beautiful,

42
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,004
to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

43
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,048
Will the king and I have children?

44
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,125
No. The king will have 20 children,

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
and you will have three.

46
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,647
That doesn't make sense.

47
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,290
Gold will be their crowns.

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,805
Gold their shrouds.

49
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,805
Come on, we have to go.

50
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,130
We have to go! Cersei.

51
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,329
Bearers, put it down.

52
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,608
Bearers, up.

53
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,611
Away.

54
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,165
Your Grace, we are honored
by your presence.

55
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,401
The mourners are waiting.

56
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,084
They will keep waiting.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,889
I want a moment alone with him.

58
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,610
But, Your Grace,
many of these lords and ladies

59
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,923
have traveled day and night
to be here from all seven kingdoms.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,445
They Will wait.

61
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,530
He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,

62
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,482
but here you are, protecting his dead body.

63
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,364
What he built, it's ours.

64
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,406
He built it for us. He meant it for us.

65
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,365
- They're going to try to take it away. All of it.
- They?

66
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,205
All of them out there. Our enemies.

67
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,842
They're waiting in line
to make sure he's really dead.

68
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,763
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,524
they'll set to work on tearing us apart.

70
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,365
They have nothing to do with it.

71
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,602
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

72
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,967
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

73
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,530
You've been defending him for years.

74
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,931
This is exactly what they want.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,002
And now our father is dead,

76
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,289
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

77
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,842
Did you set him free?

78
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,169
Tyrion may be a monster,
but at least he killed our father on purpose.

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,241
You killed him by mistake.

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,002
With stupidity.

81
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,004
You're a man of action, aren't you?

82
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,208
When it occurs to you to do something,
you do it.

83
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,648
Never mind the consequences.

84
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,409
Take a look.

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,963
Look at the consequences.

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,242
Here they are.

87
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,129
He loved you more than anyone in this world.

88
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,363
Apologies.

89
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,481
I still don't see why I had to stay
in this fucking crate once we set sail.

90
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,528
I saved your life.

91
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,251
If they catch you, they catch me.

92
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,405
I cannot say I feel overly guilty
about leaving you in that fucking crate.

93
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,883
Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit
through one of those air holes?

94
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,204
No, I only know what it's like
to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

95
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,205
Pentos?

96
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,689
The home of my colleague,
Illyrio Mopatis, a merchant.

97
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,731
He and I met many years ago
through mutual friends.

98
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,646
A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon
for the disaster he was.

99
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,561
We tried to do what was best for the realm
by supporting a Targaryen restoration.

100
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,242
And thus began the chain of mistakes
that has led us both here.

101
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,201
Things have gotten worse, not better.

102
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,489
Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

103
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,241
Mmm.

104
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,491
Much better.

105
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,484
My lord?

106
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,886
I don't think I am anymore.

107
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,489
A lord.

108
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,124
Are you a lord if you kill your father?

109
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,725
I don't imagine they revoke your nobility
for killing a whore.

110
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,604
It must happen all the time.

111
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,808
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

112
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,248
In a box. Why stop now?

113
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,244
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

114
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,210
The future is shit.

115
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,002
Just like the past.

116
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,166
You want the same?

117
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,846
Same as always?

118
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,006
You...

119
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,924
you don't have to.

120
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,845
Habit.

121
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,250
The Sons of the Harpy?

122
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,322
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

123
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,164
They've never killed before.

124
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,447
It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.

125
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,727
Conquerors always meet with resistance.

126
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,121
I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.

127
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,328
They do not see us as people, Your Grace.

128
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,486
Then they will have to learn to see
things differently, Mossador.

129
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,841
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

130
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,570
so cowards in masks could take it away.

131
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,968
And I did not take up residence
in this pyramid

132
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,965
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

133
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,202
What was the name of the man you lost?

134
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,926
White Rat, Your Grace.

135
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,164
I want him buried with honor, publically,

136
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,601
in the Temple of the Graces.

137
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,688
The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

138
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,290
Make them very angry.

139
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,362
Angry snakes lash out.

140
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,171
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

141
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,290
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

142
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,765
Your Grace.

143
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,811
I wanted to speak with you.

144
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,201
Why do you come?

145
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,329
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

146
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,284
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

147
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,290
I have heard that more than one Unsullied
has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.

148
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,849
May I ask you why?

149
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,326
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

150
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,642
I do not know.

151
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,204
I must go.

152
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,843
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

153
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,049
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.
Now get it up.

154
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,246
Come. Try it again.

155
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,245
Drive at me. Keep your shield up,
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

156
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,882
Shouldn't you be training, too?

157
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,763
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

158
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,801
How many brothers can say that
they've killed a White Walker and a Thenn?

159
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,325
I might be the first in history.

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,843
- Shield up.
- These men need a firm hand.

161
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,687
Always have.

162
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,645
They're poachers and thieves.

163
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,289
Not soldiers.

164
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,007
That one hates me.

165
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,241
If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

166
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,811
He hates the wildlings.

167
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,645
All the wildlings.

168
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,882
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

169
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,770
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

170
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,560
and people say he's a good man.
He's running against Ser Alliser...

171
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,001
Sam, don't let them send us away.

172
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,249
I told you.

173
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,802
Wherever you go, I go, too.

174
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,042
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

175
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,890
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

176
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,761
Shield up.

177
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,488
The king wants a word.

178
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,921
You're not cold, my lady?

179
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,324
Never.

180
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,084
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

181
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,361
Feel.

182
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,967
Are you a virgin?

183
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,131
No.

184
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,486
Good.

185
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,171
Your Grace.

186
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,406
The bastard of Winterfell.

187
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,963
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

188
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,566
Roose Bolton.

189
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,730
Hmm. The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

190
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,565
Don't you want to avenge him?

191
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,202
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

192
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,408
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

193
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,850
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

194
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,570
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

195
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,324
Many don't.

196
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,440
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

197
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,046
Why?

198
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,690
It's where she belonged.

199
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,082
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

200
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,323
They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.

201
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,164
That doesn't make them monsters.

202
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,321
No matter.

203
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,971
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

204
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,651
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

205
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,805
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

206
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,763
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

207
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,806
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

208
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,928
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.

209
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,929
I'm talking about the wildlings.

210
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,125
Your Grace,

211
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,762
you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

212
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,569
If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.

213
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,687
We'll take Winterfell.

214
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,491
Once the North is won,
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

215
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,891
I'll give them land to live on.

216
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,128
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

217
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,089
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom

218
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,130
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

219
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,641
I don't think that's likely.

220
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,281
You admire him, don't you?

221
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,850
I respect him.

222
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
He likes you.

223
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,403
- Convince him to bend the knee, or he burns.
- Your Grace.

224
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,891
How much time do I have?

225
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
Nightfall.

226
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,847
The sun drops fast this time of year.

227
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,684
Hurry, Jon Snow.

228
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,967
Shield up.

229
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,523
Attack, my lord!

230
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,244
Attack!

231
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,967
Don't cross your feet.

232
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,769
My sons had swords in their hands
from the time they could walk. This one...

233
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,043
Lord Arryn
will never be a great warrior.

234
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,963
Great warrior?

235
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,651
He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.

236
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,887
My lord.

237
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,410
Sword up, my lord!

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,849
Some boys
develop more slowly.

239
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,127
He's still young.

240
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,204
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

241
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,806
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

242
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,008
The gift of a great name.

243
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,642
Sometimes that's all one needs.

244
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,490
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

245
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,961
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

246
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,405
I have no doubt that on my return,

247
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,131
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

248
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,365
He'll be safe here.

249
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,248
As for his skills,

250
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,727
I make no promises.

251
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,682
Will we head north at some point?

252
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,287
He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.

253
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,647
We're a few days' ride from the King's Road.

254
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,087
- But that will take us...
- Us?

255
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,126
The only reason you're here

256
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,090
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

257
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,164
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

258
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,163
No one knows what you look like.

259
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,244
No one cares. You're safe.

260
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,085
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

261
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,407
An attendant to a knight.

262
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,045
I'm not a knight.

263
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,248
That means you're not a squire.

264
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,641
Well, where would I go?

265
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,371
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

266
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,083
You swore to find the Stark girls.

267
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,846
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

268
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,161
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

269
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,282
I didn't ask for your advice.

270
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,047
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

271
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,486
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

272
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,801
The good lords are dead,
and the rest are monsters.

273
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,846
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

274
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,285
I did.

275
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,085
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

276
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,288
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

277
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,523
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

278
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,807
but he's not alone in that castle.

279
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,925
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

280
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,163
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

281
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,084
No.

282
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,921
But I pay them well,

283
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,446
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

284
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,646
So where are we going?

285
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,247
To a land where you trust everyone?

286
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,971
To a land so far from here,

287
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,930
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

288
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,207
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

289
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,483
Your father was a...

290
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,370
A force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

291
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,203
I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

292
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,805
But just being in his presence was enough

293
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,484
to make it so clear

294
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,730
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

295
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,562
What a force to be reckoned with.

296
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,287
Thank you so much for your kind words.

297
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

298
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,564
This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
I often warned...

299
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,401
Your Grace.

300
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,681
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

301
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,001
My deepest sympathies.

302
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,210
I apologize for my son's appearance.

303
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,725
Uncle, that's quite all right.

304
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,405
They call themselves Sparrows.

305
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,289
Bloody fanatics.

306
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,331
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

307
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,084
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

308
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,448
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
whatever it is.

309
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,288
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

310
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,286
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

311
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,569
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

312
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,483
What can I do for you?

313
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,802
You can forgive me.

314
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,406
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

315
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,167
I led you into the darkness.

316
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,726
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

317
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,610
I tempted you into our...

318
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,125
unnatural relations.

319
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,648
And, of course, there was the king,

320
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,648
his boar hunt.

321
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,327
His wine.

322
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,481
I don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,282
I'm a different person now.

324
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,684
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

325
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,246
You can, too.

326
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,166
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy

327
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,921
or justice.

328
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,762
Their world is at hand.

329
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
I will pray for your father's soul.

330
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,561
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

331
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,446
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

332
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
It does.

333
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,730
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

334
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,405
And that's where the mountains are.

335
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,562
And over here is...

336
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,806
Is Sunsnake?

337
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,207
Stonespear?

338
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,884
Sandstone.

339
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,450
Yes.

340
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,761
Yes, Sandstone.

341
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,561
Just there.

342
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,286
Fine.

343
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,725
It's Dorne.

344
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
We should go there.

345
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,649
I think we would have a lovely time,

346
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,808
Judging by my experience.

347
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,881
That would be wonderful.

348
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,561
Dorne, Highgarden.

349
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,809
Anywhere but here.

350
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,450
We're late for dinner as it is.

351
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,927
You're very respectful.

352
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,809
I'm very hungry.

353
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,410
What's your name?

354
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,810
Olyvar, my lady.

355
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,126
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

356
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,931
My lady.

357
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

358
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,004
Why?

359
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,048
They all know about me anyway.

360
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,489
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

361
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,608
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

362
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,729
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

363
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,170
My intended? Please.

364
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,931
Tywin's dead.

365
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,968
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

366
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,929
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

367
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,162
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

368
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,006
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

369
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,208
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

370
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,366
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

371
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,681
Perhaps.

372
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,841
Perhaps?

373
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,049
Perhaps.

374
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,291
Eunuch, the spider, the Master of Whisperers.

375
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,967
Imp, halfman.

376
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,209
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

377
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,243
Not for a coward.

378
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,369
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

379
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,881
You never told me why

380
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,366
you set me free.

381
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,522
Your brother asked me to.

382
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,004
Could have said no.

383
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,367
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

384
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,681
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

385
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,321
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

386
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,324
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

387
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,767
I didn't do it for you.

388
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,842
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

389
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,163
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

390
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,288
I don't believe in saviors.

391
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,802
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

392
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,330
You're going to have to find another soldier.

393
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,205
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

394
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,811
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

395
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,402
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

396
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,280
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

397
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,571
I'm not well-suited for work.

398
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,051
I think you are.

399
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,805
You have your father's
instincts for politics,

400
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,041
and you have compassion.

401
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,407
Compassion? Yes.

402
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,843
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

403
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,810
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

404
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,849
I never said you were perfect.

405
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,804
What is it you want exactly?

406
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,370
Peace.

407
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,810
Prosperity.

408
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,203
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

409
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,521
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

410
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,171
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

411
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,602
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

412
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,001
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

413
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,923
Perhaps.

414
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,245
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

415
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,762
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

416
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,127
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

417
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,931
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

418
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,764
No, you won't.

419
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,971
But you could help another climb those steps
and take that seat.

420
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,884
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

421
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,281
but gentler than Stannis.

422
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,762
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

423
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,847
A ruler loved by millions with a
powerful army and the right family name.

424
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,202
Good luck finding him.

425
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,367
Who said anything about "him"?

426
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,408
You have a choice, my friend.

427
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,202
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
and drink yourself to death,

428
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,807
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

429
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,406
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

430
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,841
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

431
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,084
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

432
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,164
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

433
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,004
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

434
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,367
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

435
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,002
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

436
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,129
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

437
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,850
Good.

438
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,445
They did ask for some concessions.

439
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,891
Concessions?

440
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,122
Politics is the art of compromise,
Your Grace.

441
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,090
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

442
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,211
Forgive me. You're right, of course.

443
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,166
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

444
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,802
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

445
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,123
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

446
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,124
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

447
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,885
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

448
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,405
The fighting pits?

449
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,006
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

450
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,165
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

451
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,122
The pit fighters you liberated
pled for this opportunity.

452
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,643
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

453
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,721
No fighting pits.

454
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,321
Opening them would
show the people of Yunkai and Meereen

455
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
that you respect their traditions.

456
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,084
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

457
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,247
If you...

458
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,607
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

459
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,405
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

460
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,926
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

461
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,240
You should reopen the fighting pits.

462
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,290
What?

463
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,886
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

464
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,286
She liked to drink pear brandy.

465
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,930
The older she got,

466
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,004
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

467
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,764
So one day when I was 12,

468
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,003
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

469
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,044
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,771
Why? I was a bad child.

471
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,647
I wasn't big, but I was quick

472
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,926
and I loved to fight.

473
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,289
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

474
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,806
I had my first match when I was 16.

475
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,605
You were sold into slavery,

476
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,126
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

477
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,282
and you're defending the fighting pits?

478
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm only here because of those pits.

479
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,721
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

480
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,451
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

481
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,846
Soon I was famous.

482
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,925
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

483
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,971
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

484
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,528
I joined the Second Sons,

485
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,250
and then I met you.

486
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,203
You're the queen.

487
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,681
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

488
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,247
Everyone but me.

489
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,402
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

490
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,165
As soon as they see weakness,

491
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,924
they'll attack.

492
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,842
Show your strength here, now.

493
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,161
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

494
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,923
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

495
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,046
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

496
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,650
You're the Mother of Dragons.

497
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,765
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

498
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,126
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

499
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,131
For all I know,
he's flown halfway across the world.

500
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,889
I can't control them anymore.

501
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,284
A dragon queen with no dragons

502
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,162
is not a queen.

503
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,649
Viserion?

504
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,929
Rhaegal?

505
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,006
Easy. Easy.

506
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,930
Easy.

507
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,048
So here we are.

508
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,122
Here we are.

509
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,011
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

510
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,163
And now, for our last meeting...

511
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,567
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

512
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,166
No, but it will be.

513
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,961
You know what Stannis wants?

514
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
He wants me to bend the knee.

515
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,967
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

516
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,130
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

517
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,884
Shouldn't a king be bold?

518
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,805
Oh, aye.

519
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,010
I respect him.

520
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,210
If he gets what he wants,
I expect he'll be a better ruler

521
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,126
than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

522
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,567
But I'll never serve him.

523
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,725
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

524
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
You told me your people have bled enough.

525
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,491
That's right.

526
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,687
I don't want them
bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

527
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,563
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to
come together for the first time in history.

528
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,688
Thenns and Hornfoots,

529
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,604
the ice-river clans, even the giants.

530
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,649
A life's work uniting them.

531
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,845
You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

532
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,850
You brought them together to save them

533
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,523
because none of them will survive the winter,
not if they're north of the Wall.

534
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,768
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

535
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,049
Pride?

536
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,208
Fuck my pride.

537
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,568
This isn't about that.

538
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,046
Then bend the knee and save your people.

539
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,128
They followed me because they respected me.

540
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,964
Because they believed in me.

541
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,281
The moment I kneel for a southern king,
that's all gone.

542
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,648
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

543
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,888
How many women?
How many children?

544
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,049
And you won't go out
and rescue them because why?

545
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,123
You're afraid of looking afraid.

546
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,530
Oh, I am afraid.

547
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,931
No shame in that.

548
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,840
How will they do it?

549
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,605
Beheading?

550
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,045
Hanging?

551
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,245
They'll burn you alive.

552
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,208
Bad way to go.

553
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,763
I'll be honest with you.

554
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,002
I don't want to die.

555
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,684
And burned to death?

556
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,607
I don't want people to remember me like that,
scorched and screaming.

557
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,003
But it's better than
betraying everything I believe.

558
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,489
And what happens to your people?

559
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,562
You preserve your dignity and die standing,

560
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,768
and they'll sing songs about you.

561
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,441
You'd rather burn than kneel.

562
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,204
The great hero.

563
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,648
Until winter comes,
and the White Walkers come for us all,

564
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,121
and there's no one left to sing.

565
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,288
You're a good lad.

566
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,801
Truly you are.

567
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,164
But if you can't understand

568
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,290
why I won't enlist my people
in a foreigner's war,

569
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,881
there's no point explaining.

570
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,849
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

571
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,565
The freedom to make my own mistakes
was all I ever wanted.

572
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,167
Mance Rayder, you have been
called the King-beyond-the-Wall.

573
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Westeros only has one king.

574
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,282
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

575
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,764
Kneel and live.

576
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,088
This was my home for many years.

577
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,887
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

578
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,324
We all must choose.

579
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,087
Man or woman, young or old,

580
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,448
lord or peasant, our choices are the same.

581
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,286
We choose light, or we choose darkness.

582
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,045
We choose good, or we choose evil.

583
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,690
We choose the true god or the false.

584
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,650
Free folk,

585
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,083
there is only one true king,

586
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,200
and his name is Stannis.

587
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,601
Here stands your king of lies.

588
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,843
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

589
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:38,500
