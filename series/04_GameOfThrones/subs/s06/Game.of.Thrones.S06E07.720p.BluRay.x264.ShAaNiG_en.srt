1
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:11,984
<i>That's it. Get
it right to the top.</i>

2
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:14,887
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

3
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,856
Up she goes.

4
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,592
Hey, come on.
Put your back into it, huh?

5
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:56,662
Here you are, son.

6
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,535
- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

7
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:04,670
And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

8
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:07,173
Come on, come on.

10
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,373
In all my days I've never seen
a man swing an axe like that.

11
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:57,977
How many men did it take
to cut you down?

12
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,112
Just one.

13
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,680
Ooh.

14
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,049
He must have been
some kind of monster.

15
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,386
He was a woman.

16
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,830
I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

17
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,933
I'm used to it.

18
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,875
When I found you, I thought
you'd been dead for days.

19
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,011
The way you were stinking already

20
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,813
and you had bugs all over you

21
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:05,582
and bone was coming
through right there.

22
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:11,303
I was gonna give you a proper
burial and then you coughed.

23
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,742
Oh, nearly shit myself.

24
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,544
<i>I reckoned you were gonna die</i>

25
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:18,046
<i>by the time I loaded you
on the wagon, but you didn't.</i>

26
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:21,216
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen
more times over the next few days,

27
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,718
but you didn't.
What kept you going?

28
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,257
Hate.

29
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,428
No, there's a reason
you're still here.

30
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,397
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big
fucker and I'm tough to kill.

31
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,967
No, a reason.

32
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,625
Gods aren't done with you yet.

33
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,340
I've heard that before.

34
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,642
Man was talking about
a different god, though.

35
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:49,877
Well, maybe he was right.

36
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,579
I don't know much about the gods.

37
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:53,982
You're in the wrong line of work.

38
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,984
Oh, there's plenty
of pious sons of bitches

39
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,586
who think they know
the word of god or gods.

40
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:01,155
I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

41
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:05,660
Maybe it is the Seven.
Or maybe it's the old gods.

42
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,662
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

43
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,498
Or maybe they're all
the same fucking thing.

44
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
I don't know.

45
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,302
What matters, I believe,

46
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,405
is that there's something
greater than us.

47
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:22,343
And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

48
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:28,349
You didn't know me back in my time.

49
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:32,420
You don't know the things I've done.

50
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,157
I've heard stories.

51
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:40,228
If the gods are real...

52
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:44,565
why haven't they punished me?

53
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:48,603
They have.

54
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:05,520
Your Grace.

55
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,689
What are we reading today?

56
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,358
The Book of the Mother,
Your Holiness.

57
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
Chapter three, verse 12.

58
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:16,698
Ah, "As water rounds
the stones, smoothing--"

59
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,401
"Smoothing what was jagged,
so does a woman's love

60
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,537
calm a man's brute nature.

61
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,506
<i>A wife salves her husband's wounds,</i>

62
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,076
a mother sings
her son to sleep."

63
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:31,212
You learn quickly.

64
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:35,249
There are some who know every
verse of the sacred text,

65
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,352
but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

66
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,889
and savages who can't read at all

67
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,726
who understand the Father's wisdom.

68
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,764
For years I pretended

69
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,999
to love the poor, the afflicted.

70
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:56,504
I had pity for them,
but I never loved them.

71
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,373
They disgusted me.

72
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,709
They are hard to love.

73
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:04,946
The poor disgust us
because they are us,

74
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:07,381
shorn of our illusions.

75
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:10,985
They show us what we'd look
like without our fine clothes.

76
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,755
How'd we smell without perfume.

77
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:18,893
Can I ask you
about a personal matter?

78
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,661
Of course.

79
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:26,834
The king mentioned
that since your reunion,

80
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,137
you haven't joined him
in the marriage bed.

81
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:31,874
No.

82
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,809
You have a duty, Your Grace.

83
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:38,312
To your husband,
your king, your country,

84
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,748
to the gods themselves.

85
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,950
It's just...

86
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:47,288
the desires that once
drove me no longer do.

87
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,092
Congress does not require desire

88
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:55,463
on the woman's part, only patience.

89
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,432
The king must have an heir

90
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,169
if we are to continue our good work.

91
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,938
Forgive me.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,674
Sometimes the true path
is hard to find.

93
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,910
Hard to find

94
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:11,913
and harder still to walk upon.

95
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:14,482
But you've made great progress.

96
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,387
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

97
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,291
My grandmother?

98
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:24,792
Yes.

99
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:28,129
The Queen of Thorns
is a remarkable woman,

100
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,064
a strong woman,

101
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,899
and an unrepentant sinner.

102
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,869
<i>You must teach her the new way</i>

103
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,604
<i>as she taught you the old.</i>

104
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,707
Or I fear for her safety,

105
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,442
body and soul.

106
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,983
<i>Does it move or talk?</i>

107
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,552
I want to speak with you alone.

108
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:54,956
Septa Unella has been my
true friend and counselor.

109
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:57,725
Oh, this is madness!

110
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,634
You're not in your sanctuary
now, my dear.

111
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:10,471
All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

112
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,673
- Grandmother.
- ...until I tell them to stop.

113
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,176
If I tell them to stop.

114
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,679
- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

115
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,314
What have they done to you?

116
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,216
You marched against the High Sparrow,

117
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,218
- against the Faith.
- We marched for you.

118
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,054
The gods could have punished you
and Father, but they didn't.

119
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:29,156
- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

120
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:30,858
What mercy did they show him?

121
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,829
Loras's only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

122
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:38,032
If he does, the Faith will allow
him to return to Highgarden.

123
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,368
He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

124
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,237
- Have you lost your mind?
- ...and live his life as a penitent.

125
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,874
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

126
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:48,409
He can begin again.

127
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,144
As a mindless fanatic.

128
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,079
As a free man.

129
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,716
You will leave for Highgarden today.

130
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:59,520
There is no law that says
you must stay here.

131
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,455
I am the queen.

132
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:05,526
It is my duty to serve
my husband the king.

133
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:11,432
But you should leave, Grandmother.

134
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,534
Your place is at home.

135
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:16,037
I will never leave you.
Never.

136
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,838
You must.

137
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:22,143
Go home.

138
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:26,147
Find comfort in prayer
and good works.

139
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,319
The Mother watches over us all.

140
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,361
I'll see you soon, my dear.

141
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,302
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

142
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,582
Shall we pray?

143
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,768
<i>We said we'd
fight with you, King Crow,</i>

144
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,037
<i>when the time comes and we meant it,</i>

145
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,905
but this isn't what we agreed to.

146
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,540
<i>These aren't white walkers.</i>

147
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,476
<i>This isn't an army of the dead.</i>

148
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:31,912
This isn't our fight.

149
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,882
<i>If it weren't for
him, none of us would be here.</i>

150
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:38,252
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

151
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:41,655
And I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

152
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,958
Remember Mance's camp?

153
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,627
<i>It stretched all the way
to the horizon.</i>

154
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,763
And look at us now.

155
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,365
Look what's left of us.

156
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,968
And if we lose this, we're gone.

157
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,539
<i>Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.</i>

158
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,775
<i>Be like we were never there at all.</i>

159
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,877
We'll be the last of the free folk.

160
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,481
That's what'll happen
to you if we lose.

161
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:12,053
The Boltons, the
Karstarks, the Umbers,

162
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,854
they know you're here.

163
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:16,857
They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

164
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,593
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

165
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:22,329
<i>You're right.</i>

166
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,065
<i>This isn't your fight.</i>

167
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,700
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

168
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:28,302
I shouldn't be asking you.

169
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:30,171
It's not the deal we made.

170
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:34,141
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

171
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:37,344
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

172
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:45,486
The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

173
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,588
when no other southerners would.

174
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,358
He died for us.

175
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:55,863
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

176
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,766
<i>And if that's what we are,</i>

177
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,469
we deserve to be
the last of the free folk.

178
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,054
Snow.

179
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,665
Are you sure they'll come?

180
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:08,602
We're not clever
like you southerners.

181
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:12,106
When we say we'll do
something, we do it.

182
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,458
I heard you were
leaving King's Landing.

183
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:34,628
That is hardly your concern.

184
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,598
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

185
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,500
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

186
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:42,803
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

187
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:46,407
The High Sparrow rules
this city because of you.

188
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,844
Our two ancient houses
face collapse because of you

189
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,880
and your stupidity.

190
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,650
You're right.

191
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,686
I made a terrible mistake.

192
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:00,554
I carry it with me every single day.

193
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:02,156
Good.

194
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:05,793
I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

195
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,062
And now we must fight them together.

196
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,433
We need each other.

197
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,838
I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

198
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,741
At a certain age,
it's hard to recall.

199
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:25,446
But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

200
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,715
<i>Do you remember the way
you smirked at me</i>

201
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:31,652
<i>when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?</i>

202
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:34,521
I do.
I'll never forget it.

203
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,357
You love your granddaughter.

204
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,426
<i>I love my son.</i>

205
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,930
It's the only truth I know.

206
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,032
We must defend them.

207
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:48,402
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

208
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:52,573
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

209
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,642
If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

210
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,410
you'll find a way out of here, too.

211
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:58,112
Never.

212
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,613
I'll never leave my son.

213
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,682
What'll you do, then?

214
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:04,685
You have no support.
Not anymore.

215
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:07,855
Your brother's gone. The
High Sparrow saw to that.

216
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,891
<i>The rest of your family
have abandoned you.</i>

217
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,860
<i>The people despise you.</i>

218
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:15,429
You're surrounded by enemies,
thousands of them.

219
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:17,498
You're going to kill them
all by yourself?

220
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,567
<i>You've lost, Cersei.</i>

221
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,705
It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.

222
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:34,748
<i>Pick the pace up.</i>

223
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,317
<i>Keep going.</i>

224
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,389
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

225
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,361
Now, that is a sorry
attempt at a siege.

226
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:24,098
Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,067
Someone certainly does.

228
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:29,787
Oh, no.
Not me.

229
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:31,422
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

230
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:34,291
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

231
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,226
Aye, knights don't get paid.

232
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,930
You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.

233
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:44,101
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

234
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:49,273
I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.

235
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,408
You can be the right hand I lost.

236
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:58,048
You promised me
a lordship and a castle

237
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,117
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

238
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,720
And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always--

239
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:05,923
Don't say it.
Don't fucking say it.

240
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:27,911
Come out and
fight us, Blackfish.

241
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,847
We have Lord Edmure.

242
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:34,518
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

243
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,073
This is your last warning.

244
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,041
Yield the castle.

245
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,289
You think I won't do it, old man?

246
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:17,795
I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.

247
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:21,832
And where were you? Running and
hiding like a fucking coward.

248
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:28,472
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

249
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:41,251
Go on, then.
Cut his throat.

250
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,509
Lothar, is it?

251
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,811
Ser Jaime.

252
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,479
We didn't know you were coming.

253
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,248
'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.

254
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,184
You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

255
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:18,088
Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

256
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,090
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

257
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,259
Whoa, whoa.

258
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,794
Walder.

259
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,099
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

260
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,605
Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.

261
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,474
Now let's say I threatened to hit you

262
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:40,143
unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

263
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:42,713
- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's--

264
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,484
I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.

265
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,220
<i>Have him bathed and fed.</i>

266
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:52,890
Unless you'd like to take his place.

267
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,826
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

268
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:57,227
Do as he says.

269
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,730
The siege is now under my command.

270
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,432
The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,

271
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,569
he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.

272
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,838
<i>Have your lads start
digging perimeter trenches.</i>

273
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,439
Set pickets every hundred yards.

274
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,075
And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.

275
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,510
Those are our
siege towers--

276
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:16,079
As I said, the siege
is under my command.

277
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,749
<i>If that's not to your
liking, go home.</i>

278
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:27,057
Get word to the Blackfish.

279
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,026
I want a parley.

280
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:31,028
A parley or a fight?

281
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:34,064
He's an old man.

282
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,933
You've got one hand.

283
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,135
My money's on the old boy.

284
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,489
Lady Mormont.

285
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,359
Welcome to Bear Island.

286
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,668
I remember when
you were born, my lady.

287
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,503
<i>You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.</i>

288
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:16,340
It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

289
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,775
I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty

290
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,143
or any other kind of beauty.

291
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,412
<i>She was a great warrior, though.</i>

292
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,848
She died fighting
for your brother Robb.

293
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:31,688
I served under your uncle
at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

294
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,858
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

295
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,593
I was his steward.
In fact--

296
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,863
I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

297
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:45,035
Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

298
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:47,637
<i>before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.</i>

299
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,540
He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.

300
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,542
- It said--
- I remember what it said.

301
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,144
Bear Island knows no king

302
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,913
but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

303
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,385
Robb is gone,

304
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,020
but House Stark is not.

305
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:06,289
<i>And it needs your support
now more than ever.</i>

306
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:10,460
I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

307
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:23,540
As far as I understand, you're a Snow

308
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,442
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

309
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,611
Or is she a Lannister?

310
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,980
I've heard conflicting reports.

311
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:33,050
I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

312
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,919
But I am a Stark.
I will always be a Stark.

313
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,522
If you say so.
In any case,

314
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,491
you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.

315
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,494
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

316
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,363
<i>It is our duty to stop him.</i>

317
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:50,767
Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

318
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,005
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that--

319
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:58,942
I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.

320
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:03,580
So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

321
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:12,689
If it please, my lady,

322
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,391
I understand how you feel.

323
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,927
I don't know you, Ser...?

324
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,029
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

325
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,731
<i>You needn't ask your
maester about my house.</i>

326
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,167
It's rather new.

327
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:28,238
All right, Ser Davos
of House Seaworth.

328
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,307
How is it you understand how I feel?

329
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:35,145
You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

330
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:38,782
Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

331
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,650
<i>I never thought
I'd be in my position.</i>

332
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,888
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

333
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,057
And now I find myself
addressing the lady

334
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,326
of a great house in time of war.

335
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:53,630
But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

336
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,900
It's our war.

337
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,970
Go on, Ser Davos.

338
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:04,341
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

339
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:06,343
made that man his steward.

340
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:09,246
He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

341
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:11,348
he had the courage
to do what was right,

342
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,384
<i>even if it meant giving his life.</i>

343
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:18,421
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

344
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:22,859
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

345
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,428
It's between the living and the dead.

346
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,499
And make no mistake, my lady,

347
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,568
the dead are coming.

348
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:34,905
Is this true?

349
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:39,609
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

350
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,411
<i>I fought them at Hardhome.</i>

351
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,446
We both lost.

352
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,652
As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

353
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:52,556
And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

354
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,194
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

355
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,196
<i>But there's no hiding from this.</i>

356
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:03,300
We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

357
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:17,981
House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

358
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,386
We will not break faith today.

359
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,260
Thank you, my lady.

360
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,563
How many fighting men can we expect?

361
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,504
62.

362
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,744
- 62?
- <i>We are not a large house,</i>

363
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,179
<i>but we're a proud one.</i>

364
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,014
And every man from Bear Island

365
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,483
fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

366
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:57,153
If they're half
as ferocious as their lady,

367
00:27:57,256 --> 00:27:59,489
the Boltons are doomed.

368
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,033
Kingslayer.

369
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:19,936
Blackfish.

370
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,005
I assume you're here

371
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,507
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

372
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:27,911
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

373
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,780
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

374
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:33,717
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

375
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:36,353
Then why are you here?

376
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,188
You know why I'm here.

377
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,123
This castle belongs to House Frey.

378
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,758
You're trespassing.

379
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,627
In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or--

380
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,198
Or you'll kill Edmure?

381
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,034
My nephew's marked
for death no matter what.

382
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:52,569
Hang him and be done with it.

383
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,337
It won't stop with Edmure.

384
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,473
You'll force me to storm the castle.

385
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,375
Hundreds will die.

386
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:01,878
Hundreds of mine.
Thousands of yours.

387
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,547
If you can breach the walls.

388
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:08,651
We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

389
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,322
But if you surrender,

390
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,657
I'll spare the lives of your men.

391
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,426
On my honor.

392
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,128
Your honor?

393
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,464
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

394
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,366
The war is over, ser.

395
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:26,136
Why sacrifice living men
to a lost cause?

396
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:35,945
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

397
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,982
This is my home.

398
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:42,952
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

399
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,922
So you can either attack

400
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:48,725
or try to starve us out.

401
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,594
We have enough provisions
for two years.

402
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:57,133
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

403
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:05,341
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

404
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:07,177
Why did you come treat with me?

405
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,580
Sieges are dull.

406
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,150
And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.

407
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,786
Well, now you have.

408
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,922
Aye, now I have.

409
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,491
I'm disappointed.

410
00:31:30,836 --> 00:31:32,836
<i>The answer is no.</i>

411
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:36,072
- Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
- I've heard enough.

412
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,875
We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

413
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:40,977
The Boltons helped us do it.

414
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,912
Now you want me
to fight against them?

415
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,981
I could be skinned
for even talking to you.

416
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,350
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton--

417
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,520
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

418
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:53,490
House Mormont.

419
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,525
And?

420
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:58,027
We sent ravens
to Houses Manderly--

421
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:00,964
I don't care about ravens.

422
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,333
You're asking me to join your army.

423
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:06,769
Who is fighting in this army?

424
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:14,644
The bulk of the force
is made up of wildlings.

425
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,682
Then the rumors are true.

426
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,453
I didn't dare believe them.

427
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:30,226
I received you out of
respect for your father.

428
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,262
Now I would like you to leave.

429
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:35,665
House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home

430
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:38,401
to fight alongside wildlings.

431
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:42,171
- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

432
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,340
I would remind you that House Glover

433
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:46,442
is pledged to House Stark.

434
00:32:46,545 --> 00:32:49,445
Sworn to answer when called upon.

435
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:03,626
Yes, my family served
House Stark for centuries.

436
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:06,529
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

437
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:11,100
When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

438
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,336
and hailed him King in the North.

439
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:20,610
And where was King Robb

440
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:23,880
when the ironborn
attacked this castle?

441
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:27,617
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

442
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:31,454
and brutalized
and killed our subjects?

443
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:35,391
Taking up with a foreign whore.

444
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:39,362
Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.

445
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,569
I served House Stark once,

446
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:49,606
but House Stark is dead.

447
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,599
Why did we have to come here?

448
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:52,068
Some of us still like it.

449
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,307
Have a drink at least.

450
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,709
I don't want one.

451
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:04,614
Don't go far, love.

452
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,783
I'll find you in a bit.

453
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:15,191
Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

454
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:17,894
Doesn't interest you anymore?

455
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:23,966
I'm sorry.
I won't joke about it.

456
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:27,503
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

457
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,238
Don't you know that?

458
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,311
You think Uncle Euron's
hunting for us?

459
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:38,948
Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.

460
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,683
He'll find us.

461
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,486
It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

462
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,021
Drink.

463
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,522
I don't want any.

464
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:48,591
I don't care what you want. Drink.

465
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:53,663
Drink it all.

466
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:59,569
You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.

467
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,070
Some bad years?

468
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:04,273
But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.

469
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,642
Drink the goddamn ale.

470
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,682
Now listen to me.

471
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,117
I need you.

472
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:17,754
The real Theon Greyjoy,
not this rat shit pretender.

473
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,622
Can you find him for me?

474
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,492
Drink.

475
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:25,995
You escaped.
You hear me?

476
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,631
You got away and you're
never going back.

477
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,700
We'll get justice for you.

478
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:33,436
If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.

479
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,938
Fuck justice, then.
We'll get revenge. Drink.

480
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,912
Listen to me.

481
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:46,048
If you're so broken
that there's no coming back,

482
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:48,384
take a knife and cut your wrists.

483
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:51,888
End it.

484
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,858
But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.

485
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,361
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

486
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:01,931
We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

487
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,834
And we're gonna take back
the Iron Islands.

488
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,539
Are you with me?

489
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,809
Are you really with me?

490
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:34,263
Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

491
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,399
I'm gonna go fuck
the tits off this one.

492
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:51,781
Stannis camped here
on his way to Winterfell.

493
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,217
And that's a good thing?

494
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,053
He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

495
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:59,822
He chose this place for a reason.

496
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:02,325
Those mountains are
a natural fortification.

497
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:04,160
There's a stream
down there for the horses.

498
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:06,095
We're not staying here long.

499
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,997
Another storm could hit any day.

500
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,733
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

501
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:12,768
as much as the Boltons did.

502
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:16,839
We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.

503
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,075
2,000 wildlings,

504
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:22,078
200 Hornwoods,
143 Mazins--

505
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,347
62 Mormonts.

506
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,382
It's not what we'd hoped for.

507
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,754
But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.

508
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,125
For fuck's sake.

509
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:41,831
So he's your most
trusted advisor now?

510
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:45,134
Because he secured 62 men
from a 10-year-old?

511
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,837
Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you

512
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,106
and he served Stannis for years.

513
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,842
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

514
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:56,345
who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?

515
00:38:56,447 --> 00:39:00,116
It's not enough.
We need more men.

516
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,984
There's no time.

517
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,487
If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord--

518
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,722
We fight with the army we have.

519
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,028
Friends, this is not
worth fighting over!

520
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:15,531
<i>This'll be it, now.</i>

521
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:18,167
Right, now we don't need
to be fighting--

522
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,835
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

523
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:21,671
<i>Yeah, who the fuck are you?</i>

524
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:08,384
<i>I was a soldier once.</i>

525
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:11,454
<i>All my superiors thought I was brave.</i>

526
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,623
<i>I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.</i>

527
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:18,260
Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.

528
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:20,262
That's all I was, a coward.

529
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:24,233
We followed orders
no matter the orders.

530
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:26,869
<i>Burn that village.</i>

531
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:29,305
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

532
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,074
Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

533
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:35,878
Kill those young lads so they
won't take up arms against us.

534
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,948
I'm your murderer.

535
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,219
I remember once
a woman screaming at us,

536
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:47,790
calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.

537
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,059
But we weren't animals.

538
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:52,661
Animals are true to their nature

539
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:55,097
and we had betrayed ours.

540
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:00,536
I cut that young boy's throat myself

541
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,538
as his mother screamed

542
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,573
and my friends held her back.

543
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:09,478
That night...

544
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,816
I felt such shame.

545
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:16,819
Shame was so heavy on me,

546
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,356
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

547
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,225
All I could do was stare
into that dark sky

548
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:26,829
and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

549
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:35,237
I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

550
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,477
Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

551
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,913
All I can do with time I've got left

552
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,348
is bring a little
goodness into the world.

553
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:48,517
That's all any of us
can do, isn't it?

554
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,187
Never too late
to stop robbing people,

555
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,122
<i>to stop killing people.</i>

556
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:56,092
Start helping people.

557
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:58,694
It's never too late to come back.

558
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,512
And it's not about waiting for
the gods to answer your prayers.

559
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:19,982
It's not even about the gods.
It's about you.

560
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:23,352
Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

561
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,891
Seven save you, friends.

562
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:31,794
<i>How can we help you?</i>

563
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:36,832
What are you doing here?

564
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,802
Well, we're talking about life.

565
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:40,904
You?

566
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,771
Protecting the people.

567
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:46,442
<i>Well, we thank you
for your protection.</i>

568
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:48,777
<i>Who are you protecting us from?</i>

569
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,915
Do you have any horses?

570
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,850
No horses.

571
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,987
<i>No gold.
No steel.</i>

572
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,724
Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.

573
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,926
I'm sure it is.

574
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:05,427
You're welcome to stay for supper,

575
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,097
<i>but we have hungry mouths here.</i>

576
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,907
Stay safe.

577
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,042
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

578
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:46,936
"Seven save you,
friends."

579
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:49,505
I'm a fucking septon.
What was I supposed to say?

580
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,373
They don't believe in your Seven.

581
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:53,776
They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

582
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:56,011
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

583
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:57,880
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

584
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:59,515
Sure, you do.
You've got food,

585
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:02,184
you've got steel even
if you say you don't.

586
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:03,652
And you've got women.

587
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:06,422
What do you want to do?
Fight them?

588
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:08,290
Kill them?

589
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:09,858
It'd be you against all of them.

590
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:12,428
I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

591
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,729
You do.

592
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:16,465
I'm done with fighting.

593
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,567
Even if it's to protect yourself?

594
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:21,237
Violence is a disease.

595
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,506
You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

596
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,977
You don't cure it by dying, either.

597
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,647
You've done enough work for one day.

598
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:34,450
Come on up for some supper.

599
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:36,752
It's gonna be a cold night.

600
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:38,854
We'll need firewood.

601
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:41,390
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

602
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:43,492
Might even have some ale hidden away.

603
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,736
He's not a lying man.

604
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,005
He says the Iron Fleet's
in Slaver's Bay.

605
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,706
I'm inclined to believe him.

606
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:00,576
I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

607
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:02,611
You're Westerosi.

608
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:04,146
What do you care?

609
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,248
I want to book passage home.

610
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,418
You? Can't afford it.

611
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:18,427
Where'd you steal this from?

612
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,496
Why do you care?

613
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:22,865
We leave in two days.

614
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:24,667
You can have a hammock in steerage.

615
00:45:27,305 --> 00:45:28,637
<i>I want a cabin.</i>

616
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:30,673
And we'll leave at dawn.

617
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:33,809
See you at sunrise.

618
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,231
Sweet girl.

619
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:12,504
