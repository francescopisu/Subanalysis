00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,444
<i>It's coming from the courtyard.</i>

3
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:38,951
It's the Lord Commander!

4
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:54,000
Help me get him inside.

5
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:51,224
Thorne did this.

6
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,698
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

7
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,399
Trust?

8
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:04,871
The men in this room.

9
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,825
Does the wolf know you?

10
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,910
We need all the help we can get.

11
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,252
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

12
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:04,130
<i>I saw him in the flames</i>

13
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:06,382
fighting at Winterfell.

14
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,555
I can't speak for the flames...

15
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,275
but he's gone.

16
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,164
<i>He was our Lord Commander.</i>

17
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,082
<i>He never should have been!</i>

18
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,761
You all know why you're here.

19
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,560
Jon Snow is dead.

20
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,845
Who killed him?

21
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,815
I did.

22
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,184
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

23
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,569
and the other officers
in this castle.

24
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,355
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

25
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,411
You're right!

26
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,746
<i>We've committed treason, all of us.</i>

27
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,950
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

28
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,752
I had no love for him.

29
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,205
That was no secret.

30
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,542
But I never once disobeyed an order.

31
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:26,045
Loyalty is the foundation

32
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
on which the Night's Watch is built.

33
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,633
And the Watch means everything to me.

34
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,685
I have given my life,

35
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,889
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

36
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:43,779
Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

37
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:46,482
<i>He let the wildlings
through our gates</i>

38
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,036
as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

39
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:54,907
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

40
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:58,744
and raped and murdered.

41
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,082
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

42
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,085
I've no doubt about that.

43
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,389
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

44
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:13,676
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

45
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,929
And we made it.

46
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,943
<i>He'll have
seen we didn't come.</i>

47
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,112
Thorne will have
made it official by now.

48
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,697
Castle Black is his.

49
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,950
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

50
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,618
Jon was my friend.

51
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,922
And those fuckers butchered him.

52
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,458
Now we return the favor.

53
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:46,959
We don't have the numbers.

54
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,011
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

55
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,130
<i>I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,</i>

56
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:54,433
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

57
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,021
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

58
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,307
We all die today.

59
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:04,110
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

60
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,613
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

61
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:10,116
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

62
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,569
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

63
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,496
Bolt the door.

64
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,498
Don't let anyone in.

65
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,666
I'll be back as soon as I can.

66
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,930
<i>She was 11 the
first time I saw her.</i>

67
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,684
The kennelmaster's daughter.

68
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,106
She smelled of dog.

69
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:57,029
I wasn't much older, but everybody
was already afraid of me.

70
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,699
You certainly were.

71
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,706
Myranda wasn't, though.

72
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:11,677
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

73
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:13,629
She was fearless.

74
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,382
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

75
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,891
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

76
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,564
I wish you could be here to watch.

77
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,488
<i>Shall I have a
grave dug for her, my lord?</i>

78
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,993
<i>Or would you rather
the men build a pyre?</i>

79
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,133
Buried, burned?

80
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:52,885
This is good meat.

81
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,420
Feed it to the hounds.

82
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:59,141
Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

83
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,144
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

84
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,897
Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

85
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:06,982
- No.
- A shame.

86
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,984
I'd reward the man.

87
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:12,404
Still, a great victory.

88
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,523
Do you feel like a victor?

89
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,497
I rebelled against the crown

90
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,666
to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

91
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,285
Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

92
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,621
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

93
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,041
is the same as facing a prepared
and provisioned Lannister army?

94
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:36,545
No.

95
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,132
A reckoning will come.

96
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:41,850
We need the North to face it.

97
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,802
The entire North.

98
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:47,139
They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

99
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,893
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

100
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,195
You played your games with her.

101
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:56,815
You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

102
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:59,818
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

103
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:01,453
<i>They won't get far.</i>

104
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,539
I'm glad to hear it.

105
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,959
Without Sansa, you won't be
able to produce an heir.

106
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:10,129
And without an heir, well...

107
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,301
let's hope the maesters are right

108
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,303
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

109
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,658
We can't stop.

110
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,878
We have to cross here.

111
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,467
- I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

112
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:08,103
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

113
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,723
I've seen what his hounds
do to a person.

114
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,808
This way is better.

115
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,426
Over here.
Come on.

116
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:04,193
Sansa.

117
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,246
Sansa.

118
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:30,436
<i>Tell them to settle down!</i>

119
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,770
Stay here.
I'll lure them away.

120
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,972
No, I won't make it without you.

121
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,808
You will.

122
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,143
Go north, only north.

123
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,062
Jon is Lord Commander
at Castle Black.

124
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,814
He'll help you.

125
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:53,542
See somebody, eh?

126
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,161
- There they are!
- Get them!

127
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,167
Where is Lady Bolton?

128
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,170
- Dead.
- Liar.

129
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:08,507
<i>She broke her leg
jumping from the ramparts.</i>

130
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,676
I left her to die in the snow.

131
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,649
Got something!
Run!

132
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:21,270
<i>Hyah!</i>

133
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,114
Resist. Stay.

134
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,201
<i> Stay.</i>

135
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:40,539
I can't wait to see what parts
Ramsay cuts off you this time.

136
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,216
<i>Rider! Who is it?</i>

137
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,852
It's a bloody woman.

138
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,455
No! Please!

139
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,595
Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

140
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,348
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

141
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,684
and give my life
for yours if need be.

142
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,354
I swear it by the old
gods and the new.

143
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,166
And I vow...

144
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:26,371
that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

145
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,340
<i>and...</i>

146
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,294
Meat and mead at my table.

147
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,546
...meat and mead
at my table.

148
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,637
And I pledge to ask no service of you

149
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:44,222
that might bring you dishonor.

150
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:47,559
<i>I swear it by the old
gods and the new.</i>

151
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:50,646
Arise.

152
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:39,244
<i>Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

153
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,913
A ship from Dorne
has sailed into the harbor.

154
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,033
Myrcella.

155
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:01,026
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dead body?

156
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,029
Mother.

157
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,033
All I could think about when she died

158
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,335
was what would happen to her now.

159
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:16,958
Every day, every night,

160
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:19,377
what does Mama look like now?

161
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,015
Has she started to bloat?

162
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,053
Has her skin turned black?

163
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,224
Have her lips peeled
back from her teeth?

164
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:40,065
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

165
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:44,452
I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

166
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,739
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

167
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,541
I have to.

168
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,712
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

169
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:57,048
She's not suffering.
She's gone.

170
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:00,001
No one can hurt her anymore.

171
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,388
She was good.

172
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:07,676
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

173
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,429
I don't know where she came from.

174
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,434
She was nothing like me.

175
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,987
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

176
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,772
I know.

177
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:25,110
<i>I thought if I could
make something so good,</i>

178
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,779
so pure...

179
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,118
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

180
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,754
She was my daughter and I failed her.

181
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,340
No, I knew this would happen.

182
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,592
The witch told me years ago.

183
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:45,630
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

184
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:48,300
"And gold their shrouds."

185
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,968
Everything she said came true.

186
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,803
You couldn't have stopped it.

187
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,555
It's prophecy.
It's fate.

188
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,641
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

189
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,895
You told me yourself
when Father died.

190
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,863
You said we had to stay together.

191
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,200
You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

192
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,818
That was a prophecy, too.

193
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:09,204
I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

194
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,740
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

195
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,209
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

196
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,827
We're the only ones who matter,

197
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,046
the only ones in this world.

198
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,605
And everything they've taken from us,

199
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,750
we're going to take back and more.

200
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:27,005
We're going to take
everything there is.

201
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:37,983
"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

202
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,902
They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

203
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,988
they do not feel the flames,

204
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,991
for now they see
if not for a single sin

205
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,827
they concealed,
they were saved."

206
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:50,829
I'd like to see my brother.

207
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:53,198
- Confess.
- Please.

208
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,283
How is he?
At least tell me that.

209
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,701
Confess.

210
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,874
I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

211
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
<i>Sinners don't make demands.</i>

212
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,762
They make confessions.

213
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,518
Septa Unella.

214
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:16,471
Our other guests need you.

215
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,734
There.

216
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:34,572
Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

217
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,074
I'll speak with her.

218
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:40,879
My brother, can you
tell me how he is?

219
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:46,584
It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

220
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,754
Your husband misses you dearly.

221
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,892
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

222
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:57,145
It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

223
00:24:57,264 --> 00:25:01,733
But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

224
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:04,652
And only confession can purge sin.

225
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,439
I have nothing to confess.

226
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:12,160
So you believe you are pure?

227
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,112
Perfect?

228
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:16,581
Wholly without sin?

229
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,284
None of us are.

230
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:24,039
You have started down the path.

231
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,625
But you have many miles to go.

232
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:44,225
I always envied Oberyn.

233
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:46,027
He lived.

234
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,729
He truly lived.

235
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:49,647
Sailed around the world.

236
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,649
Fought men from every country.

237
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:54,152
Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

238
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,321
- And men.
- And men.

239
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:58,990
He experienced everything

240
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:01,993
while I sat here in Dorne

241
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,998
trying my best to keep my
people alive and well fed.

242
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,833
But that is life.

243
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,554
We each have our roles.

244
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:17,425
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

245
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,394
And I was born to rule.

246
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,262
The gods are not fools.

247
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:24,232
You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

248
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,818
And Oberyn, pfft,

249
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:28,603
he would have been a terrible ruler.

250
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:32,073
Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

251
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,492
<i>Prince Doran.</i>

252
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,339
The Princess Myrcella.

253
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,477
When was the last time
you left this palace?

254
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:11,896
You don't know your own people.

255
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:15,233
<i>Their disgust for you.</i>

256
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:19,237
Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

257
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:23,908
Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

258
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:27,712
You're not a Dornishman.

259
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,049
You're not our prince.

260
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:35,420
My son Trystane...

261
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:40,491
Your son is weak just like you.

262
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:44,662
And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

263
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,938
I told you I'm not hungry.

264
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,190
We're not here to feed you.

265
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:16,394
We're here to kill you.

266
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,197
You want her to do it or me?

267
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:22,901
We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.

268
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,737
Her or me?

269
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,326
You.

270
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,294
Good.

271
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:35,747
Smart boy.

272
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,933
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

273
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,410
We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

274
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,029
from the top
of an 800-foot pyramid.

275
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,531
We'll be fine.

276
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:13,117
We're dressed like common merchants.

277
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:17,038
You walk like a rich person.

278
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:20,091
You've spent a lot of time
studying the way rich people walk?

279
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:24,178
You walk as though the paving
stones were your personal property.

280
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:27,465
I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

281
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,600
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

282
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,304
Because you have no cock.

283
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:45,743
For your baby.

284
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,328
To eat.

285
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,038
To eat.

286
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:54,158
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

287
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,754
His Valyrian is terrible.

288
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,632
He only wants to give you money,

289
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,761
so your baby can eat.

290
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:20,518
- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
<i>- I know what mhysa means.</i>

291
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,487
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

292
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:26,107
Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

293
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,942
The Sons of the Harpy?

294
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:29,610
Very possibly.

295
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,415
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

296
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:38,453
told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

297
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,705
You can see why they're unhappy.

298
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,091
Of course,

299
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,877
it could also be the freed men.

300
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,932
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

301
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:53,394
The Lord of Light sent the
Mother of Dragons to you,

302
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,106
and those who love the
darkness chased her away.

303
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,775
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

304
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:04,128
She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

305
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,241
How will you respond?

306
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:12,163
Will you wring your hands, while you
wait for the Mother of Dragons to return?

307
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:16,042
Or will you take up her flames yourselves?

308
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,087
Will you fight for your own salvation,

309
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,339
now that Queen Daenerys
is not here to fight for you?

310
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:23,782
It's a problem.

311
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,453
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

312
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:32,674
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

313
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:35,960
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

314
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:39,047
We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

315
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,564
The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

316
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,516
in the fighting pits very carefully,

317
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,269
which means they take
orders from someone.

318
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,488
And have you started
looking for that someone?

319
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:52,358
My little birds
have already taken wing.

320
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:56,945
Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

321
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:35,818
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

322
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,441
Goat?

323
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,143
Ram.

324
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,895
You think our friend got him?

325
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,316
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

326
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,570
We're on the right path, then.

327
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,790
Perhaps she's
tired of being queen.

328
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,959
I don't think she likes it very much.

329
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,245
She's too smart to like it.

330
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,163
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

331
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,249
somewhere far away from men like us.

332
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,168
I've been all over the world.

333
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,170
There's no escaping men like us.

334
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,973
There's no escaping her, eh?

335
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,260
You keep coming back.
Why?

336
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,844
You know why.

337
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,932
Isn't it frustrating

338
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:43,435
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

339
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:44,987
Of course it is.

340
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,656
You're a romantic.
I admire that.

341
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,742
Sometimes I look at you and I think,

342
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,161
"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

343
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,946
If you grow old.

344
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,281
If I grow old.

345
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,583
I hope I do.

346
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,418
I want to see what
the world looks like

347
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,120
when she's done conquering it.

348
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:03,255
So do I.

349
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:25,728
Huh, an army?

350
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,229
Not an army.

351
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,064
A horde.

352
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,924
Dothraki?

353
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,033
They have her.

354
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,880
Maybe she saw a ghost.

355
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,842
My friend's mother saw a ghost
and her hair turned white.

356
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,553
Pink people are afraid of the sun.

357
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,596
It burns their skin.

358
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,433
This one stands too long in the sun
and her hair goes white.

359
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,937
You think she's got white pussy hair too?

360
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,231
You ever been with a girl
with white pussy hair?

361
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:33,442
Only when I was fucking your grandma.

362
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,614
I'll ask Khal Moro for a night with you.

363
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,950
What do you think?

364
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,579
Pretty eyes, but she's an idiot.

365
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,583
She doesn't have to be smart
to get fucked in the ass.

366
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:54,130
I like to talk when I'm finished.
Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.

367
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,293
No.

368
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,057
For you, my Khal.

369
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,726
The white-haired girl we found in the hills.

370
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,023
Look at those lips, blood of my blood.

371
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,734
Blue-eyed women are witches.

372
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,235
It is known.

373
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:03,574
Cut off her head,
before she casts a spell on you.

374
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,869
Even if I was blind,

375
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,413
I'd hear my wives say,

376
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,291
"Cut off her head"

377
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,169
and I'd know this woman is beautiful.

378
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,755
I'm glad I'm not blind.

379
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,050
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time,

380
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,802
what is better than that?

381
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,887
Killing another Khal?

382
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,766
Yes, killing another Khal.

383
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:32,311
Conquering a city
and taking her people as slaves,

384
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,981
and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.

385
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,857
Breaking a wild horse,

386
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,318
forcing it to submit to your will.

387
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,488
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time

388
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,908
is among the five best things in life.

389
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,080
Do not touch me.

390
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,340
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,

391
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:05,970
the First of Her Name, the Unburnt,

392
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,471
Queen of Meereen,

393
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:10,307
Queen of the Andals
and the Rhoynar and the First Men,

394
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,226
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

395
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,311
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

396
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,959
You are nobody, the millionth of your name,

397
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,753
Queen of Nothing,

398
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,130
slave of Khal Moro.

399
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,007
Tonight I will lie with you,

400
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:45,634
and if the Great Stallion is kind,

401
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:47,928
you will give me a son.

402
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,972
Do you understand?

403
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,559
I will not lie with you.

404
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:58,856
And I will bear no children,
for you, or anyone else.

405
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:02,735
Not until the sun rises in the west,
and sets in the east.

406
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,654
I told you she was a witch.

407
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,990
Cut off her head.

408
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:12,495
I like her. She has spirit.

409
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:17,500
I was wife to Khal Drogo,
son of Khal Bharbo.

410
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,881
Khal Drogo is dead.

411
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,257
I know.

412
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,344
I burnt his body.

413
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,557
Forgive me. I did not know.

414
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,560
It is forbidden to lie with a Khal's widow.

415
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,187
No one will touch you.

416
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,359
You have my word.

417
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,201
If you will escort me back to Meereen,

418
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:56,539
I will see that your khalasar is given
a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.

419
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,375
When a Khal dies,

420
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,711
there is only one place for his khaleesi.

421
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:08,843
Vaes Dothrak.
The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

422
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:12,680
To live out her days with
the widows of dead khals.

423
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,225
It is known.

424
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,093
<i>But there has to be a
price to pay for everything.</i>

425
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,797
<i>I know, but have you
tried telling him that?</i>

426
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,690
Thank you.

427
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,326
Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

428
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,111
<i>- Probably had it coming.</i>
<i>- Maybe so,</i>

429
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:14,830
<i>but I'm not risking it.</i>

430
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,531
<i>- Just can't do it.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

431
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,034
<i>Honesty as well. He gets it.</i>

432
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,624
<i>Are you listening, blind girl?</i>

433
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,961
Do you hear them talking?

434
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,764
<i>Do any of them talk to you?</i>

435
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,266
<i>No.</i>

436
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,219
So sad.

437
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,394
Stand and fight, blind girl.

438
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,614
I can't see.

439
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,817
That's your problem, not mine.

440
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,513
See you tomorrow.

441
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,452
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

442
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,704
We are both anointed knights.

443
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,375
Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.

444
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,627
<i>I will grant
amnesty to all brothers</i>

445
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,079
<i>who throw down their arms
before nightfall.</i>

446
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,800
<i>And you, Ser Davos, I will
allow you to travel south</i>

447
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,753
a free man with a fresh horse.

448
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,473
<i>And some mutton.</i>

449
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,141
<i>I'd like some mutton.</i>

450
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,062
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.

451
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:47,766
I'll need some food if I'm gonna
make it south without starving.

452
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:53,772
We'll give you food.

453
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:57,075
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

454
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,612
<i>Or you can leave her here with
us, whichever you choose.</i>

455
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:05,533
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

456
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:09,004
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

457
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:13,258
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and
come back to you with an answer.

458
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:32,560
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

459
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,814
In my learned opinion,
we open that door--

460
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,365
And they'll slaughter us all.

461
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,784
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

462
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,371
- Aye, but we don't need to make it
easy for them. - <i>Edd is our only chance.</i>

463
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,825
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

464
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,328
There's always the Red Woman.

465
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:53,020
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

466
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:56,772
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.

467
