2
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,573
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

3
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:41,679
Perhaps we should take shelter.

4
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,409
The city's on the rise?

5
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,951
Meereen is strong.

6
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,918
Commerce has returned to the markets.

7
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,455
The people are behind you.

8
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,359
Well, not all the people, of course.

9
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,529
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

10
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:02,866
<i>But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.</i>

11
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:07,303
The Masters cannot
let Meereen succeed.

12
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,606
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

13
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,877
a city without Masters...

14
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,579
...it proves that
no one needs a Master.

15
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,484
Good.

16
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,386
Shall we begin?

17
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,755
Do we have a plan?

18
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,824
I will crucify the Masters.

19
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,693
I will set their fleets afire,

20
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,628
kill every last one
of their soldiers,

21
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,797
and return their cities to the dirt.

22
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
That is my plan.

23
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,103
You don't approve?

24
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,538
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

25
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,308
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

26
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,744
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

27
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:54,083
Probably not.

28
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:56,518
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

29
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,222
<i>He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,</i>

30
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:02,857
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

31
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,859
all the major thoroughfares.

32
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,130
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

33
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,565
The loyal ones and the traitors.

34
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,001
Every man, woman, and child.

35
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,502
That's why Jaime killed him.

36
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:16,904
This is entirely different.

37
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:19,040
You're talking about
destroying cities.

38
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,142
It's not entirely different.

39
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:28,482
I'd like to suggest
an alternate approach.

40
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,497
Once before, I offered you peace.

41
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,967
If you had not been so arrogant,

42
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,904
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

43
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:57,010
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

44
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:59,379
like the beggar queen you are.

45
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,515
<i>We are here to
discuss terms of surrender,</i>

46
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,984
not to trade insults.

47
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:07,019
The terms are simple.

48
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:10,623
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

49
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,124
<i>and the city of Meereen.</i>

50
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,727
<i>The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz</i>

51
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,729
<i>will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.</i>

52
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:20,866
<i>The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain</i>

53
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,335
to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

54
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:27,206
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

55
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,277
We obviously didn't
communicate clearly.

56
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,145
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

57
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:40,051
I imagine it's difficult

58
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,654
adjusting to the new reality.

59
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,293
Your reign is over.

60
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,764
My reign has just begun.

61
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,886
Dracarys.

62
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,226
You men have a choice:

63
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:26,234
fight and die for masters
who would never fight and die for you,

64
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,987
or go home to your families.

65
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,716
Thank you for the armada.

66
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,585
<i>Our queen does love ships.</i>

67
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:45,756
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

68
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,958
You violated that pact.

69
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,726
You declared war upon us.

70
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,096
<i>Though our queen does have
a forgiving nature,</i>

71
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:55,399
this cannot be forgiven.

72
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:58,368
Our queen insists
that one of you must die

73
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,771
<i>as punishment for your crimes.</i>

74
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,442
It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

75
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,243
other people dying?

76
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,214
Him.
He should die.

77
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:13,584
<i>- Yes, him.</i>
<i>- He's not one of us.</i>

78
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,218
<i>He's an outsider, a lowborn.</i>

79
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,253
<i>He does not speak for us.</i>

80
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,392
Please.

81
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:25,595
Please.

82
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:46,616
Tell your people what happened here.

83
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:51,553
Tell them you live
by the grace of Her Majesty.

84
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,755
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

85
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:58,260
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

86
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,462
remind them what happened

87
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:04,132
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

88
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,002
You don't have to be here.

89
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,071
Yes, I do.

90
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,763
My beloved wife.

91
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,201
I've missed you terribly.

92
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,874
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

93
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:24,677
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

94
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,013
surrender your army and proclaim
me the true Lord of Winterfell

95
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,781
and Warden of the North.

96
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,850
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

97
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:35,854
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

98
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,560
Come, bastard,

99
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,462
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

100
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,765
<i>and you don't have Winterfell.</i>

101
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,501
<i>Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?</i>

102
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,271
There's no need for a battle.

103
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,241
Get off your horse and kneel.

104
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,944
I'm a man of mercy.

105
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,751
You're right.

106
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,886
There's no need for a battle.

107
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,057
Thousands of men don't need to die.

108
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,761
Only one of us.

109
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,198
Let's end this the old way.

110
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,300
You against me.

111
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,649
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

112
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,917
The way people in the
North talk about you,

113
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,186
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

114
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,757
Maybe you are that good.

115
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,992
Maybe not.

116
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,627
<i>I don't know if I'd beat you.</i>

117
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,898
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

118
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,066
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

119
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:00,569
You have, what, half that?

120
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,071
Not even?

121
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,107
Aye, you have the numbers.

122
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,142
Will your men want to fight for you

123
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:10,045
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

124
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,723
He's good.
Very good.

125
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,860
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

126
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:27,162
because you're too proud
to surrender?

127
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,131
How do we know you have him?

128
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,324
<i>Now, if you want
to save--</i>

129
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,893
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

130
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,898
Sleep well.

131
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,075
She's a fine woman, your sister.

132
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,178
<i>I look forward to having
her back in my bed.</i>

133
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:24,184
And you're all
fine-looking men.

134
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:26,453
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

135
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,188
I haven't fed them for seven days.

136
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,589
They're ravenous.

137
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:32,725
I wonder which parts
they'll try first.

138
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:35,228
<i>Your eyes?</i>

139
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,696
Your balls?

140
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,401
We'll find out soon enough.

141
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:45,738
In the morning, then, bastard.

142
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:04,990
<i>If he was smart,
he'd stay inside</i>

143
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:06,858
<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

144
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,929
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

145
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,864
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

146
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,666
they'll stop fearing him.

147
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:17,436
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

148
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:20,138
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

149
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,841
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

150
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:25,243
It's not his men that worry me.

151
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,678
It's his horses.

152
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,947
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

153
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,183
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

154
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:34,518
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

155
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,821
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

156
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,156
in a double envelopment.

157
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:44,028
A pincer move.

158
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:51,535
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

159
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,437
Good.

160
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:58,676
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

161
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,680
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

162
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:08,618
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

163
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,189
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

164
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,993
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

165
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,728
No.

166
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,630
But I wanted to make him angry.

167
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,668
I want him coming at us full tilt.

168
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,506
We should all get some sleep.

169
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:33,342
<i>Rest, Jon Snow. We
need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

170
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,255
So you've met the enemy,

171
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:49,758
drawn up your battle plans.

172
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,761
Aye, for what they're worth.

173
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:56,732
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

174
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,666
you and your trusted advisors,

175
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,335
<i>and you sit around making your plans</i>

176
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:03,304
<i>on how to defeat
a man you don't know.</i>

177
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,906
<i>I lived with him.</i>

178
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,641
I know the way his mind works.

179
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:09,810
I know how he likes to hurt people.

180
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:14,081
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

181
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,285
You're right.

182
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:21,022
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

183
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:23,390
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

184
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,293
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

185
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:29,030
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

186
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:31,965
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

187
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:35,869
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

188
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,705
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

189
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,275
You don't know him.

190
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,578
All right, tell me.

191
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,447
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

192
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,150
We'll never get him back.

193
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:55,655
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

194
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,490
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

195
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:00,660
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

196
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:03,696
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

197
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:07,300
which means he won't live long.

198
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:09,768
We can't give up on our brother.

199
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,938
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

200
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,109
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

201
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,277
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

202
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,780
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

203
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:23,082
Aye, that's good advice.

204
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,583
You think that's obvious?

205
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,018
Well, it is a bit obvious.

206
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,385
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

207
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,154
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

208
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:31,590
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

209
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:33,959
When will we have a larger force?

210
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,128
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

211
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,462
The Blackfish can't help us.

212
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,531
We're lucky to have this many men.

213
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:43,034
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

214
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:51,376
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

215
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:59,684
If Ramsay wins,

216
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,719
I'm not going back there alive.

217
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,387
Do you understand me?

218
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,893
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

219
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,898
I'll protect you, I promise.

220
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,735
No one can protect me.

221
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,638
No one can protect anyone.

222
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,457
<i>You think there's hope?</i>

223
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,893
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

224
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,362
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

225
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:48,364
so, yes, there's hope.

226
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:54,170
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

227
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:57,073
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

228
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,675
It was Stannis himself.

229
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,410
I loved the man.

230
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:03,946
He lifted me up
and made me something.

231
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:07,183
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

232
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,785
- You saw these demons?
- What?

233
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:13,255
No, it's a manner of speaking.

234
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,126
Not actual demons.

235
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,561
Oh.

236
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,631
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

237
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,866
and I loved the man he burned.

238
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,968
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

239
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,572
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

240
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,041
I believed in him.

241
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:37,112
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

242
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,380
But I was wrong just like you.

243
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:44,452
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

244
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:48,589
Jon Snow's not a king.

245
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,126
No, he's not.

246
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:59,333
<i>I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.</i>

247
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,901
You want some?

248
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,404
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

249
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,472
stronger than any of that grape water

250
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,741
you southern twats like sucking on.

251
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,676
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

252
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:12,379
but I better keep a clear head.

253
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:14,782
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

254
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,583
So what do you do all night?

255
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,852
I walk.

256
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,720
Think and walk.

257
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:22,922
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

258
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,124
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

259
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,128
Happy shitting.

260
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,475
My lady.

261
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:50,382
You weren't at the war council.

262
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:53,820
I'm not a soldier.

263
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:57,323
Any advice?

264
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,658
Don't lose.

265
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,533
If I do, if I fall...

266
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,670
don't bring me back.

267
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,706
I'll have to try.

268
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,908
I'm ordering you
not to bring me back.

269
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,643
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

270
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:21,046
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

271
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,815
I serve the Lord of Light.

272
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:26,151
I do what he commands.

273
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,585
How do you know what he commands?

274
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:32,423
I interpret his signs

275
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,592
as well as I can.

276
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,597
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

277
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,266
how did I bring you back?

278
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:44,902
I have no power.

279
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:48,272
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

280
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,009
Why?

281
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,178
I don't know.

282
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:03,387
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

283
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,390
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

284
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:13,630
What kind of god would do
something like that?

285
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,700
The one we've got.

286
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:10,710
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

287
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:17,049
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

288
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:21,453
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

289
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:25,391
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

290
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:28,828
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

291
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,662
"someone to look up to."

292
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,166
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

293
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:37,536
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

294
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:40,906
And how have things been
going for you since then?

295
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:43,808
Not so well, I gather.

296
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,411
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

297
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,746
if things had been going well.

298
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:49,447
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

299
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:52,383
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

300
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:53,718
And he paid for them.

301
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,787
Doesn't seem like it.

302
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,722
He's still alive.

303
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,791
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

304
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:02,060
growing up at Winterfell.

305
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:05,329
Never quite knowing who you were.

306
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:08,966
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

307
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:11,035
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

308
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,770
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

309
00:27:12,772 --> 00:27:15,073
In return, I expect
you want me to support

310
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,608
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

311
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,610
Not my claim.
Hers.

312
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:21,712
And what's wrong with you?

313
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm not fit to rule.

314
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:24,982
We can agree upon that at least.

315
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:27,651
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

316
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:29,252
No more than Westeros.

317
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:34,458
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

318
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,094
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

319
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,663
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

320
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:45,300
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

321
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:47,436
You and I have that in common.

322
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,305
We do.

323
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:52,642
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

324
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:55,644
Will their ships be enough?

325
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,780
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

326
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,915
Barely.

327
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,718
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

328
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,221
There are and Euron is building more.

329
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,956
He's going to offer them to you.

330
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,458
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

331
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,127
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

332
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,328
He also wants
to give you--

333
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,066
His big cock, I think he said.

334
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:21,402
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

335
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:23,271
<i>You won't get one without the other.</i>

336
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,907
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

337
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,210
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

338
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:33,814
<i>He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.</i>

339
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:36,484
<i>He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.</i>

340
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:38,219
The Seven Kingdoms.

341
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:39,520
All of them.

342
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:41,289
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

343
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,658
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

344
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,260
We ask you to give them back.

345
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:48,628
And that's all?

346
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,264
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

347
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,233
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

348
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:54,902
Reasonable.

349
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:59,872
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

350
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:02,008
She's not demanding, she's asking.

351
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,777
The others are free to ask as well.

352
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:12,085
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

353
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,654
They left the world
worse than they found it.

354
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:16,322
<i>We're not going to do that.</i>

355
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:19,358
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

356
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:24,964
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

357
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:28,367
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

358
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,938
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

359
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,841
That's our way of life.

360
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,376
No more.

361
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,652
No more.

362
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:33,905
Do you like games, little man?

363
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,974
Let's play a game.

364
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,379
Run to your brother.

365
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:43,314
The sooner you make it to him,

366
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:45,716
the sooner you get to see him again.

367
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:49,954
That's it.

368
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:52,190
That's the game.

369
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,192
Easy.

370
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:56,194
Ready?

371
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:57,461
Go.

372
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:04,502
No, you have to run, remember?

373
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,670
Those are the rules.

374
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:21,551
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,011
Hyah! Hyah!

376
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:06,686
Don't.

377
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,798
Prepare to charge.

378
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:22,268
Prepare to charge.

379
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:26,672
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

380
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:28,874
<i>Draw!</i>

381
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,343
<i>Loose!</i>

382
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:34,180
Hyah! Hyah!

383
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:40,319
Go! Go!
Follow your commander!

384
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:47,259
Run and fight!

385
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:15,286
Hyah!

386
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:18,056
<i>Nock!</i>

387
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:20,558
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

388
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,226
<i>- Loose!</i>
<i>- Loose!</i>

389
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,003
Now.

390
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:37,340
<i>Cavalry, charge!</i>

391
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:33,128
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

392
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,630
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

393
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,367
- Draw!
- Draw!

394
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,170
- Draw!
<i>- Draw!</i>

395
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:47,475
We'll just kill our own men.
Stand down.

396
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:50,244
- Loose!
- Loose!

397
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,352
Get word--

398
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:53,472
<i>No!</i>

399
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,720
Loose!

400
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:26,371
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

401
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:36,013
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

402
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:08,378
We may as well be
taking shits back here.

403
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,581
Follow!

404
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,223
It's time, go.

405
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:24,794
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

406
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:27,630
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

407
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,264
Show me!

408
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:00,162
Hey!

409
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,454
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

410
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:36,255
With me, lads!
Break their line!

411
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,255
Help me!

412
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,618
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

413
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,354
<i>Infantry, advance.</i>

414
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:52,128
<i>Both sides!</i>

415
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,063
<i>Fall back!</i>

416
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:57,166
<i>Fall back!</i>

417
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:19,555
Fuck this, come on!

418
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:31,566
We're going home!

419
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:50,049
<i>Open the gate!</i>

420
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:57,256
<i>Archers to the wall.</i>

421
00:49:59,227 --> 00:50:01,493
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

422
00:50:02,863 --> 00:50:04,763
We have Winterfell.

423
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:07,332
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

424
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:09,234
<i> Archers!</i>

425
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:10,936
To the wall!

426
00:51:45,096 --> 00:51:47,997
You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

427
00:51:55,706 --> 00:51:58,306
I've reconsidered.

428
00:51:58,308 --> 00:52:01,777
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

429
00:54:01,662 --> 00:54:04,395
We're going to bury
my brother in the crypt

430
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:06,497
next to my father.

431
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:13,905
Jon.

432
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,679
Where is he?

433
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,641
Ah.

434
00:54:51,643 --> 00:54:53,210
Sansa.

435
00:54:56,682 --> 00:54:58,881
Hello, Sansa.

436
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:08,891
Is this where I'll be staying now?

437
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:19,301
No.

438
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:26,875
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

439
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,314
<i>That's all right.</i>

440
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:34,149
You can't kill me.

441
00:55:35,753 --> 00:55:37,919
I'm part of you now.

442
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,991
Your words will disappear.

443
00:55:45,662 --> 00:55:48,529
Your house will disappear.

444
00:55:48,531 --> 00:55:51,733
<i>Your name will disappear.</i>

445
00:55:53,703 --> 00:55:56,304
<i>All memory of you will disappear.</i>

446
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:26,133
My hounds will never harm me.

447
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:28,635
You haven't fed them in seven days.

448
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:30,136
You said it yourself.

449
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:36,075
They're loyal beasts.

450
00:56:36,077 --> 00:56:37,977
<i>They were.</i>

451
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:39,879
Now they're starving.

452
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:05,871
Sit.

453
00:57:05,873 --> 00:57:07,406
Down.

454
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:10,008
Down!

455
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:13,379
Down! Down!

456
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:15,314
Down!

457
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:09,175
