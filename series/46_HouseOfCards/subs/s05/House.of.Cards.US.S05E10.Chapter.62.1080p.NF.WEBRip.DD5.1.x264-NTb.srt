1
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,571
The dead sleep with their eyes open,
my grandfather would say.

2
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,366
They're watching you from the past...

3
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,992
Jackie Sharp.

4
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,619
Romero wasted no time.

5
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,870
What good are you?

6
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,997
You Democrats are full of surprises.

7
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,920
Her lawyers won't let us
get anywhere near her.

8
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,043
Because they're negotiating
her testimony.

9
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,586
How the hell did we get here?

10
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,964
Romero was privy to information.
Someone from within the party.

11
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,652
He's threatening
to go after her for whipping votes

12
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,887
in exchange for campaign funds
from a Mr. Remy Danton,

13
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,014
who, shockingly, she was sleeping with.

14
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,099
Well, she's not testifying
because of an affair.

15
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,203
She's testifying
'cause she doesn't want to go to jail.

16
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,354
Which is the only reason anyone testifies.

17
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,708
Doug, keep at the rest of the Democrats
on that committee.

18
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,359
Make sure they stay in line.

19
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,404
I'll keep working my side of the aisle,
but... uh, Romero.

20
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,613
He's a prick.

21
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,241
Mmm-hmm,
prick who still wants whip.

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,034
Terry Womack has been very loyal.

23
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,579
Yeah, well, there's loyal,
and then there's good.

24
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,915
What has Womack brought you?

25
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,335
Did he kill
the Declaration of War Committee?

26
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,396
Did he deliver Missouri
for you in November?

27
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,629
That's enough.

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,798
Let's give it to him.

29
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,717
Look, sometimes you
have to make hard choices.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,427
I'll talk to Terry.

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,513
Romero's gonna have to find
a place for him to land, and...

32
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,515
where that is matters to me.

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,933
That'll be all for now.

34
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,353
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,822
- Put Doyle on this.

36
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,950
We already vetted Romero.

37
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,077
No, I mean on Usher.

38
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,039
The body is remarkably well-preserved,

39
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,751
except for the extremities,
which frostbite took care of.

40
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,210
But dental is intact.

41
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,005
Our counterparts in Antarctica
are cooperating fully,

42
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,608
and the body will be in our possession
within the next 12 hours.

43
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,343
I'll have it in transit after customs.

44
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,346
We'd like the body to get lost in transit.

45
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,680
Ma'am?

46
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,266
It needs to get lost.

47
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,183
Yes.

48
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,146
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Director Green.

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,648
Uh, keep in touch.

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,865
- I thought you'd gone to bed.
- Can't yet.

51
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,538
- Who's that?
- No one we know.

52
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,834
Tom, I said it's no one we know.

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,720
You ever hear about the 5,000-year-old man
they found frozen in the Italian Alps?

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,097
No.

55
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,311
His skull was caved in... from the back.

56
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,021
He probably never saw it coming.

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,694
Beaten and left for dead.

58
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,866
Left for dead is an ancient concept.

59
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,370
You know, when you freeze to death...

60
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,624
the last thing you feel is extreme heat.

61
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,167
That hurts.

62
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,211
Sorry.

63
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,675
I saw Francis out there.

64
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,595
He seems on edge.

65
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,848
Can you blame him?

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,560
Better?

67
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,626
Shoplifting is the worst of it.

68
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,338
A couple of recent street buys
that led to court-mandated rehab.

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:44,343
That's where she lives, where she works,
where she scores...

70
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,889
But all I see here is a woman in her 20s,
trying to get to 30.

71
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,643
- She's a concern.
- I don't get it.

72
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,646
She was in touch with Gavin Orsay
before he left for Venezuela.

73
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,230
- Doug...
- Nathan!

74
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,734
There's a bite to your tone
that we might need to discuss.

75
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,656
She's a loose end and an addict.

76
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,618
That's a bad combination.

77
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,248
It's a clean slate.

78
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,460
Donald Blythe's taste was
a bit too dark for me,

79
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,003
so I stripped it all back.

80
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,591
I have chosen one painting so far
that's on its way, though.

81
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,512
Thad Peterson's body is taken care of.

82
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,431
His name is John Doe.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,434
I'd recognize him anywhere.

84
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,063
This would've been very embarrassing
to some interests

85
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,565
that are important to this country.

86
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,192
And I wouldn't want the family
to see him this way.

87
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,862
What's the news
from the Jordanian Embassy?

88
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:51,285
Aidan Macallan still won't reveal
what he did or didn't tell Petrov.

89
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,788
Well, the president wants him
brought back from his asylum

90
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,247
to the United States immediately.

91
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,091
I think we should give it
a little more time.

92
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,546
You know, I wonder if it was
such a good idea to bring you in on this.

93
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,716
- You promised...
- I know. I know. Ahmadi...

94
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,053
We've got Special Forces
on the ground, tracking.

95
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:12,890
Russia's presence in Syria is making this
more difficult than I once thought.

96
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,352
I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.

97
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,441
It never ceases to astonish me
how talented men are at making a mess.

98
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,500
Uh, it's not gonna serve you
to go after your own party.

99
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,292
You never stop.

100
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,171
Jackie Sharp will never testify.

101
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,798
Well, then she'll go to jail.

102
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,761
You can't prove it, Alex.
You can't prove the quid pro quo.

103
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,012
She seems to think I can.

104
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,658
If you play it a little differently,
you have a chance to get what you want.

105
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,226
- We're offering you whip.

106
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,395
- I don't want it anymore.
- What?

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,689
Jesus Christ.

108
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,693
Ways and Means, then.

109
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,945
The keynote at the next convention.

110
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,029
What I want is for Francis Underwood
to go to jail.

111
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,240
How is that gonna help you?

112
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,536
Really? How's it gonna help you?

113
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,750
There's another way to go at it.

114
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,754
Wanna make a name for yourself?

115
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,524
You wanna make the president's life
a living hell?

116
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,090
Draw it out.

117
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,677
Keep the committee going
but at a slow burn.

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,595
Aren't you working for him?

119
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,389
Members of the administration,
you bring 'em in one at a time.

120
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,810
You could ride this for a couple of years
and secure your place.

121
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,770
While you keep the president in check.

122
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,398
Don't end it before it's begun
by calling Jackie Sharp.

123
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,881
You know I see good things for you.

124
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,360
Let me plan out your next eight years.

125
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,238
Hmm. The candidates you worked with...

126
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:58,287
how many of them have waited and waited
and lost their moment? Hmm?

127
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,916
Yeah, that's right.

128
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,501
I'm reading the moment, and this is mine.

129
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,504
Let me out on Third Street.

130
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,424
- I'll drop you at Rayburn.
- No, I always walk the final 50 yards.

131
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,695
Never know when you might
get a chance to press some flesh.

132
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,720
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,097
Hi, I'm Alex Romero.

134
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,975
I represent the Seventh District
of Arizona.

135
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,436
I want to know what keeps you up at night,
so I can work all day to address it.

136
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,396
The future belongs to all of us.

137
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,566
I hope I can count on your support.

138
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,903
What do you think, Mark? Huh?

139
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,780
I mean, you're the expert.

140
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,617
Right here.

141
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,495
Romero said no,
and the usual offers don't interest him.

142
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,873
Oh, he's interested.
He just hates himself for it.

143
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,500
I am making headway
with the Republicans on the committee.

144
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,754
They all have pasts,
most of them have witnesses.

145
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,131
One way or another,
Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.

146
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,384
So why are you having so much trouble
with this one young congressman?

147
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,636
He's tenacious.

148
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,805
He reminds me of you.

149
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,557
Well, I don't see that at all.
We'll talk later.

150
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,603
I could reach out to Danton...

151
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,730
We expose him, he'll expose us.

152
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:09,483
- Well, then what do you suggest?
- That I go on being presidential.

153
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,402
That's the only way
that I can deal with this.

154
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,946
It's my first 100 days, for God's sake.

155
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,073
Francis...

156
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,243
we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.

157
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,704
There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world.

158
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,414
Not for all we've done.

159
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,581
Then what?

160
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,796
Destroy Romero, for one.
Can we at least take care of that?

161
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,756
And then who?
The rest of the Democratic Party?

162
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,216
I know what I'm doing, Claire.
I've been president before.

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,509
So have I.

164
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,262
Get me Terry Womack.

165
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,141
Your job as vice president is to advise.

166
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,852
- My job is to make the decisions.

167
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,899
Terry, yes, I'm just checking in.

168
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,905
Mmm-hmm. Well, I want you
to know that we support you.

169
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,991
That bastard asked for whip,
but that's never gonna happen.

170
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,155
Not while I'm in this office.
I wanted to assure you.

171
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,579
I've always tried to help where I can.

172
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,082
And you couldn't help
at Health and Human Services?

173
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,711
The agency does some amazing work.

174
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,090
Well, you were quoted as, uh,
calling your position a dream job.

175
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,134
It's possible to have more than one dream.

176
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,637
I can have my assistant give you a tour.

177
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,099
Uh, show you some of the video from Haiti

178
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,935
and some of the work
that we've been doing there

179
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,436
over the last several months.

180
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,438
I will be sure to include

181
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,166
your organization
in the piece I'm writing.

182
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,026
- I believe in the work you're doing here.
- Thank you.

183
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,196
What was it like, uh,
working with the Underwood administration?

184
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,075
They were fine.
Let's leave it at that.

185
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,513
You know, I've met with, uh,
many wonderful organizations so far.

186
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,752
- The Virginia Children's Defense Fund.
- They do some great work.

187
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,087
Mmm, uh, The Talbot League?

188
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,421
Another terrific group.

189
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,051
The Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

190
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,223
I don't know anything about them.

191
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,852
Organ transplantation awareness.

192
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,854
Oh, is that right?

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
Hmm.

194
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,027
Hi.

195
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,906
I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,784
It's rude, but I was famished.

197
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,411
Thank you for meeting me.
Let me get you a menu.

198
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,289
Uh, no, thank you.
I have a lunch right after this.

199
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,583
Good. You should
always have one on the books.

200
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,510
- Miss Davis?
- You're worried about Aidan.

201
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,596
Do you call him anything for short?

202
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,599
Why would you ask me that?

203
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,437
I don't know if the president,
or vice president,

204
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,272
has informed you, but Mac is fine.

205
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,443
It's what he knows is the problem,
and who he may have told it to.

206
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,529
He wants to stay alive.

207
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,491
Yes.

208
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,036
But those are the ones
you have to watch out for.

209
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,541
Last I spoke to Aidan
was minutes before he got in a cab.

210
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,377
I don't know what he has
or what he's done.

211
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,088
I only do what I'm told.

212
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
I'm in the Hoover Building.

213
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,095
It's the ugliest building in...
in the city.

214
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,888
I close my eyes as I walk in.

215
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,517
Stop by any time.
Especially if you're in the mood to talk.

216
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,312
We could use someone
who says as little as you do.

217
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,132
Lisa!

218
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,892
- I've been looking for her.
- I have no idea where she is.

219
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,021
- Let me help you with that.
- No. No, I'm okay.

220
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,608
- I'm happy to carry it for you.
- You're scaring me.

221
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,487
I'm just worried about her. That's all.

222
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,739
I'm clean.

223
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,951
Good.

224
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,662
At least I'm trying to get clean.
Please leave me alone.

225
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,164
Hey...

226
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,839
Just...

227
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,551
If you hear from Rachel, just, uh...

228
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,804
tell her I've taken care of everything.

229
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,891
She can come home
and everything will be fine.

230
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,317
I miss her, you know?

231
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,900
You going to answer that?

233
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,652
So, was I right?

234
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,404
Your phone is ringing.

235
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,448
Uh, oh...

236
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,724
You know, you can just hang it up
by pressing the button on the side.

237
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,334
- You don't have to decline...
- I'm a creature of habit.

238
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,838
So, yeah, you were right.

239
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,342
This phone has only been used once
to call one number, once.

240
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,095
I mean, I used
the manufacturer's serial number

241
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,097
and tracked down
where it's distributed to.

242
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,849
It was a, um... a shop in Dupont Circle.

243
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,185
And who did it call?

244
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,395
Comes up unknown.

245
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,105
But the prefix...

246
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,899
And, look, you're gonna have to talk
to the police or the FBI.

247
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,027
- I just can't keep...
- Don't worry. It's on me.

248
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,447
The prefix on the call,
it looks like a government number to me.

249
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,452
Hello.

250
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,790
He followed you? When?

251
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,000
- I've got to...
- Yeah.

252
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,380
Okay. Okay, if you feel safe
where you are, stay there.

253
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,673
I'm coming to you.

254
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,094
Thanks.

255
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,389
So what couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

256
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,641
Jackie Sharp.

257
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,602
What about her?

258
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,355
You really don't know?

259
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,067
I thought this was coming
out of the White House.

260
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,489
The story's about to break that she
traded legislation for campaign funds.

261
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,615
The source?

262
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,743
So, unconfirmed.

263
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,537
It's going to be on Drudge
within the hour.

264
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,250
You really don't have anything to say?

265
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,170
If it's true, it's just sad
to see the unexpected fall

266
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,856
of a once rising star
in the Democratic Party.

267
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,006
Stop it.

268
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,468
Sharp would've been a get
for the committee.

269
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,141
If you're still willing to appear,
we're still willing to talk.

270
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,729
See ya.

271
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,073
This is not how we do things
in this administration.

272
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,034
You wanted her not to testify.

273
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,036
And there's no way
Romero can force her to now.

274
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:47,626
You've put my press secretary and
his staff in a very difficult situation.

275
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,379
It was a leak,
and it didn't come from you.

276
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,399
I really felt this was the way
to get ahead of it.

277
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,483
This is getting ahead of it?

278
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,635
I guarantee you her lawyers tell her
to plead the Fifth now, across the board.

279
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,387
Most importantly, where it concerns you.

280
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,972
But all of this happened
while I was negotiating with Petrov.

281
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,849
Oh, to the public,
you were the First Lady,

282
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,726
sitting vigil by your husband's bed.

283
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,479
So, actually, all of this happened
under Donald Blythe's watch.

284
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,670
I'm sorry if you think I overstepped.

285
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,027
I was trying to protect you.

286
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,995
He did the right thing.

287
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,497
Oh, I don't mind what he did.

288
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,833
I mind the way he did it.

289
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,503
- LeAnn...
- Madam Vice President.

290
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,464
I'm sorry my schedule is so full.

291
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,276
No, I completely understand,
with everything that you're dealing with.

292
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
I'm sorry for being so insistent,

293
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,905
but I thought you should know
that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.

294
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,972
Came after you?

295
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,683
She wanted me to work for her.
I didn't know if you knew.

296
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,892
In what capacity?

297
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,104
That, I'm not clear on, but it...

298
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,898
She wanted information
about Aidan Macallan.

299
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,025
I hope you know I would never say a word.

300
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,321
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

301
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,742
Ma'am, I was hoping
we could discuss my future.

302
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,078
Oh, LeAnn, I would love
to discuss your future, but not yet.

303
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,251
If you would like, ma'am,
I can help with Aidan.

304
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,460
Anything that's required.

305
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,504
That's good to know.

306
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,568
Did you think LeAnn Harvey
wouldn't tell me?

307
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,195
I never assume what people
will do or won't do.

308
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,115
- I thought we were working well together.
- We are.

309
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:47,454
Well, going around me to get information
will only create discord between us.

310
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,831
I wouldn't want that, Claire.

311
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,793
- Miss Davis.
- Mr. President.

312
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,085
I'm sorry I'm late.

313
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,129
The vice president has told me
that your contacts

314
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:58,757
have once again lost track of Ahmadi.

315
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,259
Yes, as I explained,

316
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,512
Syria is like a different country
one day to the next.

317
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,764
Yes, well, you can thank
Viktor Petrov for that.

318
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,516
Oh, I do.

319
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,186
Ma'am?

320
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,229
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, Jane.

321
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,399
The schedule is crazy these days.

322
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,775
Oh, of course.

323
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,196
Really? The State Department,
the Pentagon,

324
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,906
we can't get close to Ahmadi?

325
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:24,658
I just want peace.

326
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,243
Yes, there's nothing that makes
profits like peace.

327
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,497
And nothing makes peace like profits.

328
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,293
Mr. President, may I be blunt?

329
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,129
Well, I would never accuse you
of dullness, Miss Davis.

330
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,178
There's going to be a gas attack
happening in the city of Homs.

331
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,766
If you were to, let us say,
draw a line in the sand...

332
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,103
and if this tragic attack
were to happen...

333
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:59,610
the US government would have to send in
an additional 30,000 or so soldiers.

334
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:05,156
To protect the oil lines,
to keep Petrov from getting into Damascus.

335
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,660
And, of course, to protect the people.

336
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,833
That's venturing close to occupation
with those kind of numbers.

337
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:19,087
All I'm saying is
maybe the Declaration of War Committee

338
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,715
could finally debate
what they were mandated to.

339
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,634
A war.

340
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,100
Do you know Mark Usher?

341
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,815
Yes, we worked together.

342
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,652
He was handling a congressman.

343
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:43,404
Mark.

344
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,657
Has anyone offered you anything?

345
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,283
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

346
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:00,796
Have you ever worked with Jane Davis?

347
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,050
Davis is the stepfather's name.

348
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,719
A one-term senator.

349
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,600
Uh, anyway, yeah, she was interested
in a client I had, at some point.

350
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,227
A candidate for Congress.

351
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,148
Poor guy. The minute Usher realized
he wasn't formidable enough,

352
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,192
he just dumped him. Let him go.

353
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,277
But that's Mark.

354
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,698
He has an eye for talent.

355
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,867
Likes to keep you close
while he keeps himself remote.

356
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:34,580
But he disagreed
with some of her positions,

357
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,872
the money went away.

358
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,418
Listen, don't let Jane fool you.

359
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,549
She can seem a bit... haphazard...

360
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,300
But once he's done with you...

361
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,180
it's as if a switch gets turned off.

362
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,515
But she is merciless.

363
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,019
Single-minded as a single mind can be.

364
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,319
Mmm.

365
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,620
Mmm.

366
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:19,290
What? Forgot to eat today.

367
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,752
What have you got for me?

368
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,882
- I don't know.
- Don't do "I don't know."

369
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,677
Saw Meredith Lee.

370
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:36,391
I mentioned the Moretti Fund,
organ transplants, uh...

371
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,019
She got a little tense,
but... I don't know.

372
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,207
Why didn't you tell me you were fired?

373
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,941
- Oh, that was you?
- Who talked to your girlfriend? Yeah.

374
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,152
How long?

375
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,238
What's the difference? I'm tapped.

376
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,536
What are we doing here?
I don't like eating in my car.

377
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,082
I think Laura Moretti's husband
was jumped on the donor list.

378
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,128
- Where the hell did you get that?
- My gut.

379
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,172
I can lay it out for you.

380
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,550
Yeah, you say something like that,
you better.

381
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,512
Sarin gas. Mostly against civilians
in suburban areas of Homs.

382
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,307
- We're dealing with animals here.
- It's horrifying.

383
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,185
Now, you know I've always shown
restraint in the past, but...

384
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:24,522
I'm going to be making
an executive order for military action.

385
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,651
Air strikes followed by ground troops.

386
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,570
You'll need to present to the UN.

387
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,074
- Where is this intelligence coming from?
- Well, it's all there in the briefing.

388
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,202
But if we know this is going to happen,

389
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,956
well, then why aren't we stopping it
before it does?

390
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,504
Francis held on
to your resignation letter.

391
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,300
And he wants to tear it up.

392
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:04,145
I know how difficult
these past few months have been for you.

393
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,356
We've really asked a lot.

394
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,566
Once we're on the other side
of this military action,

395
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,362
you have our blessing
to leave the administration if you choose.

396
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,741
But, of course,
we'd prefer if you stay on.

397
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,326
Hope that goes without saying.

398
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:27,669
Using weapons of mass destruction
against civilians is a war crime.

399
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,214
I appreciate the opportunity
to see this through to the end.

400
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:33,466
We were hoping you would say that.

401
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:34,718
Thank you, Cathy.

402
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

403
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,184
Are you worried about her?

404
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:48,189
We need to start thinking about the people
we surround ourselves with.

405
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,359
Which has made me think of Tom...

406
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:57,198
who doesn't really have a reason
to be here anymore, does he?

407
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,744
Not an official one, no,

408
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,872
but I thought maybe we
could bring him on as a consultant.

409
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,052
Well, of course,
that's entirely up to you.

410
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,139
There's just only so much time
and energy in a single day,

411
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,725
and I think we need
to constantly be asking ourselves,

412
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,895
"Am I spending it as wisely as I can?"

413
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,785
- Thank you.
- Jane, I'm so sorry

414
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,429
to pull you away from your party.
- No, no, no.

415
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,956
- When I heard your voice on the phone...
- I just... I just...

416
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,042
- I don't know what to do.
- Did something happen?

417
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:53,046
The Underwoods are planning air strikes
and a troop surge in Homs.

418
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,259
- How awful.
- Do you know anything about this?

419
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,140
Petrov is making
the whole region a disaster.

420
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,477
No one who ever got tangled up
in the Middle East came out ahead.

421
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,896
Let Petrov own it.

422
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,946
There's something terrible
that is going to happen...

423
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,447
that we can prevent.

424
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,615
I see.

425
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,119
I'm scheduled to present
some kind of red line at the UN.

426
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,747
- But we can still pull back.
- How can I help?

427
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,751
Talk to the president,
the vice president.

428
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,087
I will.

429
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,467
They're terrible, terrible people,
aren't they?

430
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,806
Jane...

431
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,393
be very careful with them.

432
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:51,687
Of course.

433
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,026
That's from an old friend.

434
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,113
Are we still friends?

435
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,908
Of course.

436
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,014
He says the liver the president received

437
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,517
was supposed to go to a man
named Anthony Moretti.

438
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,227
And he says that Doug forced

439
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,438
then Secretary
of Health and Human Services

440
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,241
to put the president
at the top of the list,

441
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,983
which resulted in Moretti's death.

442
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,530
Oh, and Doug also has become involved
with the man's widow.

443
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,199
That's a nice touch.

444
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,493
And does... does he have proof?

445
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,330
About the relationship?
It's easy to prove that.

446
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,350
But the list, he knows that
Meredith Lee is hiding something.

447
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,919
And he's ready to go back
and talk to her about it.

448
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:57,963
Do you trust him?

449
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,216
I don't know why he'd make any of this up.

450
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,343
Hey, I'm outside.

451
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,683
Did you have a good time?

452
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,438
I never do at those things anymore.

453
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,607
Necessary evils.

454
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,236
It's not like the old days,
when you used to meet surprising people.

455
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,241
Uh... did people get less surprising
or are we less easily surprised?

456
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,828
Well, exactly.

457
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,538
- This is me.
- She asked me about you.

458
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,335
- I figured. What'd you say?
- That you're...

459
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,673
formidable, etcetera.

460
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:48,429
Yeah, I told him the same about you,
etcetera.

461
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,183
He could be a great president.

462
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,312
But does he want to be?

463
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,648
And what is great?

464
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,610
And then there's her.

465
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:04,737
What about her?

466
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,573
What about her?

467
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,209
Because if Bob or Terry
were the ranking member,

468
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,544
I'd be talking to them.

469
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,214
I want Romero's clerk stripped.

470
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,467
Yeah, whatever budget he's got
for his seat on that committee.

471
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,721
No, no, I'm asking
for the sake of the party.

472
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,474
Look, we survived Jackie Sharp,
but it's not gonna end there.

473
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,561
The truth is I'm being punished

474
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,855
for fighting for the issues
that our base cares most about.

475
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,859
Yes, and thank you.

476
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,739
Doyle says there's almost nothing
on Usher.

477
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,993
He likes to gamble, usually wins.

478
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,829
But here's the thing...
Doyle spoke with Marshall,

479
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,291
who we know did not have a happy exit
from the Conway campaign.

480
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,502
Now, he said that before Usher
joined our administration,

481
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,339
he was grooming Romero
for a presidential run.

482
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,386
Sir, I believe he's playing both sides
of whatever this committee is after.

483
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:14,724
I'm not a Democrat, Jeffrey.

484
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,019
I'm still a Republican,
just happen to work for the White House.

485
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,106
All I'm saying is
let's rein Alex in while we still can.

486
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,584
'Cause after he rips through
his own party,

487
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,248
he'll come after ours,
wouldn't you think?

488
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,696
Yeah, and Jeff, you're the chair...
No... What? No, listen.

489
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,823
Wait. Wait! Wait.

490
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,535
And you owe me, and we both know it,

491
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,871
and that's not the kind of thing
I like to say out loud.

492
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
What is?

493
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,501
When did that happen?

494
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,796
Confirmed?

495
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,596
Yeah?

496
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,765
Yes, well...

497
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,203
just because Walker's
gonna take the stand,

498
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,312
doesn't mean he'll say anything.
Right?

499
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:03,982
Hmm.

500
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,452
What was that word
you said to me this morning?

501
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,164
The one no one uses anymore?

502
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,082
Crepuscular.

503
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,251
Right.

504
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,176
Some of my favorite animals
are crepuscular.

505
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,804
Yes.

506
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:36,722
What?

507
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,808
When?

508
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:41,894
Jesus! God damn it!

509
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:50,945
Claire!

510
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,199
- Claire!
- I'm in the kitchen.

511
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,618
Walker's gonna testify.

512
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,704
- When?
- Early as next week.

513
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,808
He's gonna say the same thing
he said to Hammerschmidt.

514
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,143
There's not gonna be any new damage.

515
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,127
- We don't know that for sure.
- Let's get Usher.

516
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,171
You bet I'm gonna talk
to him in the morning.

517
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,297
Where are you going?

518
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,133
To get some goddamn space in this house!

519
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,736
I can take care of Walker.
We'll make him an offer.

520
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,072
A place back on the stage,

521
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,133
chancellor of some
well-endowed university. He'll take it.

522
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,369
He just might. But first,
I want to know what you have on Romero.

523
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,287
- I don't have a thing.

524
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,956
- Please.
- Doug, let's not be rude.

525
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,875
I find that impossible to believe.

526
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,127
If I did, you would know it.

527
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,878
You and I have been at this a long time.

528
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,756
You wouldn't even consider
a candidate without vetting him first.

529
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,007
I thought Alex had a future.

530
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,051
Yeah, a run for the presidency
as I understand it.

531
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,428
He's clean and crisp
as a starched white shirt.

532
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,864
You're gonna have to make
a decision, Mark.

533
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,806
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?

534
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,310
I have already reached out
to members of my own party.

535
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,896
I've used my political capital
to help you.

536
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,415
But you're still not answering
my question.

537
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,774
I think I have.

538
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:13,528
And I don't need to convince you
or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.

539
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,206
It's an honor to meet you.

540
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,585
Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up
with you momentarily.

541
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,882
I'm going to keep this brief.

542
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,596
If what you're saying is true...

543
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,016
Doug Stamper saved my husband's life.

544
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,185
He did.

545
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:48,146
And he also cost someone else his.

546
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,819
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man
that wants many things.

547
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,197
But you have made a mistake.

548
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:02,660
There's only one thing, professionally,
that I've always wanted.

549
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,789
- It's to work in the White House.
- Hmm.

550
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:08,291
Seth will see you out.

551
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,505
Sorry for the interruption.

552
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,468
You were saying...

553
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,098
Cathy was always a very good person.

554
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,059
At her core, she has a core.

555
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,228
Bless her.

556
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:33,191
This whole Homs initiative might be
too difficult for her.

557
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,490
You know... you're very hard to read.

558
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:43,243
Which makes sense.

559
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,788
For the last several years,
you've been a familiar face.

560
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,626
Must get exhausting.

561
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,087
Must be hardly any people
you can even share a laugh with.

562
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,431
You should figure out
how to take full advantage of me.

563
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,893
I can help you get what you want.

564
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,272
If you tell me what it is.

565
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,189
I enjoy helping others.

566
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,942
I think you know what I want.

567
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,193
Yes...

568
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,739
But do you want it now or in four years?

569
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,708
I want the whole world
to see Ahmadi's capture...

570
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,920
on every news outlet and every screen.

571
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,715
For the good of the party,
I'd prefer Mr. Walker not testify.

572
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,177
I'm considering taking myself
off the Declaration of War Committee.

573
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,431
- Alex, you don't have to do that.
- And you can do what you will with it.

574
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,310
But that's conditional
on the president doing the right thing.

575
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,813
Uh-huh. And what is that?

576
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,064
Resigning.

577
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,358
Again, I'm only thinking of the party.

578
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,240
Yeah...

579
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,078
Who the fuck do you think you are?

580
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,914
- Oh, don't use that language with me...
- Shut the fuck up.

581
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,460
You have no idea, none,
about what you're doing.

582
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,104
- I'd like you to leave my office.
- Now you listen carefully to me.

583
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,464
- I said...
- Shut up, Alex!

584
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,633
Here's a headline for you.

585
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,135
"Alex Romero colluded with Governor Conway

586
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,473
to use the Declaration of War Committee
to help him win an election."

587
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,434
- No.
- Please, you know you did.

588
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,687
- See how easy that is?
- Get out!

589
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:40,192
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing.
I just left Walker.

590
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,445
He's gonna plead the Fifth.
You'll look like a fool.

591
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,116
You want to be out front?
No one has a problem with that.

592
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,496
They want you there,
because you'll be the first to fall.

593
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,501
"For the good of the party."

594
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,842
Sleep tight, Congressman.

595
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,137
- Who knows about Will?
- No one, not yet.

596
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,389
What else?

597
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,684
Why I'm still protecting you
at this point...

598
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,103
I don't even understand myself.

599
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,027
Walker's gonna plead the Fifth.

600
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,779
And Romero won't rock the boat.

601
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,697
Thank you, Mark, I appreciate that.

602
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,074
I would suggest
you schedule a press conference

603
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,618
for right after the hearing.

604
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,702
All right.

605
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,136
Tell me the worst thing you've ever done.

606
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,474
It's hard to pick.

607
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

608
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,903
Pretended to love someone when I didn't.

609
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:09,740
In a way, that was the worst.

610
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,499
Did the person know?

611
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,251
Mmm-hmm.

612
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,422
She pretended not to know...

613
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,425
but she knew.

614
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,219
It was awful for her.

615
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,265
But I paid for that mistake, too.

616
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,770
Those types of things, they take a toll.

617
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:46,611
It's strange how some choices mean nothing
and others govern the rest of your life.

618
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,406
I've done some terrible things.

619
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,036
You don't have to tell me.

620
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,666
Francis killed Zoe Barnes.

621
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,127
Claire.

622
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,629
Francis killed Peter.

623
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,838
Stop.

624
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,590
And so many more are gonna die.

625
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,716
Stop.

626
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,149
You don't scare me.

627
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,902
I should.

628
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,001
Aidan.

629
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,003
Shh! Not anymore.

630
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,421
How did you get here?

631
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,007
A door opened, I walked out.

632
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,425
That doesn't sound right.

633
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,344
I got a visa and a flight tonight.
I just...

634
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,406
I just wanted to see you one last time.

635
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,266
Wait. Who's getting you out?

636
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,768
That doesn't matter.

637
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,939
- What did you say?
- Honestly, nothing.

638
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,899
We have to talk to the Underwoods.

639
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,443
- Nah, I don't think so.
- This does not make sense.

640
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,158
Well, you always liked
to drive a nice car.

641
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,997
Aidan, come with me.
I'll fix this.

642
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,000
You come with me.
I've a way for you to get out.

643
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,676
Well, all right, then.

644
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,884
Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me
until the morning.

645
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,190
Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?

646
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:49,274
Really?

647
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,445
Wait.

648
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,163
- Here, take this.
- No.

649
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,000
Come on. At least until
you get on the flight, all right?

650
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,922
I'm out.

651
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,831
Can't sleep?

652
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,920
It's freezing out here.
You should have a coat on.

653
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,087
I like it.

654
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,718
Don't meet with Walker.

655
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,845
I think it's a bad idea.

656
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,809
It'll remind him
of his best course of action.

657
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,521
You're wrong.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

658
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,858
Usher has it under control.

659
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,744
You always do what you want.

660
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,749
Tom doesn't want to leave.

661
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,294
Tom doesn't get to choose.

662
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,089
It's cold. You should go in.

663
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,977
If you could get me Doug Stamper's
addresses for the last three years...

664
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,812
Uh...

665
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,738
And do you know what happened
to the photo strip of Rachel and Lisa?

666
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:00,655
It's gone.

667
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,534
We need to lay out
our positions ourselves.

668
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,037
I'm already on my way to New York.

669
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,165
I don't want you to say or do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

670
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,127
I won't contradict the administration.
That's not my wish.

671
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,212
We need to draw a line in the sand.

672
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:19,174
Yes, of course.
Should I get on my flight?

673
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,719
I think it might be best
if you turn around and come back.

674
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,179
Whatever you think.

675
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,849
We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.

676
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,060
Then we'll regroup and make sure
we're on the same page.

677
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,564
Okay. We need to head back.

678
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,829
"Beware entangling alliances,"
Mr. President.

679
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,990
You know, that quote is often
attributed to Washington,

680
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,084
but it was actually Jefferson who said it.

681
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:00,299
Anyway, I wanted to catch you before,
uh, Mark and your lawyer got here.

682
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,591
Mr. President.

683
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:04,845
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

684
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,849
Well, the truth is,
one can get used to almost anything.

685
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,103
Well, at any rate, congratulations.

686
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,188
Oh?

687
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,441
You're about to become the chancellor
of one of our finest universities.

688
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,693
It's a high price we pay
for respectability.

689
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,280
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello.

690
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,408
And to thank you for all you're doing.

691
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,871
In not too long, you're going to become
one of those ex-presidents

692
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:36,210
whose work will make everyone...
forget the past.

693
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:40,672
I was once the President
of the United States.

694
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:42,299
Yes, you were.

695
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,552
You stole the presidency, Frank.

696
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,055
Now, Garrett...

697
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,641
This is ancient history,
but by modern political standards,

698
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,602
my election was a landslide.

699
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,396
I was gonna change this country.

700
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,692
But then... uh, things happen.

701
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:02,194
People lie...

702
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,654
You lie to keep up.

703
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:09,034
The things that you've been
lauded for all your life,

704
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,037
those are suddenly fatal flaws.

705
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,790
People who've been with you
through thick and thin,

706
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,419
who you thought would never fail you,
they fail you.

707
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:24,008
You make strange alliances
with unsavory people.

708
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,053
And it all becomes clear way too late.

709
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,975
And no one else truly understands.

710
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,728
Except someone who's been in the office...

711
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:43,193
You can't expect the office to do
anything more than what you bring to it.

712
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,361
Hmm.

713
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,823
- I'm doing this for the party.
- I know.

714
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,325
And it's admirable.

715
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,126
How's Tricia?

716
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,005
Well, it's taken time, but we are good.

717
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,589
The kids are doing well.

718
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,342
Well, this is just the beginning.

719
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,930
You and I are gonna be working
a lot more together from now on.

720
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,097
Is that so?

721
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,699
Doug.

722
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:36,038
Tom, it's a busy morning.
I don't have any quotes right now.

723
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,664
When you have a moment,

724
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,709
I'd like to sit down and ask you
some questions about Lisa Williams.

725
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,022
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

726
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,673
Let me know when you're free, Doug.

727
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,425
If you'd like a statement,

728
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,678
Seth Grayson's office will be
issuing a press release shortly.

729
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,264
You live near Dupont Circle, don't you?

730
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,144
I will go on the record and say yes, I do.

731
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,253
President Walker,

732
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,756
it's been established in Heather Dunbar's
special prosecutor's report

733
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,965
that we have reason to...

734
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,885
Congressman, as I mentioned to the chair

735
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,221
and the other distinguished members
of the committee,

736
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,932
I am advising my client
to plead the Fifth at this time

737
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,768
for all questions regarding his tenure

738
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,271
as President
of the United States of America.

739
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,986
I must say, uh, that as a fellow Democrat,
this is highly irregular.

740
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,948
Yes, Congressman, yes.

741
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,510
But in light of ongoing investigations...

742
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,078
Actually, I will answer
the congressman's questions.

743
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,335
Please, ask your question.

744
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,714
Under your administration,

745
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,359
millions of dollars were
illegally laundered

746
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,261
from Chinese businessmen
to affect American elections.

747
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,055
Is this true?

748
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,557
Yes. That's true.

749
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,935
And can you tell us what, if any,

750
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,937
was then Vice President
Francis Underwood's

751
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,522
involvement in this scheme?

752
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:30,026
Well, it appeared to me,
he was one of its chief architects.

753
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,159
And, uh, what exactly
do you mean by that, sir?

754
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,411
It was his idea.

755
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,666
Mark, I think you
need to be elsewhere right now.

756
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:46,793
Are we gonna bury our heads
in the sand with this?

757
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,089
No, you're going to leave,

758
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,092
and the vice president and I
are going to decide what to do.

759
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,801
Walker reneged. We had a deal.

760
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,636
We will let you know if you are needed.

761
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,763
- Sir...
- That was not a request.

762
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:06,020
Why did you have to go talk to him?

763
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,734
There has to be a way out, Francis.

764
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,614
Does there? Is there?

765
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,825
Or is this my presidency?

766
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,953
Forever with a target on my back.

767
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,623
Haunted and hunted.

768
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:40,847
LeAnn, if you're hearing this,
it means that I'm dead.
