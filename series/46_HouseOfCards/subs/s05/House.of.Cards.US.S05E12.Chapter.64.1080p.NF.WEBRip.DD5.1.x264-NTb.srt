1
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,383
I really wish I could have
changed your mind, Cathy.

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,926
- I just...
- Because, you know...

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,262
you know, this is just not good for you.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,098
The negotiations with the committee
are just too far down the road.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,867
Well, you agreed to see me
because you're smart.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,019
Because doubt is what
you should be having.

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,770
Look, Cathy, I respect you.

8
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:23,398
We wouldn't have lasted as long together
if I didn't.

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
- My husband's waiting for me.
- But you're gonna be made to look a fool.

10
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,278
There's no need to insult me, Francis.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,198
Witness after witness is gonna rebut
whatever you have to say.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,116
My testimony is what it is.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,993
It'll all be resolved
in the court of public opinion.

14
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,330
Yes, but who is the public
going to believe?

15
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,084
You or explosive residue
on a terrorist's computer?

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,878
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem
petty and vengeful.

17
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,340
And then where is that gonna leave you?
What prospects?

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,549
It's too late.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,095
- You need to take a fall.
- Excuse me?

20
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,947
Look, the committee is just gonna
have to wait.

21
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,931
In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway,

22
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,992
and you're gonna be
on the wrong side of this thing.

23
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,936
- Well, we'll see.
- Yes, we will.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,855
After you.

25
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,859
But I meant what I said, Cathy.

26
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,741
Cathy?

27
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,784
Cathy?

28
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,164
Help! Help! The secretary has fallen!

29
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,227
You're a lucky bastard.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,480
Oh, not until the end of the night.
Or should I say, the morning.

31
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,065
Catherine Durant fell? How?

32
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:15,612
- Well, people fall. That's what they do.
- Yes, they fall when they need to.

33
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,948
Your new friend
is still gonna get impeached.

34
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,659
Well, I hope I can still count

35
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,537
on the good senator's support
when the time comes.

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,082
You're a good card player, Mark.

37
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,894
You never talk shop at the table.
It's always when you're cashing out.

38
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,545
Well, my mother raised me well.

39
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,758
The numbers are getting harder and harder
for the senator.

40
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,388
- Why is that?
- The money and the calls coming in.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,282
One number goes down,
and the other one goes up.

42
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,975
The senator's feeling the heat,
from where?

43
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,953
Why don't you come in later.
We can talk about it then.

44
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,687
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

45
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,607
Danny... I'm counting on his vote.

46
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,167
- Well, you can count it out.
- No. No...

47
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,278
And half of the Democrats as well.

48
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,339
Forget about censure,
the House hasn't even voted yet

49
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,031
on articles of impeachment.

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,921
You're not the only one
working the Senate.

51
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,203
- Someone wants Francis out.
- And I'm asking you who.

52
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,292
You've been around a long time.
Nobody tells you how to vote.

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,656
They just tell you what happens
if you don't go their way.

54
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,423
Oil's at $50 a barrel.

55
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,174
Nobody's happy with that.

56
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,581
We were hoping
to bring you live coverage

57
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,375
of the judiciary hearing today.

58
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,086
But given the postponement due to
Secretary Durant's unexpected absence,

59
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,256
we'll be switching to the Armed Services
Committee meeting instead,

60
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,139
- Ma'am?
- where several military officials...

61
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,135
...are citing the increased threat
of ICO...

62
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,553
Today's schedule.

63
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,641
And I thought you might wanna see this.
It's a note from Tom Yates.

64
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,860
Oh, and reminder, we have to get back
to the Soldier Recovery Project.

65
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,558
Peace.

66
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,726
That's our goal.

67
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,104
And through peace,
we must find a different way forward.

68
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,442
Colonel Ismat is the leader
of the Democratic faction,

69
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,445
dedicated to freeing the Syrian people.

70
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,864
And since Secretary Durant
is temporarily sidelined,

71
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,034
I'm stepping in today
because the American government

72
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,663
supports any concrete steps
toward stability.

73
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,916
If it is determined
that chemical or biological weapons

74
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:01,713
have been used in the Syrian conflict,
then from this moment forward,

75
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,007
the United States will be morally
obligated to intervene.

76
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,846
So, the Syrian president
should consider himself on notice.

77
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,693
Mr. President, given the potential outcome

78
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,851
that the House will affirm
articles of impeachment,

79
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,937
is this the right time to wade
into a Middle Eastern conflict?

80
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,607
Well, the question's off subject,
but I'll answer it.

81
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,235
First of all, the vote is never gonna
get to the Senate.

82
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,572
It's a senseless partisan circus.

83
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,033
My focus is to remain doing my job,

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,454
which is to ensure prosperity
for the American people,

85
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
and to try to achieve...

86
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,958
I'm sorry, how did you say it again?
Peace?

87
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,293
- Salam.
- Salam...

88
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,964
That's what we're trying to broker here.
Salam.

89
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,760
So let's give the president time
to meet with Colonel Ismat.

90
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,083
I'll take follow-up questions
in the press briefing room.

91
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,807
Maybe I'm being too literal,
but that's the sea at night.

92
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,146
- Do you like it?
- I prefer the reds.

93
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:04,233
I... I saw a show of his
at the Tate Modern.

94
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,530
I have trouble separating
the man from the art, though.

95
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,699
He was, uh, depressive,
as I'm sure you know.

96
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,828
You can see him fighting his demons.

97
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,749
So Mr. Nasser has arrived?

98
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,127
Uh, here and waiting for my call
at the Four Seasons.

99
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,296
Well, I just...
I don't think it's a good idea

100
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,092
for anyone in our administration
to be meeting with a member of ICO.

101
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,388
- He's not a member.
- He went to school with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

102
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,059
He's a lawyer.
He represents people, organizations.

103
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,270
- One organization, to be exact.
- And he's meeting with me.

104
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,355
Where is all this hesitation
coming from?

105
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,694
I'm sorry.
I just have a splitting headache.

106
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,364
Gelsemium.

107
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,369
For migraines. I get them all the time.
It comes out of China.

108
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,832
But don't worry, it's herbal.

109
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,670
You have to be careful of the dosing,
though. Just two drops.

110
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,796
Hmm.

111
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,133
You know, it's pure feeling for me.

112
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,595
Light versus dark.

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,263
And that line where they meet.

114
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,977
The president had no idea.

115
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,020
You were close to Mr. Macallan?

116
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,023
Yes, but that doesn't mean
that I knew what he was up to.

117
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,818
But then how do you know
the president wasn't involved?

118
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,780
I was the last person to see Aidan.
He confessed to me.

119
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,618
He secretly used the NSA, FISA,
to manipulate the electorate.

120
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,871
We're meeting with counsel
to perfect the rest of the testimony.

121
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,289
As long as no one has anything
that contradicts you.

122
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,041
No one does.

123
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,378
- Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?
- It does. Thank you.

124
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,981
Well, I know Claire is delighted
to have you back in her office.

125
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,484
Will you let me know as soon
as the vice president's meeting is done?

126
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,760
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,060
I hate having her back. She's a liar.

128
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,272
You think Macallan gave her something
for insurance?

129
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,483
She won't admit it.
But, yeah, I think he did.

130
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,795
Let's get her in front of that committee
when they're up.

131
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,529
Then she'll have to make a choice.

132
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,407
Green is hesitant to testify.

133
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,744
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd think he was the leak.

134
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,347
He has far more information
than anyone should be comfortable with.

135
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,791
Also, Senator Richardson
hasn't called me back.

136
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,711
Colonel,
my apologies for the interruption.

137
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:35,176
And I want to assure you
that your concerns are my concerns.

138
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,179
The Ahmadi brothers...

139
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:42,684
their idea of radical Islam
is unsustainable.

140
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,146
Nasser represents members of ICO
who are tired of death.

141
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,901
They essentially control numerous
oil fields and several refineries.

142
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,904
Nasser already met
with the president of Syria.

143
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,075
And Petrov's minister of foreign affairs.
He's looking for a deal.

144
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,579
They wanna be a corporation trading
on the Dow before the decade is over.

145
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,581
They wanna be a part of OPEC.

146
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:09,961
So where does that leave Colonel Ismat
and the Syrian people?

147
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,880
Alive... once we're on the ground.

148
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,842
Yes, but Russia was invited in.
We need cause.

149
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:21,305
The Syrian president has gassed civilians.
He will again. I can guarantee it.

150
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:26,060
Colonel Ismat will make sure of it.
He'll instigate an attack from the regime.

151
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,484
We put troops on the ground,
leave ICO resources alone...

152
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,528
and Nasser will make sure they cooperate.

153
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,699
What is it?

154
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,912
Are you afraid he's gonna be impeached?

155
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,874
'Cause there's a good chance
that he will be.

156
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,087
Is that why you wanna wait?
'Cause... I can make it all wait.

157
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:58,050
Ms. Davis and I had
a very productive talk.

158
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:03,597
I let her know that our involvement
is contingent on the delivery of Ahmadi.

159
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,518
Yes, but the window is closing for me
to be able to act on this.

160
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,645
Judiciary's not gonna wait.

161
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,689
For this to be effective,
it has to be now or never.

162
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,026
I'll have her reach out to Mr. Nasser.

163
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,945
And, uh, what about the other matter?

164
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,531
- You mean LeAnn?
- Mmm-hmm.

165
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,242
Ms. Davis will speak to her
later this afternoon.

166
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,621
You heard the president.

167
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,968
Uh,
I'm still at the White House.

168
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:44,078
- Once we get into Syria...
- Sir, my name is Sean Jeffries.

169
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,740
- I work with...
- Yes, I know who you are.

170
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,682
Sean...

171
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,517
I know what Tom Hammerschmidt
is working on.

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,996
Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment,
I can arrange one...

173
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,231
Sir, if I could.
Just a moment of your time.

174
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,985
It's confidential.

175
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,581
Oh, if you don't mind,
we'd like this room for a moment.

176
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,632
You have 30 seconds.
But before you start,

177
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,385
am I mistaken,
or is Mr. Grayson your superior?

178
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,179
Yes, I'm sorry, but...

179
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,639
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir,

180
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,976
are somehow involved
with the death of Zoe Barnes.

181
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,537
And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone
that was given to Ms. Barnes.

182
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,481
It called only one number,
and that number was yours.

183
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,650
Now, it seems that number has shown up
on the phone that she died with.

184
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,071
It was damaged, but there's technology now

185
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,074
that will give them access to the data
leading up to the day of her death.

186
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,910
Its internal memory. Calls, texts.

187
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,329
It's all there.

188
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
When did you start with us?

189
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,793
A week ago.

190
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,547
And it was the vice president
who brought you on?

191
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,924
That's correct.

192
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,094
A week...

193
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,766
and you're already having confidential
conversations with the president.

194
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,060
I am.

195
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,814
If you hear anything else,
you come directly to me.

196
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,442
Yes, sir.

197
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,784
Whatever you say it is,
it's perjury.

198
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,411
Oh, perjury, huh?

199
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,579
That's where you draw the line?

200
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,456
I'm done.

201
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,792
The case has already been prepared.

202
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,504
TATP was found
on Muhammed Kalabi's computer.

203
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:43,340
It doesn't matter what Secretary Durant
believes or not.

204
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,135
One is speculation, and the other is fact.

205
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,430
Fact? Really? Is that what it is?

206
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,183
If it sounds like a fact,
then it is a fact.

207
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,978
Kalabi had explosive residue
on his keyboard.

208
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,814
You know the rest of the bureau is done
with the president.

209
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,276
I'm not talking to them.
I'm talking to you.

210
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,820
They've looked the other way,
but for how much longer?

211
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,074
Doug... he's done.

212
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,162
- Where does that leave me?
- That's what we're discussing right now.

213
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,207
Do you know what the president thinks?

214
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,542
He thinks you're the leak.

215
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,920
I wish.

216
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,383
I'm going to give you a moment
to take that statement back.

217
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:32,889
I'll do what I have to do. I'll testify.

218
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,976
But the president is done.

219
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,105
He's losing support. You can smell it.

220
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,566
Are you working for anyone else?

221
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,071
- Are you working for anyone else?
- No.

222
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,491
And I don't wanna know anything else.

223
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,909
I'm tired of what I know.

224
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,041
Consider me a proxy.

225
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,337
- What?
- They don't wanna ask, but I will.

226
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,590
You need to be fully committed,
which means being fully transparent,

227
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,759
which means handing over what you have.

228
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,141
Slow down, will you, please?

229
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,226
I'd like to get home, Ms. Davis.

230
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,313
LeAnn? LeAnn?

231
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,529
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep,
just to get out of my apartment.

232
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,616
Being a woman in this city,
the vigilance it takes...

233
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,745
You're not allowed to make a mistake...
get distracted.

234
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,830
It's a heavy price.

235
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,251
To be on the edge that way
for years and years...

236
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,586
My testimony won't disappoint.

237
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,132
Well, the president and vice president
are pleased, I assume.

238
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,469
But how long before the media starts
asking questions about Macallan's death,

239
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,346
and how he was killed?

240
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,683
I have your gun, by the way.

241
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,938
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

242
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,240
Claire?

243
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,828
- Yes?
- Claire?

244
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,250
What's the matter?

245
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,253
Hammerschmidt has a new theory.

246
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,466
He thinks Doug Stamper and I
killed Zoe Barnes.

247
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,470
They may have access to my cell phone,
to my texts.

248
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,016
Someone in this White House is talking
to Hammerschmidt

249
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,435
and now this.

250
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,691
Oh, Doug.

251
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,779
Poor Doug.

252
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,033
Yes.

253
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,080
He's an unlucky person.

254
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,166
Always has been.

255
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,866
- Sir, the senator's support is wavering.
- Doug, it's Claire.

256
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm sorry, I...

257
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,790
Francis and I were wondering if you could
come up to the residence tomorrow evening.

258
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,041
For dinner.

259
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:52,214
It'll give us a chance to take a breath
with all that's been happening.

260
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,981
Hello?

261
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,608
Happy birthday.

262
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,530
- Who is this?
- Come on, you must know by now.

263
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,700
- No, I don't.
- Aidan Macallan.

264
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,703
Look into how he used and abused
the FISA ruling.

265
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,663
How do we know each other?

266
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,999
Now come on. If I told you that,
how can I possibly keep helping you?

267
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,918
And don't you want me to help you?

268
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,505
But where do we meet?
Just give me that.

269
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,299
- In the muck.
- Wait.

270
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,428
Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.
Doug Stamper killed her.

271
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,971
But you already know that.

272
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,474
No, don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

273
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,647
The Judiciary Committee may be hoping
Secretary Durant recovers.

274
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,899
But the rest of the world is waiting
to see

275
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:58,364
how the Syrian president responds
to President Underwood's line in the sand.

276
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,325
Moscow, meanwhile,
calls the president's statements,

277
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,870
"The desperate act of a man
on his way out of office."

278
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,792
Are you in contact with your brother?

279
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,421
No.

280
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,550
- Sundays. Occasional birthday.
- Hmm.

281
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,678
I thought you were closer than that.

282
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,640
No. We usually only speak
when one of us is in trouble.

283
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,726
Well, that's why I ask,

284
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,480
'cause in times like these,
we all need support.

285
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,608
- Well, I'll have counsel.
- No, you'll have the best lawyers.

286
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,818
The best of everything. The best.

287
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,448
Would you like some more fish?

288
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,368
No, thank you.

289
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,163
Whatever the Herald has is circumstantial.

290
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,456
Of course.

291
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,294
No one knows what really happened to her,
and no one ever will.

292
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,130
But, look, Doug...

293
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,592
The reason that Claire
and I invited you over tonight

294
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,930
is because we want you to know
how much you mean to us.

295
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,097
To both of us.

296
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,436
- Yes, sir.
- Before we say anything else,

297
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,063
we just wanted to be
absolutely certain that...

298
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,024
you knew that.

299
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,944
Of course.

300
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,864
What we're up against,

301
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,202
what this administration is facing...
Well, what I'm facing...

302
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,037
Even though both of us believe that

303
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,083
there's very little chance
that I could ever be indicted, we still...

304
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,004
have to find a way to remove
this entire issue from the table.

305
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,758
I just can no longer
be associated with this.

306
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,636
I'll resign while I'm dealing with this.

307
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,310
I think this is going to require
more than that.

308
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,813
Well, I'll make a statement...

309
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,358
and blame it on the politics
of personal destruction.

310
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,111
No, Doug, I'm afraid that's just
not going to be enough.

311
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,742
We have to shift... the suspicion.

312
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,953
We need you to...

313
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:13,749
We need you to implicate yourself
in the death of Zoe Barnes.

314
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
Now, before you react, just listen.

315
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,812
You are the most likely candidate
at this point.

316
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,421
You were distraught, you were drinking.

317
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,756
The... I don't know.

318
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,841
We'll make up some story,
and then we'll leak it.

319
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,718
You... you were loyal, you did it for me.

320
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,888
You were too loyal. You went too far.

321
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,057
And... and then, in the end,
there'll be no question...

322
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,851
Can you excuse me?

323
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,747
Well, it's either a crank looking
for a headline,

324
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,041
or someone on the inside
telling the truth.

325
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:41,086
- What's your sense?
- He knew about the birthday cards.

326
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,463
I don't know.

327
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,008
Maybe the story is the call.
The flash drives. The leaks themselves.

328
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,761
If we call out the leaks,
he may stop contacting me.

329
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,639
And the Macallan business,
is that even a real lead?

330
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,432
None of these sites will admit
to anything.

331
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,184
Because it's an embarrassment.

332
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,520
An overwhelming amount
of Underwood material

333
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,983
was reported by social media users
in counties that he was expected to lose.

334
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,528
But anyone I reach out to
does not wanna be talking about this.

335
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,239
The leak said it was unauthorized
domestic surveillance.

336
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,450
All the administration has to say is
"terror," and they seem justified.

337
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,286
He wasn't rooting out terrorists.

338
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,872
He was trying to win an election.

339
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,708
And very convenient that
the Secretary of State hits her head.

340
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,545
- Now you sound like a conspiracy...
- I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

341
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,172
I try to imagine what it's like
inside his mind,

342
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,174
what I would do if I were him.

343
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,720
And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...

344
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,893
He has no ideology. No North Star.

345
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,604
Isn't that the scariest thing of all?

346
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,732
Tom, do you think Zoe Barnes was murdered?

347
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:47,110
How often does a 27-year-old fall
in front of a train?

348
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:50,572
- All right, then. Let's prove that.
- All right.

349
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,041
What's wrong?

350
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,377
Doug Stamper's office called.
They wanna set up a meeting.

351
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,629
Soon as possible.

352
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,007
This is good.

353
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,845
Whatever your boyfriend read
off your phone this morning

354
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,305
made its way to the right person.

355
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

356
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,104
You're lying to a liar.

357
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,232
You can't get anything
off the phone Zoe died with.

358
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,234
They just need to believe we can.

359
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,696
What is this job?

360
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,992
Not what it used to be.

361
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,836
I don't want you to overreact.

362
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:51,007
But Tom kept writing.
It seems he finally finished his book.

363
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,551
And he alludes to things.

364
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,512
What do you mean "alludes to things"?

365
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,057
I don't know. Lines are blacked out.
It's like it's redacted.

366
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,059
There are paragraphs here and there...

367
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,478
What did you tell him?

368
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,690
What does he know?

369
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,613
Has he shown this to anyone?
Sent it to anyone?

370
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,235
- Publishers, the press?
- I don't know.

371
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,070
Well, what do you know?

372
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,824
I will handle him.
I just wanted you to be aware.

373
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,576
- Son of a bitch.
- I said I'll take care of it.

374
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,872
No, I'll take care of it.
You stay a million miles away from this.

375
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,257
How could you be so stupid...

376
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,386
to fall in love?

377
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,849
This thing isn't on the floor yet,
and we're losing senators.

378
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,642
We're losing some maybe, but...

379
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,062
What I like about the Senate
is what I hate.

380
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:47,814
It's contagious.

381
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,984
One of 'em gets an idea, and it spreads
through the body like a flu.

382
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
- I'll look into it.

383
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,655
There's 100 of 'em.
All we need is half.

384
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,784
Can I just lay down?

385
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,137
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Just for a few minutes.

386
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,665
I'm just so fucking tired,
and I need to think.

387
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,043
...Why do you need to think?

388
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,302
The longer you hang on
to whatever he gave you,

389
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,175
the more danger you're in.

390
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,302
You're reading this wrong.

391
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,013
You think it's some kind of insurance,
but it's not.

392
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,724
LeAnn...

393
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:27,270
Whatever happens to the president,
it's not your fault, or mine.

394
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:30,356
- You don't think I make a difference?
- I didn't say that.

395
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,404
You... you don't think
that I'm dedicated enough?

396
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,906
Too dedicated.

397
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,034
That can be a problem.
That can make you blind.

398
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,535
You have no idea...

399
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,337
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.

400
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,010
What?

401
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,765
I killed Zoe Barnes.

402
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,184
Why would you say that?

403
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,073
All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.

404
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,327
She said she wanted to be invisible.

405
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,705
I knew it wasn't possible.

406
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:36,297
I knew that she would only ever go away...
if I made sure of it.

407
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,428
I don't believe you.

408
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,305
Yes, you do.

409
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,021
Believe me... I deserve this.

410
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,565
Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.
It was ruled an accident.

411
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,360
I pushed her off the platform
and I walked away.

412
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,053
I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.

413
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,349
Telling that committee or her
how I got my liver

414
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,520
is not going to help this administration
or you.

415
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,274
But here is what is going to help.

416
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,947
This is what you're going to tell
that committee about Doug Stamper.

417
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,617
You actually live here?

418
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,830
Well... I'm not here that much.

419
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,207
I let friends use it now and again.

420
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,210
- Thanks for your discretion.
- Of course.

421
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,711
I won't be too long.

422
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,215
Take your time.
If you need anything, I'll be on call.

423
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,551
He's reasonable.

424
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,346
Yeah, he needs to be.

425
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,973
Uh, they didn't look that hard.

426
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,766
The Secret Service knows
I have nothing to hide.

427
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,477
He's downstairs.

428
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,231
Make yourself at home.

429
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,501
I used to love to hide as a kid.

430
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,462
I was really good at it.

431
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,133
I could always choose the best places.

432
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,677
Nobody ever found me.

433
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,683
One time, everybody just gave up.

434
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,355
So I stayed put for, like,
13 hours straight.

435
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,152
What do you want?

436
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,824
He said I wouldn't regret it...
if I said yes.

437
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,245
Francis.

438
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,958
When I agreed to write the book
about his origin story way back when.

439
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,251
Hmm.

440
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,504
Well, he regrets asking you now.

441
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,174
I said yes 'cause
I have always been a sucker

442
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,593
for what people tell themselves
about themselves.

443
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,470
Who has the manuscript?

444
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,184
You do.

445
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
And publishers?

446
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,606
- Not yet.

447
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,277
So what did you think?

448
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,531
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.

449
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:51,409
You portrayed us
like a couple of monsters.

450
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,246
- I never used that word.
- You didn't have to.

451
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,797
On the flight back from Moscow,
not long after we met...

452
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,718
...you and Francis had a fight.

453
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,137
A real knock down.

454
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,015
I told Francis I heard the yelling,
but not the words.

455
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,976
But...

456
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,272
you said you were murderers.

457
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,567
He said you were survivors.

458
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:30,740
I was dreading coming here.

459
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,535
- Why?
- You can't publish it, Tom.

460
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,164
I'd rather not.

461
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,166
So, what? Money?

462
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,837
Yeah... but enough.

463
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:48,508
Enough so I can really get lost
for a while.

464
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,886
Buy some time till I figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

465
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,765
We can figure something out.

466
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,351
I bet.

467
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,150
You know, those parts
you blacked out, that's...

468
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,570
- I've never told anyone but you.
- I know.

469
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,698
I know everything.

470
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,786
But isn't that what you wanted?

471
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,126
I miss touching you.

472
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,588
I don't know how to not be around you.

473
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:33,011
I think of you all the time.
It almost makes me hate you for it.

474
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,734
- I don't know what to do.

475
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:56,576
- You're so beautiful.

476
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,621
- Keep going.
- Not just beautiful, beautiful.

477
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,041
There's lots of people like that.

478
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,467
You are radiant, Claire.
And good. You are so good.

479
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,303
- I'm not good.
- Yes, you are.

480
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:23,728
- Why won't you kiss me?
- I wanna look at you.

481
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,528
I really do wanna go to Greenland one day.

482
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,406
- We should go.
- Don't stop.

483
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,828
It's so frozen and remote.

484
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,374
The way the...

485
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,169
The way the...
Smells before it...

486
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,047
The... You know what I mean?

487
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,142
Help. Help.

488
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,117
Tom?

489
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:49,897
- There are close to half a million dead.

490
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,566
Over four million refugees,

491
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,153
women and children who have left
the region and require care.

492
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:59,282
- At least 12 million displaced people.

493
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,785
Homeless wanderers
who no longer belong anywhere.

494
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:04,745
We are all students of history.

495
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,333
Syria was one of the founding members
of the United Nations, for God's sakes.

496
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,712
How did we get here? We, who sprang from
one of the most ancient civilizations?

497
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,174
At some point, we must accept peace
as the only answer.

498
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,553
All parties must lay down their arms
and begin to talk.

499
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,371
Okay.

500
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,959
You were always good at tracking me down.

501
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,503
It wasn't easy.

502
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,964
Movie theater,
the occasional classified meeting.

503
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,841
I know what you're doing.

504
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,469
Well, that's a bit vague.

505
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,347
You're sabotaging him.
Peeling off senators.

506
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,140
I know it's you.

507
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:50,268
You were much more interesting
when you smoked.

508
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,727
No, I wasn't.

509
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,939
The money's not with him, Mark.

510
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,401
The... the Koch brother types,
Wall Street, oil and gas...

511
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,986
Even labor's walking out on him.

512
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,199
He's more resourceful than you think.
He's done a lot without money, okay?

513
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,160
I want you to back off,
let me handle these hearings.

514
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:10,347
I just got to the White House.
I intend to stick around.

515
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,457
I don't want him to be president.

516
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,465
- The country needs a change.
- Okay, so...

517
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,443
And they don't need to look
any further than his wife.

518
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,596
She's tough, smart.
He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.

519
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,350
Her? You can work with her.
I know you see it, too.

520
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,269
I see a partner when it comes to Syria,
or what's left of it.

521
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,521
Let me try one of those.

522
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,401
I mean, far be it from us to tell
an ancient civilization its business...

523
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:45,740
but Syria is now basically unrivaled
as the most violent place on the planet.

524
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,241
I know, I know.

525
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,830
I'm not saying what to do
with Frank Underwood

526
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,083
- is not gonna be a difficult problem.

527
00:38:56,166 --> 00:39:00,588
But... if we don't establish
a presence in the region...

528
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,549
it's gonna be too late.

529
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,221
- I'd rather have a cigarette.
- Spit it out.

530
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,225
Well... let me buy you dinner
or something.

531
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,021
What? What happened? What's the matter?

532
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,861
I had that child in my arms.

533
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:29,199
I could feel her breath on me,
but I couldn't look down.

534
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,622
Excuse me.

535
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,417
Yeah?

536
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,378
Uh, 20 minutes away.

537
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,174
- Okay. I have to go. I'm sorry.
- Do, please.

538
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,725
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

539
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,985
I need your services.

540
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,738
Jesus.

541
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,532
No.

542
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,116
Now.

543
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,456
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.

544
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,373
I believe he was unstable

545
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,334
and killed her
to benefit Francis Underwood.

546
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,545
Stop. Stop it, please?
Uh, off the record.

547
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,297
Can you give us a second?
I'll call you back in.

548
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,139
Seth, this has nothing to do
with pay for play, or Kalabi,

549
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,391
or anything else
the president is accused of.

550
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,563
- Where are you getting this?
- This is what I know about Doug.

551
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,442
The chair will not let you testify
in front of the committee with this.

552
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,778
- This is what I have.
- Can you prove any of it?

553
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,614
He's implied that he did it.

554
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,283
I can speak to his behavior.
Things that he's done.

555
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,704
You need to go to the US attorney.

556
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,960
Seth, if you don't, I will.

557
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,922
"I told the president there were
four men by the same name

558
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,050
the State Department was tracking.
Two in the United States."

559
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,679
So said a senior White House source,
as quoted in the Washington Herald.

560
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,098
Were you aware of this conversation?

561
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,559
No, sir, I was not.

562
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,021
The source went on.
"I believe the president understood

563
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,191
that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee
was not a legitimate threat."

564
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,318
Was this conveyed to you in any way?

565
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,154
Again, no, sir.

566
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,217
Still, the committee's looking forward to

567
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,035
Secretary Durant's testimony
on this matter.

568
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,705
I have no idea what the secretary
will say or not say, but I...

569
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,291
have great respect for her
and wish her a speedy recovery.

570
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,880
We were operating off of facts and reports
coming in at an accelerated rate that day.

571
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,301
I'll try this again.

572
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:56,346
Did the president indicate to you
at any time

573
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,348
that he knew this was not a threat?

574
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:02,186
No. And I'd like to point out
that I'm proud to be representing

575
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,271
the men and women of the FBI here today,

576
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,399
who conducted that investigation
as they always do

577
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,944
in a competent, honest,
and independent way,

578
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,196
in the finest tradition of the FBI.

579
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,657
- Did they?
- Our people did their job.

580
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:20,412
And it's unthinkable to assume the FBI
would involve itself in an election.

581
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:23,058
Because there may be an innocent man
sitting in a cell as we speak.

582
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,586
I can comment on this
since it was mentioned in the press.

583
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:31,632
Trace amounts of an explosive material
were found on Mr. Kalabi's computer.

584
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:35,636
Your assertion is
that the president was unaware

585
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,480
of what was happening
in his own White House?

586
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,890
Aidan Macallan was an NSA employee,

587
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,811
so, no, the president had no idea
what he was up to.

588
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,480
Honestly, he was quite busy campaigning.

589
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,735
But surely he knew the effects
of Mr. Macallan's work? These exploits?

590
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,027
No.

591
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,863
The president and...
I've been with him out on the stump.

592
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,951
He likes to shake hands.
He's not paying attention to social media.

593
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,829
Ms. Harvey,
there was a FISA ruling issued,

594
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,207
which the Underwood administration used
to spy on American citizens

595
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,730
for the sake of swaying an election.

596
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,796
Congressman Romero,
Aidan Macallan was a troubled person.

597
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,634
His mind worked fast,
faster than I think anyone's should.

598
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,094
What he was up to
went to the grave with him.

599
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,138
Ms. Harvey, please,
spare me the semantics...

600
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,365
- Okay, fine.
- I just need you...

601
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:25,560
Was he collecting data? Yes.
Did he cross a line? Most likely.

602
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,230
I did visit with him,
checking in on his work.

603
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:31,734
Have you seen a screen of code?
Computer code.

604
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,318
It's indecipherable.

605
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,364
Why did Seth Grayson end up
not testifying?

606
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:38,448
No comment.

607
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,576
We heard that his testimony had to do
with the president's chief of staff.

608
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,413
Who I would welcome testifying
in front of our committee.

609
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,499
I urge Doug Stamper
and the rest of the administration

610
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,960
to stop hiding behind executive privilege.

611
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,731
All we learned so far
is that the president knew nothing

612
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,257
about anything going on
in his White House.

613
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:01,221
There were six of them,
and they all took a turn.

614
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,473
Except for Romero.

615
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,184
He only watched.

616
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,812
Or... at least
that's what he told the dean.

617
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,815
But I know the real story.

618
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,567
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.

619
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,873
I thought you had nothing on this guy.
How long have you known this?

620
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,156
I was holding it until...
Or, if we needed it.

621
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,158
No, until you needed it, you mean.

622
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,511
Look, it makes no difference.
I might use it, I might not.

623
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,704
But I still wanna testify.

624
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,497
For you to testify now,
excuse me for saying it, it's crazy.

625
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,166
Do you think it's crazy, Claire?

626
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,336
- I wanna defend myself against this guy.
- We have witnesses.

627
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,588
Our witnesses, surrogates.
Let it come from them.

628
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,048
I think I can win.

629
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,608
Or maybe I should wait
until I lose the Senate...

630
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:38,735
I just think there are other ways...

631
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,597
If you give up executive privilege,
we lose leverage. We lose it all.

632
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,142
Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.

633
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:54,108
I mean, the damage your testimony could do
to your wife is not worth the risk.

634
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,736
Oh, its worth is what
we're here to discuss.

635
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,198
I... I don't appreciate being the one
to tell you this, but...

636
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,202
your presidency is beyond repair.

637
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:09,289
You don't know what I'm going to do next.

638
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,417
Isn't that it?
Isn't that what really bothers you?

639
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,921
Don't think I haven't been watching you
from the moment you stepped on board.

640
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,008
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.

641
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,260
The information about Macallan
is still out there

642
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,263
and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.

643
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,684
You've been sabotaging me from the moment
you stepped into my house.

644
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,856
You don't care for me very much, do you?

645
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,483
No, I don't.

646
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,153
I couldn't care less.

647
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,614
But if you make Claire happy,
that makes me happy.

648
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:46,576
- If you can help her, good.
- What's it worth to you?

649
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,889
Well, what kind of deal
are we talking about?

650
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,123
For me not to testify.

651
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,125
Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.

652
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,669
I can set you up in any number
of lucrative positions.

653
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,630
No, that's not good enough.
Anyone could offer me that.

654
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,341
You tell me.

655
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,677
No, no, no.
It's not going to work like that.

656
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,597
- You tell me what you can do for me.
- I've been around your kind.

657
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,685
Not usually at this level.
But you can't help yourself.

658
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,274
Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.

659
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,362
What is she worth to you?

660
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,699
A lot.

661
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,497
So then here's what I'm thinking.

662
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,625
Do you solemnly swear and affirm

663
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,520
that the testimony you are
about to give is the truth,

664
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,147
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

665
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,547
I do.

666
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,259
Let the record reflect that the witness
has answered in the affirmative.

667
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,721
Mr. President,
I want to thank you for appearing...

668
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,016
and I hope we get to clear some
things up for the American people.

669
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,893
Mr. President, the floor is yours.

670
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,769
You can take as long
or as short as you like.

671
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,022
If you have any written statement,

672
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,025
we will include it after
and it will be part of the record.

673
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,404
- Mr. President, you are recognized.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman...

674
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,574
and to the other members
of this committee.

675
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,037
I have agreed to appear
before this committee today...

676
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,622
because...

677
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,832
I'm guilty.

678
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:27,552
Guilty of having spent
the last 30 years of my life here...

679
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,679
in this Congress.

680
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,224
In this House.

681
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,185
Then as vice president
and now as president,

682
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,771
trying to do the people's work.

683
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,276
Now, this committee has accused me
of a great number of things.

684
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,280
You accused me of pay to play.

685
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:51,076
And so I accuse you of exactly the same.

686
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,414
I also accuse you of playing politics
only when it suits you.

687
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,168
You're all being paid.

688
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,836
You're all serving some master.

689
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:07,092
Each and every one of you,
and you know I know that for a fact.

690
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:10,345
You, for example, Congressman Romero...

691
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,350
and your crusade to take me down,
is it for justice?

692
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,311
For the good of the nation?

693
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,356
Is the truth
what you're really after?

694
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,193
Or is it for some personal gain?

695
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:29,656
Perhaps to try to fill
the small hole in your soul

696
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:33,327
that you sold off a long time ago?

697
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,288
- Mr. President.
- No, no, no.

698
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:40,500
This is my opening statement,
and I will give it in full.

699
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,753
I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.

700
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,425
You accuse me of breaking the rules,

701
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:52,637
and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.

702
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,517
The very rules
that you and I all agreed upon.

703
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:03,440
The very rules
that you and I all wrote together.

704
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,569
So, yes, I'm guilty as hell,
but then so are all of you.

705
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:09,654
Yes, the system is corrupt,

706
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,949
but you wanted a guardian
at the gate like me.

707
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:18,747
And why? Because you know
I will do whatever it takes.

708
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,876
And you have all enjoyed it,

709
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,838
been party to it and benefited by it.

710
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,009
Oh, don't deny it. You've loved it.

711
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,386
You don't actually need me
to stand for anything.

712
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,304
You just need me to stand.

713
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,183
To be the strong man. The man of action.

714
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:43,063
My God,
you're addicted to action and slogans.

715
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,275
It doesn't matter what I say.
It doesn't matter what I do.

716
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:51,238
Just as long as I'm doing something,
you're happy to be along for the ride.

717
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,907
And frankly, I don't blame you.

718
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,453
With all the foolishness and indecision
in your lives, why not a man like me?

719
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:00,497
I don't apologize.

720
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,501
In the end, I don't care
whether you love me or you hate me,

721
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,545
just as long as I win.

722
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,174
The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged.

723
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,847
Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason.

724
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:23,437
There is no right or wrong. Not anymore.

725
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,273
There's only being in...

726
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,693
and then being out.

727
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,283
So I will not be party to this any longer.

728
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:40,662
I will not wear the target
for any of you anymore.

729
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:44,791
You have all used me far long enough.

730
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:47,627
So, the party's over, the ride's done.

731
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,256
I respect the office too much
to allow this to continue going on.

732
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,634
That's why I am announcing
to this committee and to the nation

733
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,886
that as of 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening,

734
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,349
I shall resign the office
of President of the United States.

735
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,017
...Order!

736
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:08,107
And I will be happy to take
any questions you may have.

737
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,943
But my gut tells me
that isn't really going to be necessary.
