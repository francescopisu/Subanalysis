1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,803
I, Claire Hale Underwood,
do solemnly swear

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,766
that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...

3
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:20,103
...I'm proud of her. She deserves this.

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,315
Even if it only lasts
for a couple of weeks.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,485
And will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,530
the Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,121
Congratulations, Madam Acting President.

8
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,978
- Feel different?
- No.

9
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,524
- Liar.
- It's temporary. I'm only acting.

10
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,735
Oh.

11
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,575
You have to now carry this with you
at all times.

12
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,289
- The codes?
- Mmm-hmm. It's the law.

13
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,133
Governor, we just got word

14
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,095
that Vice President Claire Underwood
was sworn in as acting president.

15
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,097
- Were you aware?

16
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,349
Of course.

17
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,435
Do you have any comment?

18
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,895
God bless America.

19
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,897
If Monday's House vote
goes your way,

20
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,734
- and you win the presidency...
- Oh, I'll win, believe me.

21
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,212
You think this vote
will be the charm?

22
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,863
See, Congress is no different
than the rest of the country.

23
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,243
People are sick and tired
of all this confusion and chaos.

24
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,703
The public is not happy.

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,832
If you become president, would
Claire Underwood remain as vice president?

26
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,377
Not if she wants
what's best for the country.

27
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,546
But given the Twelfth Amendment,
would you have a choice?

28
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,108
Uh, no further questions,
everybody.

29
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,132
The governor's here to talk
to members of Congress.

30
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,761
- Thank you so much.

31
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,054
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

32
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,806
- Will?
- I'm fine.

33
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,894
And Rasmussen changed his vote.

34
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,021
Well, he's been waiting a long time
to pay me back.

35
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,664
Creating a deadlock in Rhode Island
just gives him the spotlight.

36
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,109
- He can be convinced.
- Meeting's set for this afternoon.

37
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,404
Yes, but if we can't,
we lose Rhode Island.

38
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,906
He seems to be acting alone,
but that could change.

39
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,616
We will make gains this weekend.

40
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,910
- Shore things up by Monday's vote.
- Mmm.

41
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,750
Mr. President, it's possible
we may need to consider the other option.

42
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,710
A rescheduled election.

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,673
No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line,
and turn some others along the way.

44
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,176
We've arranged sit-downs
for you and Madam President

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,594
with all of the small states.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,681
LeAnn and I can go door-to-door
in Rayburn, Longworth and Cannon.

47
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,099
Three of my favorite buildings
after this one.

48
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,352
What is it?

49
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,691
The McMurdo Research Facility
in Antarctica.

50
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,194
All live feed communications have ceased
or been disconnected.

51
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
However, we have been receiving
texts and e-mails

52
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,491
from an American scientist
stationed there,

53
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:48,496
claiming that an unidentified
occupying military force has landed.

54
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,873
You think the soldiers are Russian?

55
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,249
He thinks so.

56
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,170
They arrived via
unmarked research vessels.

57
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,382
We reached out to Moscow, but they're
denying any official involvement.

58
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,925
Surprise, surprise.

59
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,761
It's a brazen act of aggression.

60
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,905
Well, it's a crime of opportunity.

61
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,099
Petrov thinks the US government
has their eye off the ball.

62
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,809
Well, it doesn't.

63
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,895
Cathy, what's the most recent
communication we've received?

64
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,691
What I'm saying is this aggression
in Antarctica, by powers unknown,

65
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,403
is a direct result of the uncertainty that
our presidential situation has wrought.

66
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,030
Congressman Watts,
since when is Antarctica a concern

67
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,657
for the Congressional Black Caucus?

68
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,135
I hope you're not implying that the caucus

69
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,496
shouldn't have a voice
in international affairs.

70
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,040
I hope that's not what I'm hearing.
Thank you, Randy.

71
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,293
I've called a meeting tomorrow,

72
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,689
for the Congressional Black Caucus,
to discuss our positions,

73
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,384
both foreign and domestic,
before Monday's presidential vote.

74
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,552
Are you considering
shifting your support to Conway?

75
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:49,056
Well, all I can say at this time,
that the most important thing is unity...

76
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,519
and the public's faith
in the institution of democracy.

77
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
That's all for now.

78
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,777
You are in violation
of the Antarctic Treaty System.

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,821
A treaty the USSR signed in 1959.

80
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,366
- We're a new country.
- So you're admitting they are your troops.

81
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm simply stating I need to interpret
agreements signed by the Soviet Union.

82
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,458
In which case, you'd be throwing out
decades of disarmament progress.

83
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,629
The Cold War is over,
Mrs. Acting President.

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,298
Well, then maybe
we need to revisit the treaty.

85
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,511
I'm not interested in revisiting a treaty.
I'm interested in staying in power.

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
And, Claire...

87
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,308
if I could be so familiar.

88
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,810
In my country...

89
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,439
once you're in office, you don't let go.

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,150
- Viktor.
- Mr. President.

91
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,654
You Americans certainly have
a lot of presidents these days.

92
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,450
Yes, you may think that
we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.

93
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:53,621
Distracted? No. No, no. Divided, yes.

94
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,541
American democracy is stronger
than your sad attempt

95
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,960
to take advantage of a bump in the road.

96
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,421
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape

97
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,300
that is so much bigger
than any one of your roads.

98
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,851
Well, Congressman Rasmussen,
we're just surprised to see you come out

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,061
on the wrong end of this, is all.

100
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:21,148
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard
losing the House majority leadership

101
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,775
all those years ago,

102
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:28,114
but there is a difference between
being bitter and being treasonous.

103
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,909
If it's new committee assignments
you'd like, we can certainly arrange that.

104
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,285
It's over.

105
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:38,708
Markets are in free fall.
Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.

106
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,920
What is this? A doodad? A doohickey?
A... pointless award?

107
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,632
Did I mention I hate useless things?

108
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,217
This nation is coming apart at the seams.

109
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,262
Because of you, because of
what you've done to this country.

110
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,391
There it is. How the righteous love to
bemoan their role in middle management,

111
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,478
and condemn those who actually
might have an effect on the world.

112
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,440
- Think of the party, Congressman.
- I am.

113
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,027
What did you think would happen
when you came in here, Francis?

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,695
That you could threaten me,

115
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,198
tell me the DNC'll throw money
at my primary opponent next cycle

116
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,744
if I don't play ball?
Or were you gonna flatter me?

117
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,956
"Elder of the party" this,
"bellwether senior member" that.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,670
You know, I'm somewhat delighted that you
developed a personality at this late date.

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,838
But I would ask you to rethink this.

120
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,717
To come out this way on this thing
in the twilight of your career

121
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,679
will do nothing
but sully your Wikipedia page.

122
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,764
You have no idea, do you?

123
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:41,020
No one hears you walking the halls
of this building... not anymore.

124
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,109
- Who are you working for?
- Excuse me?

125
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,906
I served next to your jellied spine
for two decades.

126
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:57,078
You've never shown an ounce of courage.
You don't have what it takes for revenge.

127
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,456
So someone must have offered you
something rather sweet.

128
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:05,169
Take all of the two hours
you need to reconsider.

129
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,472
One more thing for your signature.

130
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,239
- You can leave this with me.
- Of course.

131
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,911
- And Miss Harvey's waiting.
- Oh, please send her in.

132
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,086
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.

133
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,838
You close the door, please?

134
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,220
What are our chances with a revote?

135
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,430
Or, rather,
what are the president's chances?

136
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,895
I want to know.

137
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,107
If it was in all 50 states, not good.

138
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,319
His unfavorables are still high.
Yours are still not.

139
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,698
But it's hard to argue
with close to 30 years' experience.

140
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,993
Maybe the president is right. Maybe
he does have a better chance in the House.

141
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,787
Don't defer, LeAnn.
Tell me what you think.

142
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,875
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio
is his best shot.

143
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,130
While it's what's best for Frank,
it may not be what's best for you.

144
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,383
Thank you.

145
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,977
You seem like a reasonable man.

146
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,022
I know how to listen,
if that's what you mean.

147
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,291
If the president regains his office...

148
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,609
"If" doesn't make
for a winning opener, Alex.

149
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,862
I'm here because I think he can win.

150
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,281
We often don't see eye to eye, he and I.

151
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:00,409
Uh, and yet, there are ways
we can work together.

152
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,414
Okay, maybe I made a mistake
with the committee.

153
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:06,749
I can be self-righteous.

154
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm trying to clean up the party.
Our party.

155
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,712
And I end up speaking out of turn.

156
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,549
It's enough with the, "It's me, not you."
What can you deliver, Alex?

157
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:19,971
- I can get out of the way.
- Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.

158
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,868
I want to know what's up with
Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.

159
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,740
The president and Congressman Womack,
they have a good relationship.

160
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,649
Oh, I'm sure they do. But I would hate
to see Terry let you down.

161
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,614
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus,
we're done on Monday.

162
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,743
There are a few freshmen
I could reach out to.

163
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,745
They might help keep the CBC together.

164
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,414
You wanna be minority whip.

165
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,500
Only if I deserve to be.

166
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,585
Huh.

167
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,798
I'm trying to get back. Congressman Lewis
is 20 minutes late as usual.

168
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,384
Is there a spot for him
on financial services?

169
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,971
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,814
Doug, stay where you are.

171
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,526
I thought you said
you were telling the CIA to stand down.

172
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,988
I did. So, contrary to your assurances
that Macallan would behave,

173
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,271
we're now dealing with a leak.

174
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,117
- He doesn't want trouble.
- How do you know what he wants?

175
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,078
You find him and you get him here.

176
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,832
As soon as he knows we've backed off,
he will disappear. I promise.

177
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,376
No, that word means nothing to me.

178
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,469
You have a statement?

179
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,348
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks
info dumps coming down the pike?

180
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,435
- You'll know...
- When I need to know. I know.

181
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,354
Which is apparently whenever it hits CNN.

182
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,441
FBI was on high alert.
They investigated every threat.

183
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,234
- Calm down.

184
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,197
I am calm, Doug.
The public's not calm.

185
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,450
Every misstep is highlighted
and heightened.

186
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,161
They wanna know
what happened with their election.

187
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,245
We're fixing it.

188
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,373
Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.

189
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,627
The statement's about the FBI.
Everybody trusts the FBI.

190
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,594
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?

191
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,682
I don't know. Why?

192
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh, somebody from the Herald called.
They were just wondering if you knew her.

193
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,315
I don't.

194
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,033
I need five minutes with this.

195
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,623
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

196
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,976
Am I good with that statement?

197
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,103
I marked it up. It's on my desk.

198
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,694
Throwing the election back
to the states, it gives us less certainty.

199
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,197
I don't think
we can get it done by Monday.

200
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,925
We've been working at it
for weeks, Francis.

201
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,551
Claire, don't let the office
make you careful.

202
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,094
The halls of Congress
have never failed me.

203
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,914
Yes, but the career politicians,
they are more entrenched than ever.

204
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,959
There's a new House,
with members you don't know.

205
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,087
We need to move the playing field
back to the imaginations of the people.

206
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,215
Oh, you have that much faith
in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?

207
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,593
They're going to choose you.
I just know it.

208
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,429
All right.

209
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,141
Set up a meeting.
I'll hear them all out. You win.

210
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,893
Both of us. Both of us.

211
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,230
Good evening.

212
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,522
Eric.

213
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,734
- Feel like you're outside?
- Mmm.

214
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,617
Aren't you supposed to
limit it to 30 minutes?

215
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,280
- Oh, God, Jesus, no.
- Not if you calibrate the workout.

216
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,823
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

217
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:53,369
It's all about listening to your body.
It'll tell you when it's time to rest.

218
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,081
You should listen to the doctors
some of the time, Francis.

219
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,135
I know the Underwoods were worried.
Because they were ready to deal.

220
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,303
To deal with me.

221
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,681
- You're sure it's for real?
- Sure as I can be.

222
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay, we'll be in touch.

223
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,979
Okay.

224
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,901
So call him back.

225
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,530
Making progress on a couple of Dems.

226
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,698
Think Congressman Alspaugh
is about to turn.

227
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,325
We'll see him on Sunday.

228
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,953
Why wait?

229
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:42,584
We need to meet with
the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.

230
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,586
They're in Underwood's pocket.

231
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,840
Yeah. Can you give us a second, everybody?

232
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,092
Uh, sure.

233
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,552
- Come on.

234
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,888
...Thank you.

235
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,942
I just got word from somebody inside.
Womack is losing control of the caucus.

236
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,737
If you win them, you win Monday.

237
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,615
We should try.

238
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,409
All right, fine. Let's do it.

239
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,538
- I'll set it up.
- Are we done here tonight?

240
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,290
You still have a few calls.

241
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,044
Mark, I was thinking,
maybe we could, um...

242
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,172
cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.

243
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,925
We can't cancel any trip,
or any event. We shouldn't.

244
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,679
A second to catch our breath
would be really helpful, I think.

245
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,433
This is what it is, Hannah.
If you need to take a break, you can.

246
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,768
Darling, we haven't slept all week.

247
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,313
You're exhausted.

248
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,532
- I... Just an idea.
- What's my next call?

249
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,839
But you're not enjoying yourself.

250
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,343
Because he won't listen to me.

251
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,303
He can't win in the House.

252
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about you.

253
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,061
What difference does it make
whether I'm enjoying myself or not?

254
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,938
Isn't that what this is all about?

255
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,944
Can't you just...
live in it for a second?

256
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,780
You are in charge.

257
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,865
- Yes, but...
- Come here.

258
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,369
- Come.

259
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,918
You could wake up tomorrow...

260
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,171
and...

261
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,966
I don't know, feed the children...

262
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,427
...start a war...

263
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,262
You know what? I'm sorry.

264
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,765
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.

265
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,436
No, you're right.

266
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,064
Let's not talk about anything
that happens outside of this room.

267
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,202
The sanctions are meant to target
the oligarch class in Russia.

268
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,872
And the more members we have on board
before I sit down with President Petrov,

269
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,041
the quicker this will resolve itself.

270
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,339
We are. We are prepared to release
some of our strategic reserves

271
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,631
to keep prices down.

272
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,386
Contact Ambassador Caspi
and buy me 15 more minutes.

273
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,932
Uh, please don't think of this
as a deal with the Underwoods.

274
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,519
To be frank,
they could be gone by Monday.

275
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,814
That's not what I wish, of course.

276
00:21:55,897 --> 00:22:00,611
But know that you are working more
with me on this than with them.

277
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,759
Congressman Watts.

278
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,136
Governor, we're so happy
you could join us today.

279
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,097
As am I. The black community
deserves so much better

280
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,849
than Frank Underwood's failed policies.

281
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,685
That we can agree on. I look forward
to hearing about your platform.

282
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,829
- Shall we?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

283
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,148
We have just a bit more private
caucus business to attend to first.

284
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,442
Excuse me?

285
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,462
This is a meeting
of the Congressional Black Caucus.

286
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,321
Well, I understand.
That's... why we're here.

287
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,784
I was told 9:00,
and it's already been an hour.

288
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,969
You should have been told 10:00.

289
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,121
And you will get your opportunity
to address us.

290
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,875
- I appreciate your patience.

291
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,302
I'm not gonna beg.

292
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,555
No, you're gonna smile.

293
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,144
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested
in Tennessee

294
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,938
is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.

295
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,273
Can you prove it wasn't
just a bureaucratic mix-up?

296
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,356
Uh, not yet.

297
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,071
What else?

298
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,616
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit
was kicked back to the lower court,

299
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,869
- SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.
- Do you read the paper, Sean?

300
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,872
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.

301
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,917
Declaration of war?

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,587
Underwood was so evangelical,
but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.

303
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,422
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

304
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,012
Lisa Williams.

305
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,725
What about Lisa Williams?

306
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:56,852
I saw you talking.

307
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,730
I thought she might be a lead
worth pursuing.

308
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,814
She's not.

309
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,359
She's using what she read in the paper
to get attention or a little cash.

310
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,442
I did some digging.

311
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:09,197
She and Rachel Posner both went
to a church called the Fellowship.

312
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,074
- Rachel disappeared...
- Stop.

313
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,201
No more conspiracy theories
about dead girls.

314
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,721
But people love stories about dead girls.

315
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,999
The next House vote
is the day after tomorrow.

316
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:24,880
The natives are restless, outraged,
just plain scared, actually.

317
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,759
They want to wake up in the America
that they fell asleep in.

318
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:40,061
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.
See if you can connect Underwood to it.

319
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:56,119
So, this is the James S. Brady
press briefing room.

320
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,374
And under our feet is
actually a swimming pool.

321
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,293
It was built by the March of Dimes

322
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,378
for President Franklin Roosevelt,
who had polio.

323
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:08,799
And this pool was really
the only way for him to exercise.

324
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,383
It was, uh, an open secret

325
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,761
that the president used a wheelchair
most of the time.

326
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,263
Which is why the White House

327
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:19,225
was one of the first wheelchair-accessible
government buildings.

328
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,895
- But everyone pretended he could walk?
- Yes.

329
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,856
- That's a bit of grace.
- Yeah.

330
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,817
A thing not spoken?

331
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,403
Yeah, this building literally changed
because of his disability.

332
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:33,949
But people just respected him,
respected his, uh...

333
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,158
Right.

334
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:39,621
That office used to carry
so much weight, so much, uh, respect.

335
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,582
You don't think it does anymore?

336
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,501
No, oh, no, no!
I'm not saying that.

337
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,672
I was giving you a hard time.
I know what you meant.

338
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,803
Anyway, sorry,
didn't mean to hijack the tour.

339
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,058
Moving on...

340
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,694
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.

341
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,368
I could come here today

342
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,163
and talk about federal sentencing
disparities between crack and cocaine,

343
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,209
which obviously are racially motivated.
- I'm sorry, but are you asserting

344
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,045
that the crack epidemic
is exclusive to the black community?

345
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,881
No, not at all.

346
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,550
But I think it's fair to say
that sentencing discrepancies

347
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,929
have disproportionately
affected minority populations.

348
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,931
We're not one-issue voters.

349
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,767
Of course not. That's what I'm getting at.

350
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,286
The whole point of today's meeting
is to broaden our platform.

351
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,562
Republicans are always
dwelling on crime, Governor.

352
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,273
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.

353
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,525
We expected you
to come in here with a plan.

354
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,027
And I do have a plan.

355
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,530
Concentrating on a few pieces
of onerous legislation is not a plan.

356
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,508
- Let's be clear...
- That kind of talk we've heard before.

357
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,284
- I'm a Republican.
- Oh, here we go.

358
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,702
You're not listening.

359
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,164
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.

360
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,212
Unbelievable.

361
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,548
That's my platform.

362
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,927
Well...
I've heard enough.

363
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:24,100
So, does anyone else have
any questions for the governor?

364
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,144
Well, I have a question.

365
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,273
What has Francis Underwood
ever done for you?

366
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,197
This little charade
this morning...

367
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,742
- Well done. Quite an act.
- Will.

368
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,243
- Governor.
- No, but really.

369
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,662
See, you may have differences with me...

370
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,875
You may have genuine differences with me.

371
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,627
But see, that's the operative word,
"genuine."

372
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,464
Can someone here please explain to me

373
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,718
why you all are still so loyal
to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?

374
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,473
One of these days

375
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:08,770
the members of this room will realize how
much you actually prop up the status quo.

376
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,023
And how's that working for ya?

377
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,693
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen
and women for their time?

378
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,711
You've made a mistake.

379
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,511
What we're proposing is a new election
in the two states

380
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:45,473
that weren't able to provide
valid electors by the safe harbor date.

381
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,058
- Can we even do this?

382
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,102
Hold on. Hold on, everyone!

383
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,148
I'd like to know, where does
the attorney general stand on this?

384
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,191
Looking into it, but on board.

385
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,279
Bob, there's no precedent here.
There's no playbook.

386
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:03,699
We can look to the Constitution
for inspiration, but not for instruction.

387
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,327
Thursday's vote showed
Democrats are coming to their senses.

388
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,121
We lost one vote, Jordan.

389
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,331
We can go back and forth
like this forever.

390
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,501
As one of the few Republicans in the room,
it needs to be said.

391
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:17,213
The stability of our country
is more important than the presidency.

392
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,508
Not if people believe the president is
being chosen behind closed doors.

393
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,845
A process that is laid out
in the Constitution.

394
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,057
The same process that can keep us
gridlocked for the next two years.

395
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,725
The House should
and will decide.

396
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,895
Delaware has one congressman.

397
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:35,690
How will that play in Austin
when your opponent in two years

398
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,068
tells voters that you allowed
a state like Delaware

399
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,903
to have the same influence as Texas?

400
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,866
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger
of losing your seats.

401
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,746
And there it is.

402
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,083
Look. Look at them.

403
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,212
That is the look of contemplating loss.

404
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:00,006
Loss...

405
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:06,179
the only constituent that
anyone in this room really listens to.

406
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,099
I, for one, would like to hear how
the president feels about all this.

407
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,942
- Well, I've made my...
- I think we could...

408
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,770
No, Mr. President.
You haven't spoken much here.

409
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,024
We believe in one person, one vote.

410
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,986
If we take that away,
then what is this country?

411
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,324
- Isn't that right, Mr. President?
- Absolutely, Madam President.

412
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,625
Oh, wait, hold it.
Let me just move down a bit.

413
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,836
I keep slipping off the podium.

414
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,254
- Oh, you got me.
- That better?

415
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,757
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

416
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,720
So the Lincoln...

417
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:50,598
- That was actually his office?
- Can we... can we not?

418
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:52,808
- Can you... can you move me up a bit?
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,561
...Okay.

420
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:10,410
- How'd it go?
- We'll see.

421
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,246
I need you to look over
the Antarctica statement again.

422
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,705
Whatever you need.

423
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,707
- Walk with me?
- Mmm.

424
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,336
I'm worried about Francis.

425
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,465
- Why?
- I might need you to save me.

426
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:32,640
- This is not going to work.
- Why?

427
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,809
If he loses, I still lose.

428
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,937
He cannot be on the outside looking in.

429
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,064
He'll win.

430
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,234
- You actually believe that?
- Sure... why not?

431
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,117
It was a wager.
The potential gains made it necessary.

432
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,995
It was a complete
waste of my time.

433
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,788
If you don't start turning things around,

434
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,499
you're going to be out
on your fucking ass. You understand?

435
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,252
I do.

436
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:08,551
I should explain something to you,
Governor.

437
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,474
If you ever
talk to me like that again...

438
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,436
I'll make sure you never win
another election in your life.

439
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,733
- Are you threatening me?
- No, I'm enlightening you.

440
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,263
- Hey.
- Governor Conway. Hello, sir.

441
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,765
How you doin'?
Take a peek,

442
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,435
if you don't mind, Captain?
- Governor.

443
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,521
I used to fly, too, you know.

444
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,606
What kinda max thrust
you get on these engines?

445
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,526
- Uh, about 6,400 pounds.
- 6,400 pounds.

446
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,279
I used to fly something a lot bigger,
a lot more power,

447
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,324
but it was so weighed down
with all the weaponry,

448
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,702
- it was like flying a tank.

449
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,080
Hey, um,

450
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,124
why don't you let me in for a second,
just flip me the controls?

451
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,459
I'm sorry, sir. I can't.

452
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,878
Come on, I... I just want to
feel the weight on the stick for a second.

453
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,024
I wish I could, but, uh,
you're not on the flight plan.

454
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,926
You know I've been in situations,
where, like, I've been shot at.

455
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:14,927
You realize that, right?

456
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,639
You don't think I can handle a twin engine
at 35,000 feet,

457
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,767
straight and level over some farm country?
I mean, come on, sir.

458
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,893
- Sir.

459
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,146
You should probably
go back to the main cabin.

460
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,694
You know I'm gonna
be the president, right?

461
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:34,322
- I hope so, sir.
- You hope so?

462
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,159
- I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
- I'm gonna be the president,

463
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,829
and you're going to flip me
those motherfucking controls.

464
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,414
Will, come on.

465
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,709
- What? What do you want?
- I just...

466
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,629
I need to talk to you
for a minute, please.

467
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,346
I was just talking to the pilots.

468
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:03,184
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
Breathe.

469
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:08,439
- Will, why don't you sit down?
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

470
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,734
I'll fire you.
I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.

471
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,612
Okay.

472
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,451
What the fuck are you gonna do?

473
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,832
Sit down and try and act like an adult...

474
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,461
or at least like the next President
of the United States.

475
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,841
Sit.

476
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,114
- Who are they?
- Maybe Indonesian secret police?

477
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,784
What if we don't pay?

478
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,746
Are there other buyers?

479
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,873
I don't know.

480
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,839
I'll take care of it.

481
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,632
- How?
- Don't ask how.

482
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,218
I'll get Macallan back.

483
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,429
Obviously, this stays between us.

484
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,517
Say, "Thank you, Doug."

485
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,812
Thank you, Doug.

486
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,403
We met on a bus.

487
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,613
She was listening to music.

488
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,906
And I asked her to go
to this church I used to go to.

489
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,201
- Where was that?
- Maryland.

490
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,663
The Winter's Run Fellowship.
About an hour north of Baltimore.

491
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
So, then what?

492
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,167
I don't know. We just...

493
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:55,129
became friends.
And then it became more than that.

494
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,757
Started spending every night together.

495
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,052
At some point, she told me about this guy
who used to come around to check on her.

496
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,889
- What'd he look like?
- I never saw him.

497
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,767
Just sometimes she said he was coming,
so she couldn't hang out.

498
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,690
She wouldn't really
tell me anything about him.

499
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,106
Everything okay?

500
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:16,609
Yeah, do you mind?
I just need to see my friend up there.

501
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,826
Hey.

502
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,747
How are you doing?

503
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,000
Thanks.

504
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,922
You think there's oil there.
You're positioning to stake a claim.

505
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,132
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.

506
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:47,265
We're willing to recommend changes
to the Antarctic Treaty parties.

507
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,352
What happens to you when
the Underwoods are ejected from office?

508
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,440
You teach international relations
at a university?

509
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,108
- Or work for a think tank?
- I haven't thought that far ahead.

510
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,694
I think you have.

511
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,904
How long do you expect
the world to believe

512
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:06,367
those aren't your soldiers?
- Do you like working for the Underwoods?

513
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,245
How loyal are you?

514
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:17,462
When the time comes,
will you stand with them... or not?

515
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,925
I leave tomorrow.

516
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,555
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.

517
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,139
Let's meet before you go.

518
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,021
You're a career diplomat, a professional.

519
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,024
Maybe that's why I trust you.

520
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,403
Then you take care of them,

521
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,072
so they feel good
and they take care of you.

522
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:49,118
So you feel good because...
I mean, Rachel was really beautiful.

523
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,537
You could tell that
from across the street.

524
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,956
I never saw her
from across the street, though.

525
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,042
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?

526
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,003
A lot of people, I think,

527
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,340
they spot the one they love
from across the street sometimes.

528
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,635
It's like they're running an errand,
and they happen to spot

529
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:10,390
the one they love across the street
running a different errand.

530
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,517
There's this sudden thrill, like...

531
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:18,898
while the person you love
is inhabiting the same world as you.

532
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:22,568
And they're just walking around,
buying, I don't know...

533
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:27,532
Vitaminwater, and maybe they know that
you love them while they're doing it,

534
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,619
and maybe it means
they're nice to a cashier.

535
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,581
I never got to see her
from across the street, though.

536
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,291
It just never happened.

537
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,710
I don't want you to burn yourself.

538
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,673
...No burning, no.

539
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,803
Rachel liked to smoke.
She said she was gonna stop,

540
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,697
but she would have a rule
that she'd only smoke

541
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,724
when we listened to
this one band we both loved.

542
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,645
Because of the ceremony.

543
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,027
"It should be a ceremony,"
it's what she said.

544
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,334
Well, even if it's gum,
I still prefer to step outside to chew it.

545
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,797
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.

546
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,341
The things we miss, the rituals...

547
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,136
Excuse me.

548
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,057
- She doesn't like me.
- She will.

549
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,829
Thanks for coming out here
and meeting with him.

550
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,938
You know you can't legally
remove Claire Underwood,

551
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,148
even if you win in the House?
- I'm working on that.

552
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,484
I'm not interested.

553
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,823
He needs you. I need you.
So does the country.

554
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,908
I'm not a politician.

555
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,662
I can give orders, I can follow orders
and I know when the hell to shut up.

556
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,999
And you're a steady hand,
which, again, the country needs.

557
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,628
- I'm not gonna be Conway's patsy.
- No, you're not.

558
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,714
- He's a difficult man to be around.

559
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,967
It's over. It's over.
The process chose Claire Underwood.

560
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,260
We'll get there.

561
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:20,102
You'll be called vice president,
but you will be, de facto, something more.

562
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,195
What were you doing there?

563
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,492
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.

564
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,745
Why the hell did you think
that was an appropriate thing to do?

565
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,747
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?

566
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,707
Is it still a lead?
Because nobody's on it.

567
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,043
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie,

568
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,254
and everything she said to me
is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto,

569
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:48,422
which has been picked apart

570
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,592
by every message board
and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.

571
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,970
At first, Grayson said
her name didn't ring a bell,

572
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,532
but then he called me out of the blue

573
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,391
and asked me if we were
still looking into it. So I followed up.

574
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,356
You looked through my notes.

575
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:14,323
You're out.

576
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,993
- What?
- You're fired, Jeffries.

577
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,913
It's a story. I was following it.

578
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,166
I don't want you on my team.
Get out of my office.

579
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,897
We know we can win both states.
Why would we not take this deal?

580
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,315
No. The Underwoods want a revote

581
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,860
because they know
they can't win in the House. We can.

582
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,738
We need to make a deal that forces
Claire Underwood to resign.

583
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,531
- And why does that matter?
- If I may?

584
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,450
- Madam Speaker.
- Speaking from the Hill,

585
00:42:58,533 --> 00:42:59,534
as vice president,

586
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,912
she'll have a public pulpit
to discredit your every move.

587
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,499
Oh, I'm going to exile Claire Underwood
to the Naval Observatory

588
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,544
and stack her schedule
with state funerals in Southeast Asia.

589
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:12,148
She'll never see the inside
of the West Wing, let alone the Oval.

590
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,134
You need Brockhart by your side,
supporting you.

591
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:17,738
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.

592
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,972
What matters is that
Will becomes president.

593
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,016
Underwood in office
can cause damage.

594
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,309
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.

595
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:28,689
I want this election to be
between me and Francis Underwood.

596
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,024
Well, it isn't up to you.

597
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,110
Speaker McCarthy isn't letting
this particular bill to the floor,

598
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,113
unless we have an amendment attached
that removes Claire Underwood.

599
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,239
Oh...

600
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,742
Will...

601
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,412
Now, if you expect a willing partner
in the White House,

602
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,331
you'd better let that bill get
to the floor as is.

603
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:54,089
If you get to the Oval, Will, you're gonna
need the Speaker more than she needs you.

604
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:59,011
So, I'm gonna call her back,
and you are going to apologize.

605
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,184
Will.

606
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,897
Will, get back here!

607
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:12,607
Will!

608
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,530
Enough.

609
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,078
Shut the door.

610
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,298
You look like death.

611
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,760
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.

612
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,849
It's been radio silence
for almost 24 hours.

613
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,731
There's rumors they don't even
have him anymore.

614
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:01,448
I can't keep this
from the president any longer.

615
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,746
Okay.

616
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,499
And then I'll tell him
what a big help you've been.

617
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,799
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.

618
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,637
Deal with Secretary Durant
or with some very unhappy billionaires.

619
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,933
You will allow me to
exploit whatever oil I find in Antarctica.

620
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:31,228
And I'll tell you why.
I have something.

621
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:36,150
- Or rather, someone you need.
- What are you talking about?

622
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,818
Someone in your administration

623
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,196
was willing to pay a great deal of money
for his safe return.

624
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:48,078
Your Aidan Macallan.
He's here. In the Kremlin.

625
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,373
Who do you think orchestrated that leak?

626
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:53,542
Seems to know quite a lot.

627
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,879
Excuse me one moment.
The Secretary of State is here.

628
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,047
Madam Secretary.

629
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,506
Gentlemen.

630
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:03,010
- You must know Aidan?
- I don't believe I do.

631
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,598
Nice to meet you.

632
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,978
- You're American?
- I am.

633
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,605
Before we begin,
I'd just like you to know

634
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:20,527
that the president
and the former president are on the line.

635
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,529
Cathy...

636
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,698
You can pick up the phone,
if you like.

637
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,080
Mr. President.

638
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,958
It's best you come back
to Washington.

639
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,344
Find anything yet?

640
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:48,097
Not yet.

641
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,976
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,
for letting me take a look.

642
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,894
I won't be long.

643
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,438
This is everything?

644
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,523
This is everything
they sent from Zoe's apartment.

645
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,694
I just, you know...

646
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,448
I just can't seem to throw anything out.

647
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,413
I mean, it's just papers, but...

648
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,587
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

649
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,257
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

650
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,275
Okay.

651
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,406
The Black Caucus? Really?

652
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,284
I like Mark,
because I always know where he stands.

653
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,994
It's usually on someone's neck.

654
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,638
What did you buy yourselves,
another day?

655
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,581
Enough time to talk
to David Rasmussen,

656
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,458
who you clearly spoke to before.

657
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,586
And to meet with Jordan Sadowsky
and the rest of the Republican leadership.

658
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,921
And what happens Tuesday?
Or Wednesday?

659
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:49,301
Look, I... I can have David and the House
vote on this every single session.

660
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,804
Our backgrounds are different, but we're
both hardscrabble boys at heart.

661
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,058
We need the last word,
last blow, last move.

662
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,809
We can push the bill through the House

663
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:00,479
for a new election for president
in Tennessee and Ohio.

664
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,147
Speaker McCarthy
won't let that happen.

665
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:06,360
But I could... convince her

666
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,195
if you were to step down,

667
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,572
and our full tickets
president and vice president

668
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,992
run against each other
in Tennessee and Ohio.

669
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,619
Well, to hell with that.
Well, to hell with that.

670
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,957
We'll make the deal.
I think this is the right thing to do.

671
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,603
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention
to step down after the revote.

672
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,671
I'll let the Speaker know
to put the bill on the floor.

673
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,840
We have one more outstanding
piece of business,

674
00:49:28,923 --> 00:49:30,634
the Supreme Court nominee.

675
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,512
We'll need to appoint someone
to break the four-four deadlock.

676
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,680
Approve Congress' new election date.

677
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,851
- We, uh, have several people in mind.
- I want you to appoint Elizabeth Benson.

678
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,439
Well, she's liberal enough
for you to swallow,

679
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,358
and conservative enough when it counts.

680
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,318
We don't have time
for Senate hearings.

681
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,112
I can make a recess happen.

682
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,917
I'll see you on the campaign trail.

683
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,013
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?

684
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,391
I went out on a limb here.

685
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,893
If we don't have
a vote in the House, then what?

686
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:25,105
- Mark Usher is your friend, not mine.
- Mark Usher's no one's friend.

687
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,775
Francis Underwood
hasn't won a thing, okay?

688
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:31,320
And there's a good...
More than a good chance that Will Conway

689
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,697
will be the next President
of the United States.

690
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,984
Could you give me a moment?
It's been a difficult few days.

691
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,116
...Better?

692
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,408
Yes.

693
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,247
We couldn't let the House vote
proceed on Monday.

694
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,373
Why not?

695
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,750
Because you would've lost.

696
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,172
Even if Conway took the presidency,
we would've had a foothold with you.

697
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,008
We could've sabotaged,
just like we did with the Walkers.

698
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:39,053
- The Conways are not the Walkers.
- It wasn't your decision to make.

699
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:41,556
Excuse me?

700
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,976
You said it yourself. You're only acting.

701
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:54,944
I agreed with Usher

702
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,907
because he will sacrifice everything
to get Brockhart into office,

703
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,868
which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.

704
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:03,828
I thought you saw what I saw.

705
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:09,918
I did. I do.
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.
