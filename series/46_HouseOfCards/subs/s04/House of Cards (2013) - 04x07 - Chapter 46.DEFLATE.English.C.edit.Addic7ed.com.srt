<i>...supporting my efforts

00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,658
<i>and to restore integrity
to the Oval Office.</i>

00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:01,496

00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,835

7
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,756

<i>for president.</i>

11
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,058
<i>That was Heather Dunbar from her campaign
headquarters in Washington.</i>

12
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,686
<i>With Dunbar out,
that leaves President Underwood</i>

13
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,520

15
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,075
Good morning.

16
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,624
Good morning.

17
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,221
Mommy?

18
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,401
Hello, darling.

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,862
- I want breakfast.
- You want breakfast?

20
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,823
- Where's Daddy?
- Oh, he's getting ready for work.

21
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,242
I'm gonna cut your hair.

22
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,828
- No! No! No!
- I'm gonna cut your hair.

23
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,707
- No! No! No! No!
- What do you mean "no"?

24
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:13,628
No!

25
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,923
I'm gonna make you a little bald boy.

26
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,842
- No! No, shave Mom's head, not mine!
- Shave Mom's head? Okay.

27
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,343
- No! No!
- I'll shave Mom's head.

28
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,429
- No.
- I'll shave Mom's head.

29
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,398
We've been moving so quickly.

30
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,987
Maybe we should take a step back.
Think this through again.

31
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,700
We can't afford to be weird
with each other, Claire.

32
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,994
Weird?
What do you mean?

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,999
I saw you in the bathroom...
looking at me.

34
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,627
It's not the first time.

35
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,426
Sometimes I want to say something,
I just don't know what to say.

36
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,931
- It's uncomfortable.
- Maybe it will always be like that.

37
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,854
But we have to separate that out.
It can't affect our plan.

38
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:19,486
Because that's the one thing...
that we have figured out.

39
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,376
When Walker and Vasquez...
betrayed us,

40
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,462
pulled the Secretary of State
right out from under my feet,

41
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,633
there was no room for doubt,
and you made me remember that.

42
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,137
We took a path...

43
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,807
a difficult one, because we had no
guarantee where it was going to lead us.

44
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,145
It took a steel goddamn stomach,

45
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,772
and so has everything else
we had to do since.

46
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,153
So don't worry about you and me now.

47
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,240
Find your steel, Claire.

48
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,513
Thank you all very much for coming.

49
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,932
Have you seen this?

50
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,142
Hmm?

51
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,981
ICO.
Islamic Caliphate Organization.

52
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,442
Ahmed and Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

53
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,987
They've been smart about keeping split up.
If one dies, the other takes over.

54
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,406
But they're holding
a planning session in northern Syria.

55
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,699
Both are there right now.

56
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,909
I got my ass handed to me
over the Jordan Valley.

57
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,744
I'm not gonna launch a missile strike

58
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,456
unless I believe that there's
an overwhelming national security threat,

59
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,375
and I'm just not convinced
that they pose one.

60
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,669
The president believes
ICO to be a serious threat.

61
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,215
We believe they are actively
recruiting American citizens.

62
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:08,553
Accordingly, the government is requesting
a Section 702 upstream surveillance order.

63
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:13,100
- Domestic surveillance.
- Monitoring traffic, not individuals.

64
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,018
Approach the bench.

65
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,729
The FISA Court.
Classified rulings behind closed doors.

66
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,357
Not even these men know
we have a lawyer in there this morning.

67
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,151
ICO already has three oil fields
under their control.

68
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,321
They made a fortune selling crude
when Russia cut down production.

69
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,741
It's blowback, sir.
It's our responsibility to address it.

70
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,163
If we launch strikes,
we radicalize even more extremists.

71
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,165
Sir, their army will grow.

72
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,668
The Ahmadis are former Baathists
with strong business ties.

73
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,505
We can cut the head off before
they get bigger if we strike now.

74
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840
If the threat level increases,
we'll reassess.

75
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,968
Sir,
we have a very limited window.

76
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,887
General, the president's
made his decision.

77
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,973
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

78
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,061
I have rubber-stamped some borderline
requests, Steve, but this is very--

79
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,398
I know. I was surprised, too.
But it's straight from the White House.

80
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,567
Well, this is going to take some time.
I have to do a proper review.

81
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,322
This gun was illegally
obtained by a career criminal

82
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,285
at a gun show
where background checks aren't mandatory.

83
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,456
This gun killed Officer Dempsey's partner
at a routine traffic stop.

84
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:24,129
This one was ordered on the Internet.
No background checks.

85
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,300
This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's
14-year-old son.

86
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,141
And this is the gun
that killed Agent Edward Meechum.

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,312
Not many Secret Service agents
buried at Arlington.

88
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,522
I'd say he earned his place.

89
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,900
I took it for granted,
how important he was to me,

90
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,569
how much I leaned on him.

91
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,364
It's clear to me now,
now that he's gone.

92
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,869
I don't wanna make
the same mistake with you, Donald.

93
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,708
- How do you mean?
- I didn't realize how much I lean on you.

94
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:07,255
The way you handled everything
after I was shot, it was masterful.

95
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,177
Well, I... I guess
I kept my head above water.

96
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,349
Claire told me how supportive you were,
what a natural leader you proved to be.

97
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,602
I want that by my side, Donald,

98
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,897
the same way that Meechum was,
as my running mate.

99
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,900
You want me on the ticket?

100
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,738
A heartbeat away from the presidency
is a serious matter now.

101
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,031
Conway is a tough opponent.

102
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,412
I never expected you'd want me.
I thought I was just a placeholder.

103
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,166
No, we can win, Donald.
You and I, together.

104
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,377
I don't know, Frank.

105
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,258
You need someone who's hungry for this.
I'm not a great campaigner.

106
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,802
- Vermont doesn't help you.
- You have a deep sense of duty,

107
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:59,599
like all the men and women here
who served their country,

108
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,560
and that's far more important
to me than strategy.

109
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,693
To be honest,
I don't know if I want it, Frank.

110
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,823
When I had to take over,
the stress, the responsibility...

111
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,745
Two weeks as president
was about as much as I can handle.

112
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,053
I'm disappointed, Donald.

113
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,182
But I understand.

114
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,017
And I won't pressure you.

115
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,648
Should we do this?

116
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,651
Okay.

117
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,583
Do you have
other folks in mind, if it isn't me?

118
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
Well, we should probably
reach out to the leadership,

119
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,795
and get their advice.

120
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,129
But you're right.

121
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,676
Whoever it is,
they need to be hungry for it.

122
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,012
All of these deaths
could have been prevented.

123
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,431
And that's why

124
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,141
I'm working with a coalition of senators
to introduce a law

125
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,977
that will extend background checks

126
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,565
to all gun transactions,
including gun shows and online sales.

127
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,610
And let me be clear,
this is not an assault on gun ownership.

128
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,404
It's an assault on illegal gun ownership.

129
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,492
I'll now take questions.

130
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,578
The next President
of the United States,

131
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,081
the love of my life, the best father
a mother could hope for,

132
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,627
my husband, Will Conway.

133
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,674
Conway! Conway! Conway!

134
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,100
Hello, New York!

135
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,520
<i>He's ahead by double digits
in every battleground state.</i>

136
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,522
<i>The RNC is raising
two-to-one what we have.</i>

137
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,275
<i>- This guy is a rock star.
- We need our own rock star.</i>

138
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,318
Who are you thinking of,
Mr. President?

139
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,611
Donald Blythe.

140
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,200
Uh, don't you think
there's a more strategic choice?

141
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,287
I am being strategic.

142
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,830
Look, it's one thing
that Dunbar's dropped out,

143
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,332
but we have to get her supporters.

144
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,043
And Donald Blythe, he oozes integrity.

145
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,505
He can help us get all of those
disillusioned people back into our camp.

146
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,964
What about moderates in the general?

147
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,009
- We need somebody from a swing state.
- With deep fundraising pockets.

148
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,429
Well, look,
we can sell Donald's experience.

149
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,723
He's filled the shoes. I see no reason
to change horses midstream.

150
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,727
- He doesn't check off enough columns.
- We want a fighter, not a professor.

151
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,729
I agree, sir.
We can do better than Blythe.

152
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,650
Well, I am hard-pressed
to come up with anyone better

153
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,403
than a man who actually knows
what it's like to sit at that desk.

154
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,614
We can offer you some names.

155
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,283
- He'll be devastated.
- Let me talk to him.

156
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,118
No, it's better that I do.
Let me talk to him.

157
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,704
We'll get you that list right away.

158
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,914
Well, all right. If you can come up
with some alternatives,

159
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,334
I'm certainly willing to listen.
Thank you all very much.

160
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,128
And I believe the best government
is that which governs least.

161
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,428
That's not a new idea.
It's an old one.

162
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,847
The founder of our party,
Jefferson, said it.

163
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,016
We need to make it new again.

164
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,729
We need a government that doesn't
interfere with people's lives,

165
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,773
with their liberty,
with their pursuit of happiness.

166
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,235
Isn't that what we need to protect?

167
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:46,534
Yes. And that's where President Underwood
is failing us the most.

168
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,202
Doug, where are we on the, uh--

169
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,455
FISA Court could take a while.
The judge was reluctant.

170
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,291
- I should set up a meeting anyway.
- I've never liked this plan, sir.

171
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,128
I don't think we should do anything
until we get the court ruling.

172
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,589
Plan A is in motion,
let's let that pan out first.

173
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,009
If plan A works, then fine,
Pollyhop is no longer a problem,

174
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,011
but if it doesn't, I need to start
laying the groundwork.

175
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,515
- Macallan could take some convincing.
- We don't know this man--

176
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,684
Yeah, we don't absolutely need
to widen the circle right now.

177
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,769
We do, sir.

178
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,312
Just to get this sort of surveillance
operational can take weeks.

179
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,525
Yeah, but Doug is right.
We don't know him. He's a stranger to us.

180
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,612
He is the top data scientist
in the country, maybe the world.

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,365
- He was exploring behavior adoption and--
- Stop.

182
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,413
We are talking
domestic surveillance, LeAnn.

183
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,999
And the only theory
I'm interested in is risk versus votes.

184
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,334
And he gets us the votes.

185
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,297
Didn't you hear the leadership?
They said Conway is destroying us.

186
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,384
Macallan reverses that,
he wins us the election.

187
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,516
"ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."

188
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,769
How many of you have heard of ICO?

189
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,315
They're Muslim extremists
taking over oil fields in Syria.

190
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,151
The media is barely covering them

191
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,572
because the White House
is turning a blind eye.

192
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,532
As the Governor of New York...

193
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,993
I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism

194
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,871
because it's been right here
on our doorstep.

195
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,459
You know what I did
when 9/11 happened?

196
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,003
I joined the Air Force
because I wanted to serve my country,

197
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,505
just like my grandfather did

198
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,382
when he boarded a transport ship
on this very dock

199
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,553
and sailed to the Pacific
to fight the Japanese.

200
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,598
When my children grow up...

201
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,226
Charlie and Lily...

202
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,190
I wanna be able to...
to look them in the eye...

203
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,902
and tell them that I fought for you.

204
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,238
I fought for your future.

205
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,408
And to me, that future is clear.

206
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:58,750
Less government, less taxes,
more freedom, protect that freedom!

207
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,465
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

208
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,008
Governor, can you comment

209
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,552
on your relationship with
the search engine Pollyhop?

210
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,515
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you
with voter data?

211
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,894
- I want Grant here, right away.
- Uh, he's in California I think.

212
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,729
He's got two Gulf Streams.
Have him pick one.

213
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,982
Thank you so much, thank you.
Thank you, take care.

214
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,943
<i>Is it true
Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?</i>

215
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,362
- The question was caught on camera.
- Did he answer it?

216
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,158
No. It's getting a lot of traction online.
Should be all over the news by morning.

217
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,869
Have Seth send me
all the stories and clips so far.

218
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,872
I don't think I have to meet
LeAnn's guy now.

219
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,999
- Plan A's gonna work.
- No, no, no.

220
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,544
Meet with him.
Look, it doesn't commit us to anything.

221
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,045
- Sir--
- Look, I don't wanna go down this route

222
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,631
any more than you do,
but at least we'll have our bases covered.

223
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,716
Yes, sir.

224
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,350
Imagine a duel.
Me and Conway.

225
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,397
Now, Conway has a powerful gun,
a search engine.

226
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,778
And it's powerful because with it,
he can tell what you think, what you want,

227
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,531
where you are and who you are.

228
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,908
He can turn all those searches into votes,

229
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,078
and that's enough bullets
to kill my chances of winning.

230
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,791
But I have an even bigger gun.
It's called the NSA.

231
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,626
It's one of the perks of being president.

232
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,129
That is, if the courts allow
my surveillance request.

233
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,175
I imagine the men hanging on these walls

234
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,886
wished they'd had a gun like that
available to them.

235
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,932
Your phone, the phone of the person
sitting next to you,

236
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,809
your neighbor's phone
and everyone you know

237
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,770
and the 300 million Americans
you don't know.

238
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:49,611
I can see you, and I can use
what I see to rig this election.

239
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,656
Now, of course, a weapon like that,
well, you can imagine how risky it is.

240
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,533
Huh, it might have even given pause
to an old crook like him.

241
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,494
I mean, they roasted him on the spit

242
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,872
for tapping into a few rooms
at the Watergate.

243
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,876
I'm talking about tapping into
every single home in America.

244
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,379
And a weapon like that
could blow up in my hand

245
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,842
and that's why it's plan B.
Plan A is much safer.

246
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,137
Expose that Conway
is using his gun illegally

247
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,681
and remove the weapon from his hand.

248
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,815
Hmm...
All three of us took bullets.

249
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,778
Well, I know why we're smiling.
We survived.

250
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,712
Aidan.
This is Doug Stamper.

251
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,922
Yeah, I know who he is.

252
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,632
Tell me why I'm here.

253
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,345
Domestic surveillance.
We need to win an election.

254
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,814
- You serious?
- What if we were?

255
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,234
The NSA...

256
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,572
- You'd take that risk?
- If you can be trusted.

257
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:04,078
Every theory you have ever had,
everything you have ever wanted to test.

258
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:09,375
And in return, you get what?
Voter data? So you know who to target?

259
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,794
And how to target them, to influence them.

260
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,462
To brainwash them?

261
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,259
Oh, this is about Conway,
the Pollyhop thing.

262
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,178
- I never should've told you that.
- Are we wasting our time?

263
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,307
I couldn't put a single person on this.

264
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,727
- No. It's radioactive.
- We're done.

265
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,729
- This is over.
- How would this even work?

266
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,522
To get backbone access requires--

267
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,025
We're getting a FISA ruling,
counter-terrorism.

268
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,526
I've never won
a bid from the NSA--

269
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,403
- LeAnn, let's go.
- You'd win the bid.

270
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,782
This is what you want, Aidan.

271
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,785
Jesus.

272
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,420
You came here to see if you can trust me.
How do I know I can trust you?

273
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,550
I don't care whether you trust me or not.

274
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:04,388
But if we go down this road,
you take the fall if anything goes wrong.

275
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,558
Not us, not the president.
You.

276
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,896
It's the only way this works.
So you tell me if you think it's worth it.

277
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,149
The worth.

278
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,322
You have no idea.

279
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,991
Thank you so much for coming.

280
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,993
- Jeffrey!
- Governor.

281
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,204
How you doing?
Thank you so much.

282
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,165
Buying a whole table.
I mean, you've just been so great to us.

283
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,375
Anything for you, Governor.
Can I get a photo?

284
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,626
Of course.

285
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,672
How you doing, Rich?

286
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:43,469
- Is this, uh, Pollyhop thing true?
- Let's get Hannah in this. Hannah.

287
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,639
- Oh, Jeff.
- Hannah, good to see you.

288
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,016
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Mr. Grant is here.

289
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,184
I'm good, how are you?

290
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,186
Jeffrey, I'm gonna come find you, okay?
I'll be right back.

291
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,855
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

292
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,982
I'm getting calls from <i>The New York Times.</i>

293
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,192
There is no way
we can keep a lid on this now.

294
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,443
We're getting calls from everyone.

295
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,447
If the media really digs their feet in,
forget about the public response.

296
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,032
We need to worry about
the Justice Department.

297
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,952
You said
what we're doing wasn't illegal.

298
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,204
No, I said it was gray,
that it's unregulated.

299
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,414
Our data is proprietary.

300
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,166
How we want to use it,
it's our prerogative.

301
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,336
If they put a value on the benefits
of sharing all that data,

302
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,631
the figure would break
all campaign finance caps there are.

303
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,133
How the fuck did this get out?

304
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,677
Sir? That reporter's not
in our press pool.

305
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,430
- We didn't credential him ourselves.
- So, who does he work for?

306
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,141
We're still trying to track that down.

307
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,768
Give me your phone.

308
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>I'll connect you now, sir.
You are now on with the president.</i>

309
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,152
<i>I must say, I'm disappointed.</i>

310
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,071
<i>I was hoping the first time
we met would be in person.</i>

311
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,823
- We've met before.
<i>- Oh, yes, that's right.</i>

312
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,910
<i>You know why I'm calling, Mr. President.</i>

313
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,913
No, but I have been reading
some curious articles.

314
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,082
How long before you think
it becomes mainstream?

315
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,833
<i>You planted that reporter.</i>

316
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,504
I did not. You're giving me
far more credit than I deserve.

317
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,174
If you bring
the Justice Department into this,

318
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,426
I'll come down hard on you
for abuse of power,

319
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,970
and that'll hurt you
just as much as it hurts me.

320
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,223
<i>I won't have to. They read the newspapers,
just like everyone else.</i>

321
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,767
Well, then you better hold them back.

322
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,646
<i>Let me remind you, Governor,
in case you do become president one day,</i>

323
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,856
the Justice Department is autonomous.

324
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,943
If I were to intervene,
it would be illegal.

325
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,111
<i>Just like when you raided FEMA?</i>

326
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,613
<i>See, the country wants to believe
that you're corrupt,</i>

327
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,950
<i>and I'll draw a very clear line
between you--</i>

328
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,243
Go ahead.
The more volume on this, the better.

329
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,081
You hurl accusations,
I'll let the press hurl facts.

330
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:40,169
<i>But what did you really hope to achieve?
I think you've wasted your time.</i>

331
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,005
<i>You should have called me
when you had some actual leverage.</i>

332
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,924
<i>But I must say,
it is a treat to hear you so worked up.</i>

333
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,384
<i>I do thank you for that.</i>

334
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,721
"Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.

335
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,141
<i>Tall men make good presidents."
You said that when we first met.</i>

336
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,268
Yes, I remember what I said.

337
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,146
<i>You were intimidated.</i>

338
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,025
I don't underestimate you, Governor.
But intimidated?

339
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,238
<i>Takes a lot more than height and arrogance
to intimidate me.</i>

340
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,115
<i>You better get back to all your lawyers.</i>

341
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,415
When the Roman general Sulla,
who was about the same age I am now,

342
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,585
marched on Rome
to purge the city of usurpers,

343
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,254
it was a bloodbath.

344
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,173
His greatest rival
was a young man named Marius,

345
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,300
who was just 26 years old.

346
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,968
And after Sulla had him killed,

347
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:34,515
he held up his head in the forum
and looked into the boy's dead eyes

348
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,601
and said,
"First, you must learn to pull an oar.

349
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,229
Only then can you take the helm."

350
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,529
Hmm. 110 over 80.
Not bad.

351
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,657
- Will.
- Hey.

352
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,204
Hey.

353
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:01,250
I called the president.

354
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,503
It was a mistake.

355
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,880
- Okay.
- Mmm.

356
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:14,638
Look, um...
why don't we go back upstairs

357
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,390
and collect some money?

358
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,810
Okay?
Everyone wants to see you.

359
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,072
- Let's go.
- You'll figure it out.

360
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,128
Conway called.
He wanted to make a deal.

361
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,964
I'm sure that was enjoyable.

362
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,093
It will be even more so once
the Justice Department gets involved.

363
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,638
Is that the, uh...

364
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,641
Same model.
Not the actual one.

365
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:10,068
- Surprised the Secret Service let--
- Well, they removed the firing pin.

366
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,613
It's lighter than I imagined.

367
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,243
It's amazing something this small
could do that much damage.

368
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,707
I was gonna bring it tomorrow,
but I think it might be too theatrical.

369
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,346
You want me to help you practice?

370
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,724
All right.

371
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,937
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

372
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,357
Good morning, Ms. Melman.

373
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,901
- No, what's her first name?
- Julia.

374
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,570
- Use that.
- We've never met before.

375
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,114
Remind her who the First Lady is.

376
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,162
Good morning, Julia.

377
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,122
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

378
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,624
Please, have a seat.

379
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,924
We want to be inclusive.
We'd like the NRA to work with us

380
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,467
on getting this bill passed.

381
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,554
We have major support
on both sides of the aisle.

382
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,056
Well, you do for now,
but not for long.

383
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,850
You can have 20 kids massacred
in a school shooting.

384
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,895
There's always the usual public outcry,
demands for gun reform.

385
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,398
But a few months go by
and people forget.

386
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,192
Well, this will move
through Congress quickly.

387
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,985
We've got major support
on both sides of the aisle.

388
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,696
Not enough to break a filibuster.

389
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,989
<i>We'll drag this out
till the election.</i>

390
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,116
We'll tie up every other bill
in the Senate.

391
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,827
Well, I've spoken
to a lot of Senators and they--

392
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,496
No, don't get bogged down there.
Pivot right to the Supreme Court.

393
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,541
You plan on holding up
the Supreme Court nomination, as well?

394
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,751
Unless you're going to nominate
an NRA member.

395
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,629
- You know we can't do that.
- Jacobs was unpredictable.

396
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,506
This time we're not taking any chances.

397
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,425
If you bring the government
to a standstill,

398
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,594
we're gonna make this election
about the NRA.

399
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,305
You can't match $100 million in ad buys.

400
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,349
Go for it.
Flush your money down the drain.

401
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,393
The Democrats lost that battle
decades ago.

402
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>And you'll lose it again.</i>

403
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,982
The president never offered up
one gun reform bill while he was whip.

404
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,692
Well, because it wasn't
a top priority for him--

405
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,777
No, no, no, no, no.
Make it, uh, stronger.

406
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,448
Say, uh, "The president took a bullet!"
Make it personal.

407
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,576
I'm sorry your husband got shot.
But not enough to roll over.

408
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,870
Oh, we're not asking you to.

409
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,873
We're inviting you
to be on the right side of history.

410
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,709
Yeah, that's good,
but you wanna go in for the kill.

411
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,086
We want this woman
storming out of that door,

412
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,338
foaming at the mouth.

413
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,590
All right.
Don't disgrace yourself, Julia.

414
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,467
- Think about the future--
- No, tougher.

415
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,926
Stronger, tougher!

416
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,722
All right, what about...

417
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,933
Thirty years from now
when you're dying in hospice care...

418
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,854
you can look back
and be proud of all the lives you saved.

419
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,857
Or you can be forgotten...

420
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,693
clutching onto the past
with your cold, dead hands.

421
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,612
I'll show myself out.

422
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,366
That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach
I was talking about.

423
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,867
Was it Pete Dreyer?

424
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,745
<i>Congressman Dreyer's
been a mentor for years.</i>

425
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,998
- He had no right to tell you.
- He had every right.

426
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,708
If a member
of the House Intelligence Committee

427
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,211
chooses to share information with me,
he's at liberty to do so.

428
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,838
<i>Our conversation
was in confidence.</i>

429
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,507
<i>I don't feel comfortable with this.</i>

430
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,926
The Congressman
is just as frustrated as you are,

431
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,554
and he spoke to me
because he wants to help.

432
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,264
And so do I, General.

433
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,891
<i>Governor, I'm a soldier.
I'm not going to play politics.</i>

434
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,813
You played politics the moment
you opened your mouth to Pete.

435
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,320
<i>- Did you see my speech yesterday?</i>
- Yes, I did.

436
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,071
<i>I meant every word of it.</i>

437
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,532
<i>Now, you and I have
both fought for our country.</i>

438
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,158
Underwood hasn't.

439
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,412
He has no idea.
He doesn't understand.

440
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,501
And that's why I need to be president,
so we can strike when we need to strike.

441
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:58,422
<i>Look, I can help you,
but I need your help to do so.</i>

442
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,760
I've never leaked classified information
to the press. Not once.

443
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,513
My colleagues have. I haven't.

444
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,181
<i>There's a better way.</i>

445
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>You're not gonna like
the sound of this at first,</i>

446
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:14,270
<i>but if you hear me out,
we can fight back on this.</i>

447
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,939
- General.
- Mr. President.

448
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,530
You can take this back.
I am not accepting your resignation.

449
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,865
Please, sit.

450
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,327
I fought in Lebanon, sir.

451
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,706
Commanded troops in Somalia, in Bosnia,
in both Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan.

452
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,876
I just don't wanna see us bogged down
in another conflict like those.

453
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,087
ICO is the next Al Qaeda and Taliban.

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,466
And you accomplish nothing
by resigning your commission.

455
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,761
We've accomplished nothing
with your current policy.

456
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,014
You know,
I just can't help but think that...

457
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,018
the timing of this,
it's just a bit coincidental.

458
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,438
- Sir?
- Well, Conway gave a big speech yesterday.

459
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:59,315
I mean, he made a big meal out of ICO,
didn't he?

460
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,444
I suppose he realizes
just how dangerous they are.

461
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,656
Hmm. I wonder where
he's getting that information.

462
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,323
I've no idea, sir.

463
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:11,036
I've never spoken to the man, nor would I.
It's classified.

464
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,497
And you're speaking from your conscience.

465
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,625
Yes, sir.

466
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,420
Conscience has
an unmistakable stink to it,

467
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,130
sort of like raw onions
and morning breath.

468
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,508
But a lie stinks even more

469
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,760
when it's coming from someone
who isn't used to lying.

470
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,846
It's more like rotten eggs and horseshit.

471
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,770
- How soon can we move on this?
- You want to conduct the mission?

472
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,480
Would it keep you from resigning?

473
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,524
Well, I--

474
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:45,195
I need your expertise and your experience,
and if both are telling me I'm wrong,

475
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,656
I'd rather trust your instincts than mine.

476
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,200
Do we still have an open window?

477
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,496
The gathering is set to end
by tomorrow night.

478
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,582
Let me talk to the Chairman
and the Secretary of Defense

479
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,292
- before I sign off on the order.
- Of course, sir.

480
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,548
General, it takes a brave man
to stand up to a president.

481
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,759
If you authorize the mission,
we won't get our court ruling.

482
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,638
There is no way to justify domestic
surveillance once ICO is eliminated.

483
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,433
Which is fine,
because media pressure is mounting.

484
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,893
Conway has no choice
but to distance himself from Pollyhop.

485
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,145
We don't know how that's gonna play out.

486
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,065
Oh, I can tell you how Brockhart's
resignation is gonna play out.

487
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,735
Thirty-second ads in every swing state.

488
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,489
A decorated war veteran pulverizing us
for being weak on national security.

489
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,700
Pollyhop is gonna pulverize us more
than Brockhart ever could.

490
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,910
Not if Conway is busy
fighting public outcry.

491
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,912
Think about the data
they have already gathered.

492
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,874
When you sold us this,
you said it was going to be a last resort,

493
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,083
not the only resort.

494
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,043
There is no risk
in getting surveillance approved.

495
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,754
Then we either use it or we don't.

496
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,632
But if you order this strike, sir,
we don't even have the option.

497
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,385
- You've met with him, Macallan.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,929
- So, can he be trusted?
- I honestly can't say.

499
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,682
He understands the risks
even better than you do.

500
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,563
- I'm gonna authorize the strike.
- Sir...

501
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,691
- Your guy's an unknown. Brockhart isn't.
- Ma'am...

502
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,278
- I agree with Francis.
- Get me the Secretary of Defense.

503
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,323
I've asked Claire to join us today

504
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,409
because this directly affects
the legislation

505
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,952
she's trying to get passed.

506
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:19,706
Your top three choices for running mate,
they're all tight with the gun lobby.

507
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,957
Mrs. Underwood...

508
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,503
You know everyone in this room
agrees with the reforms you want,

509
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,713
but we're thinking about
the general election,

510
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,216
and the NRA is a terrible enemy
for us to make.

511
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,554
Yeah, now Whittaker's gonna focus
on swing states, fundraising...

512
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,221
That's where I'll play the bad cop.

513
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,642
You play the worse cop.
Then when we get them off balance...

514
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,061
You come back in again as the good cop.

515
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,438
Exactly.
So I will start with...

516
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,650
Well, I feel that these choices
send mixed messages.

517
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,527
We're for gun reform, they're not.

518
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,156
If both names on the ticket
are gun-control fanatics,

519
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,033
then the whole election becomes about...

520
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,327
Get personal,
the way you told me to with Melman.

521
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,663
One out of four presidents gets shot at.

522
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,457
One out of every ten
dies from a bullet wound.

523
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,084
Better than that.

524
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,087
I saw Edward Meechum die
before my very eyes.

525
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,756
- Good. You were lucky.
- I'm lucky.

526
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,300
Statistics don't mean
anything to these people.

527
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,178
They see this as a one-way road
to confiscation.

528
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,388
I lose my seat in a heartbeat
if I take this stance.

529
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,602
- Now, this is where I will play good cop.
- Okay, so Birch goes,

530
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,521
"We're asking you to look at the bigger
picture here, Mr. President."

531
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,065
You're right, Bob.

532
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,943
- Claire!
- They're all right. They are.

533
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,904
My meeting with the NRA did not go well.

534
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,280
They're going to fight this
tooth and nail.

535
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,616
Well, of course they are.

536
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,619
And... and the chances are
the legislation won't pass.

537
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,954
Oh, it'll pass.
Because you are going to push it

538
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,915
until it goes through both houses
and gets on the books.

539
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,208
We may have support now...

540
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,128
But by the time
this bill gets onto the floor...

541
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,422
You focus on the language, Congressman.

542
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,009
Leave convincing
the American people to us.

543
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,969
Now, if you wanna
work with us on this bill,

544
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,014
I can stomach a gun-friendly candidate.

545
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,515
What about you, Francis?

546
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,101
The kill.

547
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,813
Only on one condition, Claire.
I don't want us to work our asses off

548
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:10,358
getting this bill passed just to see it
knocked down in the courts.

549
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,737
- We don't have any control over that, sir.
- We still need to fill Jacobs' seat.

550
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,784
If you can confirm an anti-gun justice,
I'll put a gun-lover on the ticket.

551
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,788
A Supreme Court confirmation
in the middle of an election?

552
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,080
Oh, come on, grow a pair, Bob.

553
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,041
We're giving you what you want.
Give us what we want.

554
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,420
Who are you thinking about?

555
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,758
Nobody followed you?

556
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,886
No one.
I'm positive.

557
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,350
You know, sometimes
I have a student and something seems off.

558
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,021
They look a little too old, you know?
To be in college.

559
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,946
- What is that?
- Xanax.

560
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,582
Lucas came up here.

561
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,585
To the campus.

562
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,091
He wanted my help and I said no.

563
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,763
Maybe if I had, he wouldn't have...

564
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,517
So stupid.

565
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,771
He got out.

566
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,274
Why did he do this?

567
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,029
That's what I'm trying to find out.

568
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,038
It's all true, Tom.

569
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,750
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

570
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,714
Lucas didn't mention you
in his suicide letter.

571
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,758
I'm sure it was to protect me.

572
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,179
If you have any proof,
now's the time to share it.

573
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,099
If I did, do you think
any of this would've happened?

574
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,439
- You could go on record--
- I signed an affidavit.

575
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,526
Anything I say now is worth shit.

576
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,947
That's probably why they've left me alone.

577
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,622
No, no. No.
No more pills.

578
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,459
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

579
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,962
I would help if I could, I--

580
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,965
You just focus on taking care of yourself.

581
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,266
Come here. Come here.

582
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,440
Is there anything I can do
to make you reconsider?

583
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,986
Yes, sir, I understand.
I'm pleased the strike's on, as well.

584
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,197
Thank you for the heads up.
Bye.

585
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,532
Fuck!

586
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,827
- What's wrong?
- He caved.

587
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,744
- The general?
- Yes.

588
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,663
Daddy, when is it?

589
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,000
When is it?
Ben?

590
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,337
I'm not sure about this, Will.
Maybe we should cancel it.

591
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,047
My lawyers are saying
it's a terrible idea.

592
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,132
If it's not us,
it's the Justice Department.

593
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,928
- I've put everything into this company.
- Just trust me on this.

594
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,972
- Hey, Will.
- Mmm-hmm?

595
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,473
- For my Insta.
- Yeah.

596
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,266
Okay.
Smile, Charlie.

597
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,102
Smile.

598
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,395
- All right.
- Great.

599
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,314
Here we go.

600
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,400
You little...

601
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,737
Scoot over.

602
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,864
Are we all set?

603
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,200
Yes, sir.
Ready whenever you are.

604
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,119
Here we go.

605
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,333
Okay.

606
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,709
You ready? You ready?

607
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,503
Yep.

608
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,297
Here we go.

609
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:05,718
Hello, America. I'm Will Conway,
Republican candidate for president,

610
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,764
and this is my son, Charlie.
You wanna say hi to everyone, Charlie?

611
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,308
A little hi. Can we get a little hi?

612
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,185
No? That's all we get?
That's all we get.

613
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:19,565
And this is Hannah, my wife.
And our little rascal Lily.

614
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,402
Well, she's not so little anymore,

615
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,529
but definitely still a rascal.

616
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,031
Aren't you, sweetheart?

617
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,910
And we are webcasting
from our home here in Albany.

618
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,454
As you can see, we don't live
in the governor's mansion.

619
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,374
We live in a regular house,
just like many of you.

620
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:41,462
And this is our living room.
Hannah has decorated everything herself.

621
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,924
Well, except for the toys.

622
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,301
That's the...
That's the kids' addition to the decor.

623
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,428
A lot of toys.

624
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,140
Now, many of you have seen
or read in the news

625
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,769
rumors about my campaign teaming up
with the search engine Pollyhop,

626
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,189
and I'd like to speak to you today
about those rumors

627
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,232
because they're not rumors at all.

628
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,152
They're facts.
One hundred percent accurate.

629
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,198
And here is my good friend Benjamin Grant.
He's the founder of Pollyhop,

630
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,951
and he's gonna tell you
about our partnership.

631
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,454
Well, a lot of big companies
stay out of politics.

632
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,041
They don't want to offend anyone.
But not Pollyhop.

633
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,295
We're not shy about who we support,
and we're proud to support Will Conway.

634
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,340
He knows what this country needs
and where it's going.

635
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,719
Now...

636
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,431
I realize this might scare
a lot of people.

637
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,269
Do we know your personal information?
Can we see what you're searching for?

638
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,730
Are we reading your emails?

639
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,900
The answer is no.
We're not tracking individuals.

640
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,527
We're looking at metadata,

641
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:51,574
large-scale browsing patterns,
search trends, regional portraits.

642
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,868
'Cause Ben is right.

643
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,247
A president should know his constituents.

644
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,915
And the Internet
is the best tool for that.

645
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,087
Now, I've met thousands of people
and shaken a lot of hands,

646
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,881
but I can't meet everyone.

647
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,926
So this is my way of listening
to millions of you.

648
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:15,015
Now, it's only fair
if I get to know you better,

649
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,724
you should get to know me better.

650
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,811
So while I'm not reading
your personal correspondence,

651
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,855
I want you to have access to mine.

652
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:27,818
So, from this point forward, every email,
text message, photo, or video

653
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,487
that I use on this phone,

654
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,782
you can see it all, including everything
since I became governor.

655
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,997
Now, all you have to do
is go into my campaign website at...

656
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,707
Conway2016.com.

657
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,170
That's correct.
And you'll find a link right there.

658
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,089
Our life is your life.

659
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:51,384
And your future is our future.

660
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,845
Thank you, and God bless America.

661
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,851
- That was good.
- Yeah, that was good.

662
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,146
Well done. Well done.

663
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,480
You got it, Governor.

664
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,941
All right. Now we wait and see.

665
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,360
His honesty and openness
have made quite an impact,

666
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,986
and America is paying attention.

667
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,489
Just three hours since Conway's webcast,

668
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,034
over two million people
have visited his website...

669
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:20,246
The massive public interest
has driven traffic to Pollyhop.com.

670
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,501
Pollyhop CEO Benjamin Grant is reporting
three times its normal volume of searches.

671
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,338
All of the cell phone footage
is on the Conway campaign website.

672
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,005
There's a ton of archived clips.

673
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,051
Some have already gone viral,
including this one,

674
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:37,638
filmed just this morning, of Conway
with his gorgeous wife Hannah, so jealous,

675
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,849
and his totally adorable son Charlie.

676
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,685
Whee!

677
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,149
- Shave Mom's head, not mine!
- Shave Mom's head?

678
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,400
- Okay.
- No!

679
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,112
You guessed it.
I still hate children.

680
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,786
People don't care about their privacy.
They want him to have access.

681
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,038
He's still breaking
campaign finance regulations.

682
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:06,251
But he's getting good press,
not the public outcry we had hoped for.

683
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,253
You can't let
the Justice Department investigate.

684
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,795
It'll backfire on us.

685
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,006
What you need to do
is call off the air strike.

686
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,717
Sir, you've already signed the order.
We've got planes in the air.

687
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,844
My job is to win a campaign,
I need to have--

688
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,639
- And my job is to protect the president.
- Enough!

689
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,978
Jesus Christ.

690
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,359
Go. I need to speak with him.

691
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,496
What are you thinking?

692
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,167
That I was fine with this
when it was just plan B,

693
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,253
but this is...
domestic surveillance.

694
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,422
I mean, we don't even know this guy.

695
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,717
You're right, we don't know him.
What we do know...

696
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,887
is we'll lose if we do nothing.

697
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,726
They're beautiful, aren't they?
The Conways.

698
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,815
Their youth, their two little children.

699
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,234
The country is falling in love with them.

700
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,783
They won't fall in love with us like that,
but we have something they don't.

701
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:27,373
We are willing to go one step farther
than everyone else.

702
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,632
General, a word.

703
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,261
We're approximately
two hours out--

704
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,804
- Abort the mission.
- Mr. President?

705
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,265
- I'm ordering you to abort.
- But you said--

706
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,310
Don't make me say it a third time,
and don't threaten to resign,

707
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,644
because I know you won't,

708
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,981
because you can't even fathom
what it means to be a civilian.

709
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,191
- Execute my order.
- Yes, sir.

710
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,986
- Sir.
- It's done.

711
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,696
- Sir.
- I aborted.

712
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,401
You're up late.

713
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:40,696
<i>Go to Conway's website.
December 31st, 2012.</i>

714
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,664
<i>Hannah's last moments of 2012.</i>

715
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,333
<i>Oh.</i>

716
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,209
<i>Stop, I'm stuffing my face.</i>

717
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,297
<i>You're feeding a growing girl.
Hello, little baby.</i>

718
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,090
<i>Mmm.
Yes, I am.</i>

719
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,593
<i>She's kicking like a maniac, too.
Will, please, stop.</i>

720
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,719
<i>- No, come on.
- No.</i>

721
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,638
<i>You've got... You have...
You have a little something...</i>

722
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,348
<i>Mr. Governor-elect.</i>

723
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,810
Congressman, such an honor to meet you.

724
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,228
- Well, the honor is mine.
- This is my wife, Hannah.

725
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,022
It's a pleasure.
And this is Claire.

726
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,231
Hello.

727
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,776
- Oh, wow. How far along are you?
- Almost seven months.

728
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,947
Thank you so much for inviting us here.
This is a real treat for us.

729
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,783
Well, I'm glad you came. I thought
you'd be in Times Square tonight.

730
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,202
It's Governor De Luca's
last year in office.

731
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,079
I thought he should have
the spotlight to himself.

732
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,539
Well, that's very classy of you.

733
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,500
And I didn't wanna miss the chance
to make some new friends in Washington.

734
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,670
Well, that was a smart idea.
Have you met Garrett, yet?

735
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,796
No. No, sir.

736
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,048
Well, come on.
Ladies, we'll be back.

737
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:53,102
Mr. President-elect,
Governor-elect Conway.

738
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,355
- Congratulations.
- You, too, sir.

739
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,899
So here he is, the boy wonder.
He isn't a myth after all.

740
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,818
More like a pariah.

741
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,780
- There's a lot of Democrats here.
- Plenty of Republicans, too.

742
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,073
Frank made sure of that.

743
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,409
Well, if you wanna push the sludge
through Congress,

744
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,620
it's best to have grease
on both sides of the aisle.

745
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,749
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go.
It's almost time.

746
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,710
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you, sir.

747
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,884
So, is it true that you joined up
a day after 9/11,

748
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,594
or is that just something you say?

749
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,890
- Within 24 hours, honest to God.
- That's incredible.

750
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:35,060
Hey... I was 25, just out of law school.

751
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:40,525
You want a career in politics
and the Twin Towers fall in your lap?

752
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,360
Timing couldn't have been better.

753
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:47,364
Oh, I see how you won.

754
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:53,413
- Well, he must be on top of the world.
- I... I can't imagine.

755
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,206
Oh, really?
How old are you? Thirty-five?

756
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,291
Thirty-six.

757
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,834
Oh, you've never thought about it,
late at night?

758
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,336
- The White House?
- What else?

759
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,464
- Have you?
- Haven't we all?

760
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:10,680
I'm in no rush.
Who knows? Maybe, one day.

761
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:16,852
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.
Tall men make great presidents.

762
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,063
It's like you want me to run.

763
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,606
Oh, goodness, no.
You running?

764
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,692
That would be a disaster
for the Democrats.

765
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,986
- I better see my wife.
- Ten...

766
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,196
- Me, too.
- ...nine,

767
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:32,201
eight, seven, six, five, four,

768
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,329
three, two, one!

769
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,875
Happy New Year!

770
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,887
- That was before everything.
<i>- I know.</i>

771
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,613
Francis, are you there?

772
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,630
We're going to destroy them.

773
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,673
Yes, we are.
