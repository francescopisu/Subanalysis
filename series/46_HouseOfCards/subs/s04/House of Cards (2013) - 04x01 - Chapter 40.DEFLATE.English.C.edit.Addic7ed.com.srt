00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>Mayda slides her fingers in...</i>

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>all the way up to her...
her wedding ring.</i>

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,019
She pushes you onto your back
and leans down.

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:24,692
Puts the fingers into your mouth
so you can... taste them.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,029
The gold of the ring...

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,368
You could taste the sting
of the metal on your tongue...

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,249
mixed with the taste of her cunt.

8
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,713
She leans down,
whispers in your ear,

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,591
"I love you, Gagik. Ah.

10
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,842
I love you."

11
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,178
- I'm close, man.
- She straddles you, pulls you inside...

12
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,725
grinds her hips back and forth,
back and forth--

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,905
Ah, damn, you're good with words.

"...New Hampshire for over 200 years.

16
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,219
There've been ups and downs
along the way.

17
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,638
Like the big A-mos-ke-ag."

18
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,100
Am... Amos--

19
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
Do you have her?

20
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,105
She won't get on the phone.

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,690
- Then get her detail on the phone.
- I did.

22
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,944
They can't force her to talk to you, sir.

23
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,531
We need to think about what to say
when I show up at this event

24
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,783
and she's not with me.

25
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,285
And I don't want to make it worse
by mispronouncing this.

26
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,453
How do you say this word?

27
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,705
They didn't put in the goddamn phonetics
in this speech!

28
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,751
And I can't be expected
to look this shit up myself!

29
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,378
I'll find out for you, sir.

30
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>And of course, there's been...</i>

31
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,808
"...ups and downs along the way."

32
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:49,146
Like the big Amoskeag strike
in the 1920s over pay and hours.

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,732
But this industry survived that as well.

34
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,696
And all of you in this room
have been carrying on a tradition

35
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,283
that goes back
to the beginning of this country,

36
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,119
and that's something you have to be
very, very proud of!

37
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,250
"But there's another tradition
in this state:

38
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,294
Live Free or Die.

39
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,921
Now, my wife--"

40
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,069
There's another tradition in this state:

41
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,696
Live Free or Die.

42
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,949
Live Free or Die.

43
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,665
Now, of course, as some of you
may read in the papers,

44
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,085
and, uh, hear from the television pundits

45
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,130
that my opponent has a ten-point lead
here in New Hampshire.

46
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,298
But...

47
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,138
you're not gonna let polls and pundits
tell you what to do.

48
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,267
- No!
- Or tell you how to vote on Election Day.

49
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,814
You are gonna show them that
New Hampshire makes up its own mind.

50
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,652
Thank you! Thank you all
for coming out today.

51
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,030
And God bless America.
Thank you.

52
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,871
Underwood!
Underwood! Underwood!

53
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,788
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

54
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,125
Thank you all.
Thank you all very much.

55
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,168
Thank you.

56
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,379
She landed in Dallas ten minutes ago.

57
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,756
Our story is she's down there
laying groundwork for the primary.

58
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,883
That only gives us a day or two.

59
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,218
If she's not doing events,
they'll think we're hiding something.

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,427
You think she'll stay put
on the ranch?

61
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,014
I have no idea.
You keep track of all of her movements.

62
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,556
Visitors, names, times,

63
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,350
the color of their shit
and how much it stinks.

64
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,519
- Yes, sir.
- And I want you on a plane.

65
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,313
- Back to Washington?
- Down to Texas.

66
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,629
- Where is she?
- The master bedroom.

67
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,408
Mrs. Hale mentioned
that she might take a nap.

68
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,705
- Is my room made up?
- It's being dusted right now.

69
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,625
- I'd like to take a look.
- Yes, ma'am.

70
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,094
Well, Texas is an important state.

71
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,680
Nearly 10% of the delegates
we need for the nomination.

72
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,807
But you said the First Lady
would be here with you today.

73
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,725
Yes, well, when we assessed
things this morning,

74
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,019
we felt good about New Hampshire.

75
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,438
I mean, look at this crowd,
the enthusiasm.

76
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,606
Hello, hello.
Oh, my goodness.

77
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,650
Hello there, aren't you a cutie?
What's your name?

78
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,277
- Gabby.
- Hello, Gabby.

79
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,112
Anyway, we wanted
to start looking ahead.

80
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,781
Claire's from Texas, so it made sense
for her to head down there early.

81
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,451
Hello. Hello.
Thank you for coming out. Hi.

82
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,786
I can't do my job
if you keep me in the dark.

83
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,539
<i>All you need to know
is what you put out in the statement.</i>

84
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,707
- Was it an argument?
<i>- Seth.</i>

85
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,501
Look, I'm working 20 hours a day here
on a normal day

86
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,420
with the campaign in full swing,
and now this is on my plate?

87
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,049
Look, I can do damage control,
but I have to know what the damage is.

88
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,468
Okay. I'll fill you in.
Let me get up to my room.

89
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,387
Welcome to Dallas.

90
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,306
Or maybe it's a decoy,

91
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,516
trying to lure us into making
ad-buys in Texas.

92
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,852
That would explain
why it wasn't part of her schedule.

93
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,730
- Have you spoken to our friends in Dallas?
- No meetings or calls.

94
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,690
If she were making the rounds,
we'd know.

95
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,692
Well, they're either excellent
at covering their tracks,

96
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,026
or something's up.

97
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,446
- Like what?
- I don't know, but I wanna find out.

98
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,621
She's gonna fucking leave me.
My kid in her belly.

99
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,749
And she gonna act like I never existed.

100
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,169
Probably pawned the wedding ring already.

101
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,219
- How many is that?
- Two more.

102
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,395
- Can you blame her, though?
- Yeah, I can blame her.

103
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,897
I gave her everything.
She gonna rob me of my kid?

104
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,900
He's gonna be in high school
before you're out.

105
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,235
I'll still be his fucking father.

106
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,654
You gotta let them move on, man.

107
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,282
- It's unfair not to.
- Let me tell you about unfair.

108
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,284
Okay? Unfair is I'm even in here,

109
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,161
and that fucking bitch
doesn't even know it.

110
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,163
She thinks I belong in this shithole?

111
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,294
You did kill a guy.

112
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,008
- Are you saying you didn't?
- I didn't say shit.

113
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,010
Because I...

114
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,512
I had my doubts.

115
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,141
What do you mean your doubts?

116
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,809
- Hmm?
- Just...

117
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,394
never struck me as a killer, that's all.

118
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,566
You don't know what I am!

119
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,320
Come on!

120
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,238
Let up! I can't breathe.

121
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,209
All I'm saying is...

122
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,337
I interviewed a lot of murder suspects

123
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,255
when I was on the crime beat.

124
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,052
I think you're innocent.

125
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,640
I think you didn't do it.

126
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,232
These guys, they'll skin you alive.

127
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,984
Make you watch in a mirror
while they do it.

128
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,110
What guys?

129
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,031
You ever hear of Armenian Power in LA?

130
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,702
- No.
- Their top guy.

131
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,375
No way that motherfucker
was going to jail, huh?

132
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,627
I didn't have a choice.

133
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>So, you didn't do it?</i>

134
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,800
<i>It doesn't matter
what I did or what I didn't do.</i>

135
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,178
<i>It matters what I said I did.</i>

136
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,473
<i>Who did you take the fall for?</i>

137
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>A national</i> Wall Street Telegraph <i>poll</i>
<i>finds Governor Conway</i>

138
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,543
<i>leading the Republican field with 48%
of GOP primary voters saying</i>

139
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,961
<i>he's their first choice,</i>

140
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,507
<i>over 20% more
than any other candidate.</i>

141
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,387
<i>Conway has had a dramatic ascent since
he announced his candidacy in May of 2015.</i>

142
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,015
<i>In another</i> Wall Street Telegraph <i>poll</i>
<i>conducted at the time,</i>

143
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,311
<i>he only captured
18% of GOP primary voters.</i>

144
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,270
<i>Many felt that his young age
and his lack of...</i>

145
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,522
Meechum!

146
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,193
- Yes, sir?
- Claire's clothes are here.

147
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,320
I'll get Advance.

148
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,612
<i>Along with
his campaign's focus</i>

149
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,325
<i>on his successful tenure as Governor
of New York, his service in the Air...</i>

150
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,868
My apologies, sir.
Her wardrobe shipped last night

151
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,454
and we neglected to adjust.

152
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,205
- All right, just get it out.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,584
<i>Hundreds of supporters lined
up at nearly every one of his Iowa events,</i>

154
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,169
<i>sometimes numbering
in the thousands.</i>

155
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>Prominent in the crowd were
military veterans.</i>

156
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,092
<i>Conway's grandfather was
a Navy chief warrant officer</i>

157
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,845
<i>who fought in the Pacific theater
of World War II.</i>

158
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>- Conway's approach has been likened...</i>
- Meechum.

159
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,142
<i>...to that of John F. Kennedy's
1960 presidential campaign.</i>

160
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>A combination of public charm
and personal poise.</i>

161
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,856
<i>Last week, at a campaign event...</i>

162
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,941
This morning when you
went into her room...

163
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,653
Uh, I told her we were leaving soon.

164
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,821
She just...

165
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,699
She was looking at a photograph...

166
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,160
of the mandala,
the one you gave her.

167
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,288
<i>...event in Manchester,
but without the First Lady.</i>

168
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,832
<i>Reports from
the Underwood administration...</i>

169
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,126
- Good night, sir.
<i>- ...have stated that Claire Underwood...</i>

170
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,837
- Keep me company for a bit.
- Sir?

171
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,840
You just have a seat.
I've got some reading that I have to do.

172
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,593
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,887
<i>But you said the First Lady
would be here with you today.</i>

174
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,722
<i>Yes, well, when we assessed
things this morning,</i>

175
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,140
<i>we felt good about New Hampshire.</i>

176
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,559
<i>I mean, look at this crowd,
the enthusiasm.</i>

177
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,686
<i>Hello, hello.
Oh, my goodness.</i>

178
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>Hello there, aren't you a cutie?
What's your name?</i>

179
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>- Gabby.
- Hello, Gabby.</i>

180
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,150
Oh. Turn that off.

181
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,986
<i>Claire's from Texas, so it made sense
for her to head down there early.</i>

182
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,447
<i>Hello. Hello.
Thank you for coming out. Hi.</i>

183
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,409
"Hmm, aren't you a cutie?"

184
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,890
- What are you doing?
- You fell asleep, sir.

185
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,642
Your glasses, I was...

186
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,228
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to...

187
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,731
- You all right, sir?
- No.

188
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,818
I mean, yes. I'm just...

189
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,112
- Can I get you anything? Some water?
- I'm fine.

190
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,574
It's late.
You should get some sleep.

191
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,741
I'll stay if you like.

192
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,163
I think I'd like to be alone,
but thank you.

193
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,748
Of course, sir.

194
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,729
Watch your step, please.

195
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,242
- LeAnn.
- Mrs. Underwood.

196
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
- Let's take a walk.
- Of course.

197
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,585
You've made the Democrats
relevant again in a very red state.

198
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,295
You want me to help
ramp up the Texas operation?

199
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,798
No, I'm not here for the primary.

200
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm here to run for the 30th,
and I want you to run my campaign.

201
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,054
The White House is saying
that you're here to--

202
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,892
That's just so we don't draw attention
to the congressional race.

203
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,603
Doris Jones, her daughter's running.

204
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,980
The congresswoman
would need to be convinced.

205
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,815
You're saying Celia bows out?

206
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,318
She waits. In two years, the seat is hers.
Four at the most.

207
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,072
- Senate?
- Possibly. Or governor, 2020.

208
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,616
And the president's on board with this?

209
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,992
Completely.

210
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,080
Look, even if you could
convince Celia,

211
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,750
there's still a big problem.

212
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,502
- That I'm white.
- Lily white.

213
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,255
In your designer heels
and tailored dresses, I mean...

214
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,591
look at this property, Mrs. Underwood.

215
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,888
A woman who marched with Dr. King
is not gonna have much patience for...

216
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,015
For what?

217
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,185
An outsider.

218
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,855
Well, I believe we can change
her opinion of me.

219
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,775
Look, I don't mind
betting against the odds.

220
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,695
If I did, I wouldn't be consulting
for Democrats in Texas.

221
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,197
- But what you're asking me--
- When you started your firm, LeAnn,

222
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,491
your father told mine
that you were making a huge mistake.

223
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,493
That's because he was a Republican.

224
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,288
Yes, but you didn't make
a mistake, did you?

225
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,790
You proved him wrong.

226
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,752
Now, a dozen consultants
can tell me why this won't work,

227
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,922
but I think you can tell me why it can.

228
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,137
Meechum said she was in there
for over an hour.

229
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>We don't own Harvey.</i>

230
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,766
Vaughn thinks she's been
holding out for Dunbar.

231
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,102
<i>She wouldn't be meeting
with her about the primary.</i>

232
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,187
Maybe she thinks
she can run for something.

233
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,315
- What? This cycle?
<i>- Elected office has always been her goal.</i>

234
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,694
There aren't any open races.
Not in Texas. Except for Doris Jones.

235
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,238
Yeah, but her daughter's
running for that seat.

236
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,865
<i>She hasn't announced yet.</i>

237
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,867
Which gives Claire an opening.

238
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,835
Hello?

239
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,643
- Hello?
- LeAnn?

240
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,773
Hi.
Doug Stamper.

241
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,817
Wasn't sure if I was in the right--
Wow.

242
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,444
Is that how you say hi in Texas?

243
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,447
Sorry, the elevators are
usually locked down on the weekends.

244
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,200
We've had some burglaries in the building.

245
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,244
- It's nice to meet you, Doug.
- Pleasure.

246
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,413
Mrs. Underwood didn't tell me
you were in town.

247
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,749
I just got in.
President thought it'd be a good idea

248
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,458
if I were here to help
coordinate on the campaign.

249
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,627
Well, I'm not officially on board yet.

250
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,172
I wanted to see how
the meeting goes tomorrow.

251
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,673
The meeting?

252
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,801
Doris Jones.
The First Lady didn't tell you?

253
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,885
No.

254
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,719
Will you excuse me for a moment?

255
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,597
- I just have to make a quick call.
- Of course.

256
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,786
It's the president.

257
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,748
Hello?

258
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,168
<i>Doug tells me
you greeted him with a firearm.</i>

259
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,795
Yeah, we've been
having some issues with--

260
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,130
<i>Do you know what fascinates me
about guns, LeAnn?</i>

261
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,842
You pull a trigger and bang,
a bullet explodes out

262
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,634
faster than the speed of sound.

263
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,220
And if you're on
the wrong end of that bullet,

264
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,473
- why, it hits you before you even hear it.
- Mr. President, forgive me, but--

265
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,851
<i>No, I want you to hear me, LeAnn.</i>

266
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,603
<i>You will walk away
from this nonsense with Claire.</i>

267
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,771
<i>You will not make a phone call
nor answer one.</i>

268
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,983
<i>You will offer no explanation.</i>

269
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,943
Whatever you discussed with my wife,

270
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,529
you will erase it from your mind
and never speak of it again.

271
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
<i>Tell me I've been heard.</i>

272
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,617
Yes, I heard you.

273
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,828
Good.

274
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,792
This is cute.

275
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,754
Put it down, please.

276
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,302
Souvenir.

277
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,975
I'll take that phone, too.

278
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,772
Have a good night.

279
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,945
How soon?

280
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,072
The judge is reviewing
the Rule 35 order now.

281
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,283
I mean, once he signs it,
if they make an arrest,

282
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,534
it won't take these guys long
to figure out

283
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,202
it was me that talked to the Feds.

284
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,539
Well, once he signs,
it'll be a matter of hours, not days.

285
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,874
The WITSEC arrangements
are already being made.

286
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,753
- You know where they're sending me?
- Nope.

287
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,964
And I never will.
Nobody will.

288
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,215
Except for the DOJ.

289
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,758
If you need to reach me for anything,

290
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,885
you're gonna have to contact me
through the WITSEC officer.

291
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,720
It's not just the Armenians I'm afraid of.

292
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,264
- Lucas...
- I know you never believed me

293
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,891
- about the president but--
- Look. Listen carefully.

294
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,313
The U.S. government is not your enemy now.

295
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,691
Okay? They're protecting you.

296
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,444
He is the government.

297
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,655
Not even the White House knows
who gets released on Rule 35.

298
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,368
Unless the Attorney General tells them,
which almost never happens.

299
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,914
Listen.

300
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,500
You did good work here, Lucas.

301
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,420
You're getting out.

302
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,966
Try to be happy about that.

303
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,566
This how you unwind?

304
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,110
I've never been here in my life.

305
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,487
I wanted some place
we wouldn't be recognized.

306
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,823
Rack 'em up.

307
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,250
- You said you had something to offer.
- Yes.

308
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,711
Insurance.

309
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,131
We took Iowa.
We're closing the gap in New Hampshire.

310
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,133
You squeaked by in Iowa.

311
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,343
You're not gonna close the gap
in New Hampshire by Tuesday.

312
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:33,097
- You're overconfident.
- And you're still Press Secretary.

313
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,059
He didn't make you Chief of Staff.

314
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,561
Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.

315
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,688
What's your ask?

316
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,151
One solid thing for us to work with.

317
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,986
It tanks him, you got a cushion.

318
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,280
It doesn't?

319
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,073
You still have your job
in the White House.

320
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,575
Why should I trust you?

321
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,419
Wouldn't you rather have
a back-up plan in your pocket if you lose?

322
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,800
Your shot.

323
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,845
We guarantee you
a place in our administration

324
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,515
after my two years as Chief of Staff.

325
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,724
Then it's you.

326
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,353
Tell me what's happening in Texas.

327
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:56,180
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Congresswoman, so good to see you.

328
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,350
Wonderful to see you, too.
Please, come in.

329
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,817
Celia, so good to see you, too.

330
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,238
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.

331
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,574
LeAnn called me a little while ago.
Said she couldn't make it.

332
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,499
Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn
to have this meeting set up

333
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,878
because I have a radical proposal,
and I wanted to make it in person.

334
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,299
Well, Doug has already filled me in.

335
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,012
Usually, I wouldn't endorse
anyone four years out,

336
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,681
but in this case,
I'm really open to it.

337
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,145
Anything to put a Democrat
into the governor's mansion.

338
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,896
I told the congresswoman that

339
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,899
enlisting her political machinery
in Dallas is a crucial first step.

340
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,236
Which is why
I asked my daughter to join us.

341
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,447
She'll have my seat by then,
and you two will work closely.

342
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,034
I have a great deal of respect for you,
Mrs. Underwood.

343
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,453
I think we can accomplish a lot together.

344
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,663
Well, actually, Congresswoman,

345
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,040
I've decided that
the governorship is a big leap

346
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,876
without holding any elected office first.

347
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,879
Are you thinking Senate next cycle?

348
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,550
No, I'm thinking
your district, this cycle.

349
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,427
That would mean your daughter holds off,

350
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,137
and then I would throw
my full weight behind her

351
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,182
to replace me when I run for governor.

352
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,683
I've already put together my team.

353
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,311
Oh, no, you would still
get the seat, Celia.

354
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,563
I'm just asking you
to wait a little longer.

355
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,315
And the president
thinks this is the best plan.

356
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,108
Why didn't you tell me this?

357
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,111
- I wasn't aware, ma'am.
- Well, he and I spoke privately about it.

358
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:39,908
Celia has waited over a decade
for me to retire.

359
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
It's her time.

360
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,369
I understand.

361
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,956
And that's why I want to put her
in the best position to succeed

362
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,459
- when she takes office.
- When was the last time

363
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,628
you set foot in this district?

364
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,630
When Francis was elected whip.

365
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,383
So, how are we supposed
to ask our people to support a woman

366
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,134
that doesn't even know them?

367
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,512
Their lives, their everyday struggles.

368
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,722
Carpetbagger.

369
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,557
Who's white.

370
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,852
It goes deeper than race,
Mrs. Underwood.

371
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,398
You grew up in Highland Park,
never wanted for anything.

372
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:15,193
You just don't reflect our community.

373
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,238
Congresswoman makes a good point.

374
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,285
What I want is a stepping stone.

375
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:27,373
And what you want is federal funding
for a breast cancer center

376
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,165
run by Planned Parenthood.

377
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,004
Something that a Republican-controlled
Congress will never do.

378
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,923
Especially in a VA hospital.

379
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,261
You had resistance even when
the Democrats controlled the House.

380
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,473
But there's not one congressperson,
Republican or Democrat,

381
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,308
that would refuse a meeting
with the First Lady.

382
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,560
You're right, Mrs. Underwood.

383
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,940
We haven't accomplished
everything we set out to do.

384
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,861
But the one thing
my constituents have always had...

385
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:04,826
is the pride that they take
in being represented by one of their own.

386
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:10,249
I refuse to rob them of that.

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,419
Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.

388
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,463
We'll reassess our thinking
and get back to you. Thank you.

389
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,852
You tell the president
to stay out of this.

390
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,229
Maybe you should speak to him directly.

391
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,775
As soon as he's willing
to support this race, I'll talk to him.

392
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,235
You're making a mistake, Mrs. Underwood.

393
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,631
<i>A source within
the White House tells us this,</i>

394
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>that the First Lady traveled to Texas</i>

395
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,386
<i>after some sort of a major
argument with her husband.</i>

396
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,305
<i>Well, the president has claimed
that she went to Dallas</i>

397
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,765
<i>to lay groundwork for the Texas primary.</i>

398
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,394
<i>But there's no evidence
of any campaign events or fundraisers</i>

399
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,646
<i>since she arrived there three days ago,</i>

400
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,815
<i>and she hasn't appeared publicly.</i>

401
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,776
<i>So, Monica, gotta get your take on this.</i>

402
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,653
<i>Well, if there is marital discord,</i>

403
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,114
<i>the Underwoods certainly
wouldn't want to admit it.</i>

404
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,743
<i>Her being down there for the primary?
Come on, that could be a smokescreen.</i>

405
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,078
<i>- Juan?
- Well, come on, Gretchen. Let's be real.</i>

406
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,913
<i>Something's rotten
in the state of Denmark.</i>

407
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,874
<i>I mean, the timing on this
could not be worse.</i>

408
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,127
<i>Don't forget,
the New Hampshire primary is tomorrow.</i>

409
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,046
<i>So, whatever momentum the president had
coming out of Iowa...</i>

410
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,508
<i>Just like
air going out of a popped balloon.</i>

411
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,968
<i>Well, you know
that Heather Dunbar</i>

412
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,639
<i>is gonna have something to say about this.
Let's take a look.</i>

413
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,182
<i>I don't know whether
this story is true or not,</i>

414
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,269
<i>but if it is, I hope that
the president and the First Lady</i>

415
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,480
<i>can work out their differences.</i>

416
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,107
<i>No one likes to see
a marriage under strain.</i>

417
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,528
<i>Personally, I wouldn't be able</i>

418
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,447
<i>to carry on my campaign
without the incredible...</i>

419
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,657
Do we know
where the leak came from?

420
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,618
<i>We're talking
to Secret Service and to staff now,</i>

421
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,952
<i>but no, sir, we don't know yet.</i>

422
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,704
I'm looking at a ten-pound
stack of clippings,

423
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,915
and that's just what's been written
in the past hour.

424
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,376
This is Dunbar.
I know she's behind this.

425
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,420
Sir, I might have a solution.

426
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,965
May we speak privately for a moment?

427
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,717
<i>Yeah. Seth, hop off the line.</i>

428
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,260
If we're gonna switch tactics,
I think I should--

429
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,096
<i>I'll fill you in
if the president wants to move forward.</i>

430
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,723
<i>Hop off, Seth.</i>

431
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,349
<i>During the debates,
we all remember,</i>

432
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,687
<i>Underwood went after Sharp
for sending her kids to private...</i>

433
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,105
<i>All right, go ahead.</i>

434
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,273
Claire's mother.

435
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,650
What about her?

436
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,013
I told you
when you were five years old

437
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,266
not to come in this house
without saying hello to me.

438
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,481
I came by when I arrived.
You were asleep.

439
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,524
That was two days ago.

440
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,401
Well, I wasn't sure you wanted
to see me, Mother.

441
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,153
Well...

442
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,492
as long as we're living
under the same roof

443
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:35,036
- and besieged by news trucks--
- I apologize for all that.

444
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,205
Is it true?

445
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,416
Hmm? Is that why you came down here?

446
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,920
No, I came down here because...

447
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,508
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,718
That woman who visited...

449
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,139
- LeAnn Harvey.
- Mmm-hmm, I know who she is.

450
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,976
She calls me all the time
asking for money when she's...

451
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,313
peddling some candidate.

452
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,942
Are you the candidate?

453
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,155
Congress. 30th District.

454
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,616
I see.

455
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,161
You don't approve.

456
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,706
Well, you've
always made your choices

457
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,501
regardless of what I think.

458
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,294
What does he think?

459
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,880
Has he spoken to you?
To discourage me?

460
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,801
He hasn't spoken to me
since the day of your daddy's funeral.

461
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,261
Just like you haven't.

462
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,306
Not even a phone call
when you became First Lady--

463
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,600
If you don't want me here,
I can make other arrangements.

464
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:43,438
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
This house is as much yours as it is mine.

465
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,148
I put covers on everything

466
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,777
because the maids were
cleaning rooms I never set foot in.

467
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,071
But now that you're here...

468
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,573
Just leave them.

469
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,408
I only need a bedroom.

470
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,079
Fine.

471
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,457
This house is just a hotel to you.

472
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,675
The president will arrive
in Dallas later this afternoon.

473
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,510
As to the nature of his trip,
I can't comment at this time

474
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:17,263
other than to say he plans
on seeing the First Lady.

475
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,473
- Seth!
- Mark.

476
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,767
His going down there
would seem to lend legitimacy

477
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,770
to claims that they're having
marital issues, wouldn't it?

478
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,772
We've already denied those claims.

479
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,608
- Seth!
- Sara.

480
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,735
Neither the president nor the First Lady

481
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,903
have publicly responded
since this story broke.

482
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,071
Can we expect them to?

483
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,866
What you're calling a story
isn't a story.

484
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,785
It's a flashy headline that gives you
a bump in Twitter followers.

485
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,245
It doesn't warrant a response,

486
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,957
but if the president or First Lady
chooses to make one,

487
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,208
you'll be the first to know.

488
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,919
- Seth!
- Thank you all very much.

489
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,010
- How long has she been gone?
- Not long.

490
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,720
- LeAnn Harvey's office.
- Christ.

491
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,180
The press didn't follow her, did they?

492
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,974
No. They took a utility road out.
No police escort.

493
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,884
Are you two gonna make
a habit of showing up here

494
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,096
without even the courtesy of asking?

495
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,183
I wish I didn't have to be here,
but your daughter's made it necessary.

496
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,601
You know, when she got married,

497
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,688
I was sure she would wake up
in a year or two.

498
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,150
I had no idea
it was gonna take her 30.

499
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,237
Claire is the First Lady
of the United States,

500
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,073
and you still think
she made the wrong choice.

501
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,951
Reduced to tabloid gossip?

502
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,329
She might as well be living
in that trailer park you come from.

503
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,500
Well, it was a peach farm.
But you're right, I am still white trash.

504
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,755
I just happen to be white trash
that lives in the White House.

505
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,801
Not even being president
could give you any class.

506
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,348
Well, let me tell you
what's about to happen, Elizabeth.

507
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,726
I am not going
to put myself in the crossfire

508
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,519
between a president and First Lady.

509
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,312
Oh, I'll handle Francis.

510
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,606
You said he was on board.

511
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,650
And I'll make sure he is.

512
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,944
The point is you misled me,
Mrs. Underwood.

513
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,239
What is it you want, LeAnn?
Is it money?

514
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,201
Or do you want more,
to make a real mark?

515
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,745
I don't have to choose.
I can have both.

516
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,372
Well, if you wanna make history,
you need to get out of Texas.

517
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,167
I've turned down plenty of jobs in D.C.

518
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,335
Juggling 15 clients a year.

519
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:40,133
But I want the next 15 years of your life.
Texas is just where we begin.

520
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,660
It seems you didn't hear me after all.

521
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,704
I don't respond to threats.

522
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,957
You're speaking
to the president.

523
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,166
Yes, I recognize his voice.

524
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,585
I'd like to talk to my wife alone, please.

525
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,213
She stays.
Tell me what you need to tell me.

526
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,883
Doug.

527
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,733
She's been sick for three years.
Radiation, chemotherapy, the works.

528
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,906
But you didn't know, did you?

529
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,410
You're not dragging my mother
in front of the cameras.

530
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:53,289
Just you, and you're going to say
that that's why you're down here.

531
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,458
This is a family matter, Francis.

532
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,837
This has to be done, Claire.
We have to kill this story.

533
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,297
He's right.

534
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,220
I need to know you won't meddle
with my campaign.

535
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
The State of the Union is in two weeks.

536
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,642
You show up for that,
then I'll leave you alone.

537
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,477
Let's get this over with.

538
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,877
When Claire first
came down here to Dallas...

539
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,381
we said it was to lay the groundwork
for the Texas primary.

540
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,383
And that was partially true.

541
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,970
What we left out was something
that we hoped to keep private.

542
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,847
But in light of false stories
over the last number of days

543
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,683
about the state of our marriage,

544
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,812
we now feel it's important
to share this unfortunate news.

545
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,272
Claire.

546
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,150
For the past three years,

547
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,153
my mother has been suffering
from intermittent lymphoma.

548
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,615
Initially, she had some success
battling her illness,

549
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,410
but it's come back full force
the last several months.

550
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,164
So, I came down here
to spend time with her

551
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,708
while she undergoes further treatment.

552
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,962
And we ask just for the sake
of my mother's dignity...

553
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,342
and well-being
that you respect her privacy.

554
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,011
Thank you.

555
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,058
I will be resuming my campaign tomorrow

556
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,228
and Claire will, of course,
be staying here.

557
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,437
And let me just add...

558
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,192
Claire's mother is blessed
to have such a loving daughter.

559
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,862
And I am blessed to have
such a thoughtful and caring wife.

560
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,489
Thank you all very much.

561
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,182
Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.

562
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,673
You're officially John Carlyle now.

563
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,890
Driver's license is expired on purpose.
You take the bus to work.

564
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,727
Memorize everything,
address, birthday, social.

565
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,855
There's a personal history in there
for you to know by heart, too.

566
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,234
- "Pegasus Car Rentals"?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,570
You wash rentals.
It starts tomorrow.

568
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,987
Keep a low profile.

569
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,949
Don't be weird about it,
don't go out of your way to make friends.

570
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,661
What if there's...

571
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,497
If something's wrong?

572
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,042
Landline goes directly
to our local office.

573
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,045
Away from home,
use the cell phone next to it.

574
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,342
What else? You have basic cable.
No Internet, obviously.

575
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,054
Keep the blinds drawn
and the doors locked.

576
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,015
That's it.

577
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,148
I'll check in with you later this week.

578
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,287
<i>Now, we didn't just win</i>

579
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,330
<i>a plurality here in New Hampshire.</i>

580
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,166
<i>We won a majority.</i>

581
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,337
<i>Now, you know what that tells me?</i>

582
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,464
It's looking like Dunbar's got it
by 11 or 12 points

583
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,133
by the time everything's counted.

584
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,009
How many precincts have reported?

585
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,512
As of two minutes ago, 83%.

586
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,098
Seth drafted a speech for when we land.

587
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,976
Normally, Dunbar would wait
to give her speech until after yours,

588
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,102
but since we're on the plane--

589
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,897
- Get her on the phone and I'll concede.
- Yes, sir.

590
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,320
Look at that snot-nosed pretty-boy.

591
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,822
I'll bet he just learned how to shave.

592
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,076
Get me Dunbar.

593
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,413
- Ma'am, I really think--
- Open it.

594
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,249
She wants to be left alone.

595
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,085
Unlock the door.

596
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,148
I want you to go!

597
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,068
Mother...

598
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,820
why didn't you tell me?

599
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:01,156
Because it was none of your business.

600
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:04,410
- Just listen to me.
- No, don't even bother.

601
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,039
I understand why you did what you did.

602
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,835
But that doesn't make it any less hurtful.

603
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,503
Is that for me or for yourself?

604
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,966
Claire.

605
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,678
Come here.

606
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,724
Come here.

607
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,978
You're stronger than he is.

608
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,774
But you gotta put him in his place.

609
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:25,732
