1
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,452
<i>Otherwise, it was just socialism,
which is built to fail.</i>

2
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,748
<i>And you don't get points
for failure, Mr. President.</i>

3
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,168
<i>People don't want failure.
They want success.</i>

4
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,754
<i>Let's discuss
our recent success then.</i>

5
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,839
You have been very critical
of the president

6
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,966
for not being strong on terror.

7
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,721
Just last week, U.S. special forces
captured Yusuf Al Ahmadi,

8
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,222
and they have him in custody.

9
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,226
So would you now say that your criticism
of the president was unfounded?

10
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,063
The capture of Ahmadi
is a step forward,

11
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,650
but the real issue here
is sustained security.

12
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,445
The president sent in American troops
without consulting the Syrians.

13
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,781
Now, that's gonna do real damage

14
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,704
to our ability to work with them
in the future.

15
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>See, this isn't about notches in a belt.</i>

16
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,206
<i>It's about a safer world for our nation.</i>

17
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,792
<i>A better future for our children.</i>

18
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,714
<i>Governor, I understand that words
like "safer" and "children" play well.</i>

19
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,050
<i>But national security is a complex
and ever-changing landscape</i>

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,387
that sometimes requires restraint,
sometimes decisive action.

21
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,809
So I think maybe we want to put aside
what sounds good in the moment

22
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,561
and be adaptable with our policy
in terms of reality.

23
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,357
Oh, I don't need a lecture on reality
like I'm a schoolboy, Mrs. Underwood.

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,693
I've actually fought in the Middle East.
So has the general.

25
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,280
Our views on international diplomacy
aren't just pretty words.

26
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,117
We can debate policy
all you'd like, Governor,

27
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,369
but there is one thing
that is undebatable.

28
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,413
<i>And that is ICO is no longer
the threat it once was</i>

29
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,874
<i>without their leadership.</i>

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,296
- You're not watching the debate?
- I know what they're going to say.

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,965
How can I help you, Doug?

32
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,760
I told you there'd be a day.

33
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,809
There's no reason you shouldn't keep this
and retire with honor.

34
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,562
How are we looking?

35
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,982
<i>Yeah,
high impact on "ever-changing."</i>

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,275
<i>And Conway took the bait</i>

37
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,112
and played right into
"schoolboy" and "pretty,"

38
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,240
which gives you "pretty boy."
It was beautiful.

39
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,410
<i>- What about the marriage stuff?</i>
- Well, the more they can keep saying

40
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,206
"together" and "beyond" and "become"
in any context, we score on those.

41
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,002
I don't discuss the private conversations
we have on the Intelligence Committee.

42
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,339
- Whistle-blowing insulates you.
- And kneecap my party's nominee?

43
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,674
I don't think so.

44
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,969
He's going to lie about it at this debate.
They both are.

45
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,305
You're going to tell the truth.

46
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,850
You can't have it both ways, Governor.
We got him, period.

47
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,269
Unilateral, short-sighted action.

48
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,438
Unilateral because you and the general

49
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,066
pitted the Republicans
against my involving the Russians.

50
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,275
That's just not true.

51
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,153
Are you saying
that you did not have the general

52
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,239
contact members
of the House Intelligence Committee?

53
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,575
General,
would you care to comment?

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,243
When I resigned my commission,

55
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,621
I stopped talking to members of Congress
about matters of national security.

56
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,209
- So you are saying that you did not?
- No, ma'am. I did not.

57
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,462
You and I both know
that you interfered, Governor.

58
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,965
You admitted so much to me
when I asked you personally.

59
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,718
You told me that the general had spoken
to members of that committee.

60
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,889
I told you that I have friends
on the committee, which is true.

61
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,016
Not that I interfere with committee work.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,520
You lined up every Republican to be
opposed to the Russians being involved.

63
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
It was unanimous opposition.

64
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,649
Well, if your plan was
to get Russian support

65
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,694
by giving away drill sites,
I don't blame them.

66
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,780
<i>So just to be absolutely clear,
for the record,</i>

67
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,952
<i>you are saying, Governor, that neither you
nor the general made any contact</i>

68
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,954
<i>with any member of
the House Intelligence Committee?</i>

69
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>I absolutely did not.</i>

70
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,666
You're putting me
in an impossible place here.

71
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,295
You put yourself there
when you lied about your service record.

72
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,091
Whose lie do you want exposed?
Conway's or yours?

73
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,718
Go home and think about it.

74
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,766
Doesn't need to happen tomorrow.

75
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,144
It just needs to happen
before Election Day.

76
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,653
I'm not trying
to diminish your contribution

77
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,031
to your husband's presidency,
Mrs. Underwood,

78
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,158
but I do question your experience.

79
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,412
No one's fully prepared to be president
when he or she becomes one.

80
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,455
Not even you.

81
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,581
And look at the polls.

82
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,127
Over half the country
is open to a First Lady as VP.

83
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,587
And more than half of the country
wants a new president.

84
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,882
It's true that you are leading
in the polls for now, Governor,

85
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,427
but the gap has been closing
in recent weeks.

86
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,970
Well, when people show up to vote

87
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,933
and have to confront the possibility
of Claire Underwood as president,

88
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,435
they're gonna have a gut check
and make the right choice.

89
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,063
You're absolutely right.
That means they'll vote for us.

90
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,982
Because they'll look around and realize
that if anything happens to me,

91
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,984
they'll be in very good hands with Claire.

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,569
And, you know, she's right.

93
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,780
No one can prepare
to become the president.

94
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,784
But I have been the president,
and now I know what it takes.

95
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,870
It requires confidence, openness,
effectiveness,

96
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,957
and Claire has all of those qualities.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm sorry, Mr. President. It...
It looks like we have to take a break.

98
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,879
We'll return shortly
to the first-ever simultaneous debate

99
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,591
between presidential candidates
and their running mates.

100
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,218
And we're clear.

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,347
Mr. President, Mrs. Underwood,
would you please come with me?

102
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>Read it.</i>

103
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,653
<i>What?</i>

104
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,490
<i>"We are citizens of the United States.</i>

105
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,994
<i>We have been taken hostage
in the name of God</i>

106
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,038
<i>by the Islamic Caliphate Organization."</i>

107
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,167
<i>Read it.</i>

108
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,379
<i>"Our country is guilty
of illegal aggression</i>

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,672
<i>and mass murder against Muslims.</i>

110
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,508
<i>We beg for mercy."</i>

111
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>ICO will grant mercy
only if these demands are met.</i>

112
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,682
<i>One, cessation
of all U.S. military activity in Syria.</i>

113
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>Two, ten billion dollars in reparations
paid to the caliphate.</i>

114
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,648
<i>Three, the safe return of our leader,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi,</i>

115
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,650
<i>from his unjust imprisonment.</i>

116
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,069
<i>We will not communicate
with the criminal Frank Underwood.</i>

117
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,322
<i>We will only communicate
with his successor, William Conway.</i>

118
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,202
<i>If these demands aren't met in 24 hours...</i>

119
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,372
<i>mercy will not be granted.</i>

120
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,500
Released to seven outlets.
Encrypted email, deep web.

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,547
The hostages are Jim and Caroline Miller,
their daughter Melissa, from Knoxville.

122
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,675
Mr. President, whatever you need,
I'm here to offer assistance.

123
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,677
I'll let you know.

124
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,353
So far, we've identified
the drywall and lighting.

125
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,813
All U.S. manufactured.

126
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,317
The video was shot
on a Panasonic HD camcorder,

127
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,069
most widely sold in the States.

128
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,196
So we know they're in the country.

129
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,948
Well, commercial flight is out.
Private plane is unlikely.

130
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,700
We're confident
that they traveled by ground,

131
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,827
probably the Millers' hijacked car.

132
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,497
Last known location is a Denny's
just outside of Knoxville.

133
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,582
A debit card transaction.

134
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,085
This is footage of them
leaving the restaurant.

135
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,801
Our hearts go out
to the Millers' family and loved ones.

136
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,054
But we're confident
that the president is doing

137
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,139
everything possible
to achieve their release.

138
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,015
I told the president that we'd be willing

139
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,144
to assist in any way
if it would be helpful.

140
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,397
This is a time when America
needs to pull together and...

141
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,816
Stop.

142
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,112
It's "pull together
and pray for the Millers."

143
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,280
- And then I come in, and...
- I didn't forget.

144
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,991
I just feel this is wrong.

145
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,536
It implies we're willing
to negotiate with terrorists.

146
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,914
We should keep our mouths shut.
Let the authorities do their job.

147
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,085
We don't get press
by keeping our mouths shut.

148
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,920
You had me lie on national television.

149
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,216
And now you want us to send out some video
that only encourages these people?

150
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,426
And you wanna do that
to score some press coverage?

151
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,847
If it doesn't make you feel comfortable,
I can do it on my own.

152
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,643
I'll be outside.

153
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,108
I've had enough of him.

154
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,401
He does have a point.

155
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,363
Look, they're gonna kill that family
whether we send this out or not.

156
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,073
We might as well say
I was willing to show up for duty.

157
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,825
Well, I have to say,
I agree with the general.

158
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,452
Press record.

159
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,037
Press record!

160
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,210
Our hearts go out
to the Millers' family and loved ones...

161
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,920
What do we know about the captor?

162
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,423
Our Syrian assets say this is a lone wolf.

163
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,882
Two wolves, actually.

164
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,302
When we pumped up
the contrast in the video,

165
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,680
we saw a shadow on the wall
from someone behind the camera.

166
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,600
Voice analysis points
to western Tennessee, Memphis area.

167
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,811
Uh, Mr. President, if I may?

168
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,063
Agent Holbrooke,
our top negotiating expert.

169
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,234
Uh, we've run 16 possible models
in preparation for an incident like this.

170
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,654
Now, what we have here
are key elements from three of them.

171
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,575
American kidnappers, the abduction
of a child and proxy communication...

172
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,327
Why did they want Conway?

173
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,745
That's the real question.
I'll tell you why.

174
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,458
Because I would've done
exactly the same thing if it had been me.

175
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,210
It undermines my authority.

176
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,630
Throws me off balance.
Pits me against my rival.

177
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,800
And because I don't have children,
and he does.

178
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,387
They know I won't compromise.
No president would.

179
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,933
But a would-be president like Conway,
well, he might.

180
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,353
Tactically, we need more time.

181
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,116
I can't guarantee that we can
track them down in less than 24 hours.

182
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,525
Enough.
Here's what I wanna do.

183
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,110
The president
is working with the FBI

184
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,529
and other law enforcement
and intelligence agencies

185
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,323
to locate the Millers.

186
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,533
Now, in order to protect
the integrity of those efforts,

187
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,703
I won't be sharing any details
on their progress at the moment.

188
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,332
In the meantime, the president
is reaching out to Governor Conway

189
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,585
should contact with the captors
be established.

190
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,211
Now, let me be clear.

191
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,800
We're not talking about negotiation,
just communication.

192
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,303
You could've asked me
privately first.

193
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,596
<i>It was tactical,</i>

194
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,266
<i>to show the kidnappers
that we respect their wishes.</i>

195
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,976
This doesn't leave me a choice.

196
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,853
Well, you can always say no, Governor.

197
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,274
We have a plan for how we can
handle this without your participation.

198
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,816
<i>How would that work?</i>

199
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,111
Well, I say publicly that I'm willing
to speak to the captors myself.

200
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,240
Now, if they refuse,
we'd have to be prepared for the worst.

201
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:26,538
<i>But our team believes that you give us
a better shot at opening a dialogue.</i>

202
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,582
- To negotiate.
<i>- To buy us time.</i>

203
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,208
And if you do say yes,

204
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,378
we'd want you at the White House
as soon as possible.

205
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,130
I need to discuss with my people.

206
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,343
<i>I'm hoping that you'll agree to help us.
Either way, I'll need an answer soon.</i>

207
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,430
I understand.
I'll let you know within the hour.

208
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,264
Thank you, Governor.

209
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,062
Everyone has a flaw, and this is Conway's.

210
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,315
<i>I spoke with the president,
and I said that I'm willing</i>

211
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,692
<i>to assist in any way
if it would be helpful.</i>

212
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,906
He aches for the spotlight.
He feels almost invisible without it.

213
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,661
Now, if he's center stage on this,
he can't fault my performance,

214
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,539
because we're sharing the stage together.

215
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,958
If I get booed, he gets booed.

216
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,213
But it's really the applause
that Conway's hungry for.

217
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,466
Trust me, he'll say yes.

218
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:24,346
The stage is too big and the spotlight
too tempting for him to be...

219
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,349
a mere spectator.

220
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,726
But I've already said publicly
I'd assist if he asked.

221
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,812
That was a mistake,
and I should've pushed back on it more.

222
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,397
But you can't let him
take advantage of it.

223
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,774
Well, I've said it. It's done.
And now we have to move forward.

224
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,693
This is fucking disgusting.

225
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,695
You say, "After much consideration,

226
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,898
I don't feel comfortable
negotiating with terrorists."

227
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,200
And then I come off not only as a liar,
but as a coward.

228
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,744
Why do this when we're ahead?

229
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,287
By what? Five points?
That's not a lead. That's a coin toss.

230
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,041
My message this entire campaign
has been about serving the country,

231
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,586
showing up for duty,
and now I'm gonna not show up

232
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,464
when the commander in chief
has asked for my help?

233
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,597
<i>...and the speech patterns.</i>

234
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,808
<i>The captor is
the one who you heard on the camera.</i>

235
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,477
<i>Seems to be American.</i>

236
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,313
<i>And the way he's released the video
shows he's computer savvy.</i>

237
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:20,317
<i>Now, ICO recruiters have been
turning to social media networks</i>

238
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,530
<i>like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,</i>

239
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,866
<i>to initiate contact with users
sympathetic to their cause.</i>

240
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,452
- Oh, Tom.
<i>- Earlier groups, like al-Qaeda,</i>

241
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,205
<i>didn't use social networking
anywhere near the degree that ICO has.</i>

242
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,750
<i>It is possible that this captor...</i>

243
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,420
- Mr. President.
- Good flight?

244
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,797
- A little bumpy, but fine.
- Come on in.

245
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,217
You play?

246
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,015
Well, that's debatable.
But I definitely collect.

247
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,519
Uh, this is something.

248
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,981
Yeah, it's terrible.

249
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,901
I don't envy Frank right now.

250
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,486
Have a seat.

251
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,572
- Coffee? Tea?
- No, thanks.

252
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,956
I appreciate you taking the time,
given everything that's going on.

253
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,667
It's not as though
anyone's calling for my advice.

254
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,421
Although I'm not sure
this article is pertinent at the moment.

255
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,549
I'm not here about your scholarship fund.

256
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,427
I don't understand.
My assistant said you wanted to write...

257
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,180
I lied...
so you'd meet with me.

258
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,308
We have a domestic surveillance program,
beta phase,

259
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,227
aimed at finding ICO recruits.

260
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,190
I was briefed
when we got the FISA court ruling.

261
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,691
Well, this is a domestic investigation.
We have to work through the FBI.

262
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,900
Now, they're sending over a team,

263
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,612
and I'd like for Homeland and the CIA
to join them.

264
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,991
This is a sensitive program.
Shouldn't you keep it in-house?

265
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,202
We've been criticized for not involving
other agencies in the past.

266
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,371
I'd like to avoid that.

267
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,332
- You want clearances?
- As soon as possible.

268
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,585
It's all hands on deck, Doug.

269
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,088
- Governor.
- Mr. President.

270
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,053
Well, and this must be Charlie.

271
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,764
Charlie...

272
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,474
Shake
the president's hand, Charlie.

273
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,726
- Come on, Charlie.
- You said he was a vampire.

274
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,480
Well, don't worry. You're safe here.

275
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,148
No monsters in the White House.

276
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,901
I'll show you where you're staying.

277
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,611
Okay.
Come on, Charlie.

278
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,533
- Have you ever been in the Oval?
- Once, when I was a kid.

279
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,201
My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.

280
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,245
Of course they did.

281
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,419
I thought you'd all like to be together,
so I've put you in here,

282
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,756
but, if not, we can put the kids
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

283
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,383
No, this is wonderful.
Thank you.

284
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,222
Is this
where we're gonna live, Mommy?

285
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,226
We'll have to see
how the election goes first.

286
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,478
Something smells.

287
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,690
Oh, gosh.
Lily needs a change.

288
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,942
Um, where...

289
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,987
- The restroom is here, to the right.
- Great, thank you.

290
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,228
<i>You want me to put
a Republican in the White House.</i>

291
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,207
You want a Republican or a criminal?

292
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,461
- I still have loyalty to my party, Tom.
- And where's their loyalty?

293
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,799
They were going to impeach you.

294
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,927
Jackie Sharp whipped Democrats.

295
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,972
Your own Secretary of State
turned her back.

296
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,808
Your party?
It's rotten to the core.

297
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,603
And the core is Underwood.

298
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,860
Aren't you angry
that he stole your presidency?

299
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm angry.

300
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,865
I'm angry at myself...

301
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,159
for not seeing it.

302
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,582
- And for not fighting it.
- So do something now.

303
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,087
I wanted to say Tusk lied.

304
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,593
But once I got the pardon,
I knew nobody would believe me.

305
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,013
I thought...

306
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,557
"Just disappear.

307
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,769
Go away."

308
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,147
And that anger...

309
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,069
If I went away...

310
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,909
that anger would go away.

311
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,577
The truth is coming out.

312
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,666
Be part of the truth.

313
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,252
People will believe you.

314
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,507
Once we finish with the press conference,
you'll be done.

315
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,677
We'll take it from there.

316
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,804
You don't want me on the call
if they contact us?

317
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh, you're only there for bait, Governor.

318
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,390
I can't have you speaking
on behalf of the White House.

319
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,061
- They said they wanted me.
- Yes, we have a roadmap in place.

320
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,813
Then you'll have to adjust it.

321
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,820
What right do you have to walk in here
and dictate how we're gonna handle this?

322
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,031
I put myself on the line coming here,
and you know it.

323
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,534
I could've backed off
and left this pile of shit in your lap.

324
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,161
Now, if I'm gonna be exposed with you,

325
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,247
then I'm gonna have some say
in how that happens.

326
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,501
Or I head back to New York
and watch you squirm.

327
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,842
Just as I'd hoped.
The more involved, the better.

328
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,261
Director Green, please.

329
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,809
- They here? All right.
- They're here.

330
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,603
Thanks.

331
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,240
This is our director.

332
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,533
- Hello.
- President's Chief of Staff.

333
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
We need every white male under 40

334
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,330
with geo-local anomalies
in the past 72 hours.

335
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,415
Already done that,
cross-referenced with your watchlists.

336
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,179
We're voice matching with phone calls now.

337
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,711
Well, we're bringing a team in here.

338
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,546
FBI, CIA, Homeland,
along with our own people.

339
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,507
Uh, yeah,
more cooks in the kitchen won't...

340
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,927
I've cleared them.
We can't waste time grapevining this.

341
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,764
Let's get everyone working
from the same place.

342
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,307
We need to organize workflow.

343
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,895
Right. Uh, let's talk in my office.
It's the second door on the right.

344
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,607
Is this going to be a problem?

345
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,234
I'd prefer them
not breathing down my neck.

346
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,570
- That wasn't my question.
- I told you, we're masked.

347
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,409
Thank you.
Please be seated.

348
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,956
I'd like to thank Governor Conway
for agreeing to assist us.

349
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,961
He and I share the same goal,
which is the safe return of the Millers.

350
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,129
In order to achieve that,

351
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,257
we're willing to open up
lines of communication with their captors.

352
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,425
Governor.

353
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,348
I will act as intermediary
between you and the president.

354
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,477
To communicate with us,
dial Jim Miller's social security number

355
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:14,857
followed by Caroline's into any phone
or Internet conferencing service.

356
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,026
There will be a voice recognition prompt.

357
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,197
Have all three Millers say
their names and state the time

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,324
and that will connect you.

359
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,663
Our hearts are with the Millers
and their families.

360
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:34,085
I spoke to their siblings
and their parents last night,

361
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,087
and they remain strong.

362
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,966
And I would ask all Americans
to remain strong on their behalf.

363
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,092
Thank you very much.

364
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:46,347
<i>Deplorable as this situation is,
we cannot blame Islam as a whole</i>

365
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,476
<i>or the millions of Muslims
in our nation who yearn for peace,</i>

366
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,062
<i>who contribute to our society,</i>

367
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,565
who have the same dreams
as all Americans do.

368
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,568
ICO does not represent Islam.

369
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,614
<i>But there are those
who would use this incident</i>

370
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,033
<i>to justify draconian measures,</i>

371
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,745
<i>like travel restrictions
or forced registration,</i>

372
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,332
<i>who would espouse hatred
or even violence.</i>

373
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,461
The moment bigotry
becomes a form of patriotism,

374
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,090
America is no longer America.

375
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,550
That is why I'm here today,
in the Capitol,

376
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,012
to urge our congressmen and women...

377
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,446
Hear there's a push
to get the ten billion.

378
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,616
Big debate in Ways and Means,
but it'll never make it to the floor.

379
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,161
It's just for show.

380
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,579
I've been with Appropriations.

381
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,957
- Bypass Ways and Means?
- No.

382
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,419
To pay for more ground troops in Syria
if we need them.

383
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,257
So why are you meeting me
instead of at the Capitol?

384
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,094
Tom Hammerschmidt.

385
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,847
Has he called you, too?

386
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,894
He reached out,
but I haven't said a word.

387
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,149
Walker went on record.

388
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,776
Told him I was the one
who whipped the votes for impeachment.

389
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,155
Your story is you thought he was guilty.
There's nothing wrong with that.

390
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,490
So you have talked to him?

391
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,326
He has some theories.

392
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
All I did was shake my head
at the parts that weren't right.

393
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,957
You're clean if you don't talk.

394
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,877
I want to.
On the record.

395
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,842
I think you should, too.

396
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,387
We can't.

397
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,807
You will lose your seat
as soon as those photos are leaked.

398
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,726
I may lose my seat anyway.

399
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,897
Conway's super PAC is targeting
every California Democrat in a tight race.

400
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:05,236
Even if I win,
I'm in a Republican-controlled Congress

401
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,154
with a Republican president...

402
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,532
or I have to do Underwood's bidding
for the next four years.

403
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,701
What about Alan?

404
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,745
I told him about us.

405
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,832
He was kind about it.

406
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,545
We'll divorce once everything quiets down.

407
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,807
If you don't want the photos out there,
I won't say anything.

408
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,479
I don't care about
what the rest of the world thinks of me.

409
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,982
All I cared about was protecting you.

410
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,818
Then let's do this, Remy.

411
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,655
You and I go on the record, he's done.

412
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,786
Joshua Masterson.
Computer science major at Tennessee Tech.

413
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,955
Taken a keen interest in Islamic studies
during the past two years.

414
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,624
Hasn't been to class in three days.

415
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,709
None of his friends or family
have heard from him.

416
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,461
Voice matches the one in the video.

417
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,880
We believe his associate
is Zachary Hawthorne,

418
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,883
high school dropout
who's remained close with Masterson.

419
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,261
Stopped showing up for work last Tuesday.

420
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,431
So if they call, should I...

421
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,274
should I tell them
that we know who they are?

422
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,018
No, you'll introduce yourself, Governor,
then you introduce me.

423
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,980
No, the governor will do the talking,
so should he use their names or not?

424
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,317
It could cause them to do something rash.

425
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,154
- Agent March, our head psychologist.
- So I shouldn't.

426
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:34,075
Conversely, it could humanize them.
Removes the confidence of anonymity.

427
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,577
But if they run,
it compromises everything.

428
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,495
Not just that.
We're confident on the IDs,

429
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,581
but if there's
the slightest chance we're wrong,

430
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,957
it weakens our position.

431
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,917
Then don't use their names in the call.

432
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,130
Uh, sir, our script is written with
the understanding that I'd be speaking.

433
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,881
We'd have to rework it for the governor.

434
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,135
Well, then let's rework it now.
We don't know when they'll be calling.

435
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:58,765
You know, the circumstances are awful,
but I have to admit...

436
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,102
it's been nice
to take a break from the road.

437
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,271
I don't know how you do it,
running mate and First Lady.

438
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,483
I'm still trying
to figure that out myself, actually.

439
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,985
I think it's admirable.

440
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,822
If we win, I'd love to do something more
than update my Instagram.

441
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,659
When I criticized that,
it was just because...

442
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,663
No, not at all. I didn't take offense.
It's politics.

443
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,252
I'd love to do something
like your gun bill.

444
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,339
- It's a shame it didn't pass the Senate.
- You support that legislation?

445
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,510
Mmm, I'm from England.
We think your gun obsession is madness.

446
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,596
Will does, too, but he can't admit it.

447
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,390
Mustn't upset the base.

448
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:43,185
Ah, yes, the base.
Mustn't upset the base.

449
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,483
You know, you're actually
a role model of mine.

450
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:55,239
I mean, your work on the environment,
sexual assault, being ambassador...

451
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,160
I mean, obviously,
I'd prefer if we win.

452
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:04,165
But if we didn't, I think you'd make
a wonderful vice president.

453
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,124
Mommy, what are you drinking?

454
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,419
It's coffee, sweetheart.

455
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,046
- I want some! I want some!
- Shh!

456
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,090
- Not so loud. You'll wake your sister.
- Can I have some?

457
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,009
You're not old enough.

458
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,512
But do you want some water
or some juice?

459
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,014
I think we've got some juice
in the fridge.

460
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,808
I'll get it.

461
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,063
He's very cute.

462
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,649
Do you regret it, not having children?

463
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,611
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's too personal.

464
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,906
Do you ever regret having them?

465
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,080
We've got voice verification.
They're on the line, sir.

466
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,624
Do I need to keep them engaged
so you can trace the call?

467
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:48,959
No, Internet call.

468
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,628
Rerouted every three milliseconds.
Untraceable.

469
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,173
We have two main objectives.
More information, extending the deadline.

470
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,385
But our top priority
is a first concession. Proof of life.

471
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,513
- So you'll promise nothing.
- Okay.

472
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,099
Keep in mind
that they may be recording this call.

473
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,184
It's publicity they want.

474
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,062
Okay, I'm ready.

475
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,238
This is Governor Conway.

476
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,657
I'd like to speak
with Jim, Caroline and Melissa.

477
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,950
<i>You speak to me.</i>

478
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,536
I need some proof
that they're still alive.

479
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,129
Please tell Melissa
that her grandparents miss her very much

480
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,007
and, uh, they are praying for her.

481
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,635
<i>You're not gonna make us
feel sorry for 'em.</i>

482
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,886
<i>How sorry did you feel</i>

483
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,389
<i>when you dropped bombs
on innocent Muslims, Governor?</i>

484
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,559
<i>The president's a coward.
He sends others to do his killing.</i>

485
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,478
<i>But you're worse.</i>

486
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,524
<i>You make speeches about how proud you are
that you fought in an unjust war.</i>

487
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,569
<i>How would you feel if a bomb
was dropped on your daughter?</i>

488
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,324
<i>If she was blown up
and had to be buried in pieces?</i>

489
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,952
You're American, right?

490
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:10,081
<i>Our allegiance is to Yusuf Al Ahmadi
and the Islamic Caliphate.</i>

491
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,668
<i>America is our enemy
and must meet our demands.</i>

492
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,798
Uh, you understand that I can't speak
on behalf of the government.

493
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,884
I can only communicate
what you say to the president.

494
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,928
I'll need some time.

495
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,973
<i>You think we're stupid?
He's listening right now.</i>

496
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,686
This is the president speaking.

497
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,688
<i>We talk to Conway only.</i>

498
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,651
But if you want anything to happen,
I'm the one that can make it so.

499
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,778
<i>Then why have you done nothing?</i>

500
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,363
I'm talking to Congress about the money.

501
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,366
I'm consulting with my military advisers
about a pullout,

502
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,618
but nothing can happen in a few hours.

503
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,289
<i>You just want more time
so you can find us.</i>

504
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,499
Are we looking for you?
Yes.

505
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,377
But that's only so you'll turn over
the Millers without incident.

506
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,920
<i>But there is no handing over.</i>

507
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,798
<i>Either you give us what we want
or we kill them.</i>

508
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,887
Nothing will happen
until we have proof of life.

509
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,434
<i>All right, here's your proof of life.
Cut out the girl's tongue.</i>

510
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,562
- <i>No!</i>
- This is Conway.

511
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>- No!</i>
- Please, before you do anything...

512
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,984
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Josh. Zach.

513
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,544
<i>Do you think we care
you know who we are?</i>

514
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,365
<i>No, stop!</i>

515
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,368
I'd like to speak with you,
just for a moment.

516
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,912
I... I have something to say,
but I need Melissa to stop screaming

517
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,414
- so I can hear you.
<i>- No!</i>

518
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:36,627
Can I hear her voice?

519
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,796
We need her voice.

520
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,552
<i>I'm here.
I'm Melissa.</i>

521
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,846
Hi, Melissa.
My name is Will...

522
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
<i>You heard her voice.
Now talk.</i>

523
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,766
<i>Oh, no.</i>

524
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,854
Yes, I...
I've killed a lot of people.

525
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,274
Some of them innocent people.

526
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,987
And every single night...

527
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,656
I haven't even told my wife this...

528
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,075
but every single night,
I have nightmares.

529
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:16,792
I picture my own daughter, Lily,
and my wife...

530
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,046
and my son,
just like you described...

531
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,506
blown away.

532
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,008
Gone.

533
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,470
Now, you could say that I...

534
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,434
I have these demons
because what I did was wrong

535
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,792
and that your cause is righteous.

536
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,350
But I believed
that my cause was righteous, too.

537
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,437
And if I could take it all back...

538
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,189
I wouldn't do it again.

539
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,194
The truth is...

540
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,448
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

541
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,461
Now, the president is right.

542
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,218
We need more time to work on your demands,
but more importantly,

543
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,137
I'm guessing you've never
killed anyone before.

544
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,227
And speaking as someone
who knows what it means to kill,

545
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,062
you owe yourselves more time

546
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,065
before you do something
you can never take back.

547
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,073
Josh?

548
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,496
<i>9:00 a.m.
You have till then.</i>

549
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,707
They've ended the call.

550
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,084
You did
an excellent job, Governor.

551
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,252
Thank you.

552
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,921
<i>We have a recording
of the Situation Room call</i>

553
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,382
<i>released by the captors a short while ago.</i>

554
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,843
<i>Before playing this audio,
we want to warn viewers</i>

555
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,220
<i>that there are sections
that are very disturbing.</i>

556
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,823
<i>You might want to mute the television.</i>

557
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,102
- Where is everybody?
- They all got pulled on the hostage story.

558
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,062
Get 'em back here.

559
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,856
And Maggie Tilden, too.

560
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,401
Transcribe this, right away.

561
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,280
Fifty mile radius
outside of Chattanooga.

562
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,483
- Gas purchase on a stolen credit card.
- One of Masterson's classmates.

563
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,326
Should we just release
their photographs at this point?

564
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,620
I'm getting bombarded with calls.

565
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,996
Well, the governor
used the first names.

566
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,122
Someone's gonna put it together.

567
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,166
- We might as well exploit it.
- Sir.

568
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,836
- George.
- Mr. President.

569
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,716
Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider,
but time is in short supply today.

570
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,679
- I can't. Not to my party.
- The party will survive.

571
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,973
Conway might not, but too bad.
He lied.

572
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,561
If I do this to him, I don't survive.
I'm vilified.

573
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,735
I wanna show you something.

574
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,162
Do you know what this is?

575
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,165
This is your magnet

576
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,043
from the vote count board
when I used to be whip.

577
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,879
There were so many times when

578
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,423
you weren't in the column
I wanted you to be in, George.

579
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,050
And we both know
that I could've forced you

580
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,302
to vote the way
I wanted you to dozens of times,

581
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,888
but I never did.
I held back.

582
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,016
To protect your honor.

583
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,687
And one of the advantages of being whip
is that behind every single member,

584
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,022
behind all of these magnets,

585
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:31,194
was at least one dishonorable thing.

586
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,447
Yours just happens to be
more dishonorable than most.

587
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,160
So I'm putting you
in my column this time, George.

588
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,837
LeAnn told me you were in here.

589
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,674
I'm working on your statements,
in case the worst happens.

590
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,094
It's tense, this building.

591
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,139
You can feel it in the walls.

592
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
I went for a walk earlier.

593
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
It was in the air.

594
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:11,109
People were talking in whispers,
even though there was no reason to.

595
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,196
Or their eyes are glued to their phones.

596
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,534
And there are no children out...

597
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,953
anywhere.

598
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,000
I guess they call it terror for a reason.

599
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,004
Worse than terror.
Dread.

600
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,633
People girding themselves for a tragedy.

601
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,218
Mmm, and it could go the other way.

602
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,387
Hmm.

603
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,891
How are you holding up?

604
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,229
Hannah is minding her children.

605
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,398
I'm minding her.

606
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,359
Her husband really knocked it
out of the ballpark, huh?

607
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,655
Do you think anything he says is genuine?

608
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,908
Doesn't matter, does it?
It worked.

609
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,912
You said once you thought
he was all surface, Conway.

610
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,621
Yeah, a narcissist.

611
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:10,418
But give him a pool to reflect in...
Watch out.

612
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:15,006
- He knows exactly what to do with that.
- Unless he overreaches.

613
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:21,096
Is that what you were hoping?
That he was gonna fuck it up?

614
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,264
Because he's not gonna fuck it up.

615
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,017
He's too smart for that.

616
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,648
"There he soared,
zipping past Big Ben and the London Eye,

617
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,819
over Buckingham Palace
and Piccadilly Circus.

618
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,739
Look at him go."

619
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,281
I'll be right back, Charlie.

620
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,075
<i>...the vigil is especially somber,</i>

621
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,160
<i>but there remains a great deal of hope</i>

622
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,372
<i>after the deadline was extended
earlier this morning.</i>

623
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,208
<i>- Many credit that extension...</i>
- What's the latest?

624
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,461
Progress.
They've narrowed the search zone.

625
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,339
<i>During the call,
Melissa could be heard screaming</i>

626
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,009
<i>as Masterson orders Hawthorne
to, quote, "Cut out..."</i>

627
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,135
Left of the sink.

628
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,553
<i>- That's when Governor Conway stepped in.</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry. You want one?

629
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,679
- No, thank you.
<i>- We're going to play</i>

630
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,140
<i>some of what he said right now.</i>

631
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,183
- Is it your liver?
<i>- Yes, I...</i>

632
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,560
- Clear mind.
<i>- I've killed a lot of people.</i>

633
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,148
<i>Some of them innocent people.</i>

634
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,734
<i>And every...</i>

635
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,819
Oh, why'd you turn it off?

636
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,155
I was there.

637
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,074
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?

638
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,535
How much good press
I'm getting out of this.

639
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,123
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

640
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,417
Come on, tell me.
I want in on the joke.

641
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,672
You think you can get under my skin.

642
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,466
Oh, I got under your skin
the first time we met.

643
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,260
- When? New Year's?
- Mmm-hmm.

644
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,555
I believe I complimented you that night.
But you go ahead,

645
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,267
you tell yourself what you have to
in order to stand a little taller.

646
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,770
I feel sorry for you.

647
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,775
Two years.
That's all you're gonna get in here.

648
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,485
You're not gonna last
any longer than Walker did.

649
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:05,826
And what kills you
is that I'll make a great president.

650
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,079
The kind of president
who'll actually be remembered.

651
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,833
And isn't that worse than dying, Frank?

652
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,669
Being forgotten.

653
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,633
You actually think
you'd make a great president.

654
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,221
Mmm. Today was just a little taste.

655
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,766
99% of this job is in the dark.

656
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,895
I mean, you had
your little moment in the sun today,

657
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,107
but what are you gonna do when you have
to make a thousand decisions

658
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,818
that no one will ever
hear about or appreciate?

659
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,445
I think you're excellent
at running for the president,

660
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,115
but I don't think you're equipped
to actually be one.

661
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,826
Don't be condescending.
I'm the Governor of New York.

662
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,203
Ooh, Albany, really?

663
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,541
You're a pretender, Will.

664
00:38:55,625 --> 00:39:00,130
And if you win,
you'll go from pretender to fraud.

665
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,384
Will?

666
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,472
Uh... I'm putting the kids to bed.

667
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,100
Don't let me keep you.

668
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,201
- Maybe you should send them home.
- No, not yet.

669
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,538
Do you have something else in mind
besides Walleck?

670
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,957
Yes, and I'll need your help.

671
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,626
Charlie?
Have you seen him?

672
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,378
Charlie?

673
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,922
Mommy, look what I found!

674
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,757
Oh, look at those.

675
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,802
Give those back.
Those aren't yours to play with.

676
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,681
- Can I keep them?
- Oh, um, hand them over, Charlie.

677
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,975
- Charles.
- No, you know what?

678
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,268
You should keep them,

679
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,854
because you should get
everything you want in this life.

680
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,566
Um, say thank you.

681
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,694
- Thank you.
- No, thank you

682
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,613
for coming to the White House to visit us.

683
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,615
We should get some rest.
I'll see you at 7:00.

684
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,284
Oh, I'll be up way before then.

685
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,953
- Good night.
- Good night.

686
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,162
Good night.

687
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,335
You need my help how?

688
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,339
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.

689
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,551
I'll need you to make arrangements
as quietly as possible.

690
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,761
All right, I'm on it.

691
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,763
I'll let you know
as soon as I have a location.

692
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,142
Good. Then go home
and get a few hours of sleep.

693
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,020
I can't sleep tonight.

694
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,523
You should try.
We'll need you fresh in the morning.

695
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,123
- Get me the Chairman Joint Chiefs.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

696
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,421
<i>He's on the line, sir.</i>

697
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,009
Mr. Chairman.

698
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,387
When do you wanna reach out
to the White House?

699
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,140
Tomorrow.
I've drafted the email.

700
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,602
- You looked this over?
- Yes. We're okay on the legal front.

701
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,147
But shouldn't we wait
until this crisis is over first?

702
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,233
No. This is perfect timing for us.

703
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,070
Tom's right.
Let's hit him while he's distracted.

704
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,454
How is it?

705
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
Perfect.

706
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,084
Well, you didn't have much
to work with in your fridge.

707
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,628
You need to do some grocery shopping.

708
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,673
- I don't cook a lot.
- Obviously.

709
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,098
- If you have to get back to your kids...
- No, it's fine.

710
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,517
Haley's 16.
She'll call me if she needs anything.

711
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,727
Have they been watching the news?

712
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,647
Yeah...
and they're freaked out by it.

713
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,692
I mean, who isn't?
But they've got thick skin by now.

714
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,070
Handling it a lot better
than some of their friends.

715
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,237
I know a lot of parents

716
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,561
aren't even letting their kids
out of the house tomorrow.

717
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,283
Not even to go to school.

718
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,118
My kids are gonna go, though.

719
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,454
I'm not gonna let these monsters
rule over our lives.

720
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,251
- Thanks for coming over.
- Of course.

721
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,379
I know I'd just be staring
at the ceiling if I tried to sleep.

722
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,132
Well, you have a lot on your shoulders.

723
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:36,929
Yeah, normally, I'd go to a meeting.
I... I just, uh...

724
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,390
You just wanted someone
to take care of you.

725
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,894
And it's nice to take care of someone.

726
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,441
Good morning, Governor.

727
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,831
Your phone.

728
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,170
Hello?

729
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:13,299
We have video of a car at an intersection
near Chatsworth, Georgia.

730
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,593
The bird song,
deep background from the phone call,

731
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,887
puts them in a wooded area.
Southern Blue Ridge.

732
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,015
<i>We started canvassing now.
FBI, state troopers.</i>

733
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,617
The line is open.

734
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,661
Uh, okay.
Where... where's my script?

735
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,787
I'll be doing the talking.

736
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,710
I'll let you know
if I want you to participate.

737
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,416
Sir, if we've established a dialogue

738
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,126
between the kidnappers and the governor,
we should...

739
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,752
Start the call.
