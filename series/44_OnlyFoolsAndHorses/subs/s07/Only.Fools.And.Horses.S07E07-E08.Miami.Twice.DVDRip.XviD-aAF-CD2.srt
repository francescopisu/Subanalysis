What a blinding night, eh, Rodders?

2
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:15,524
They were a nice bunch of blokes.

3
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:18,597
Well, they were absolute 42-carat diamonds.

4
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,074
We was drinking with them all night,

5
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:24,317
never had to put our hands
in our pockets, did we?

6
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,718
What's the matter? What's happened?

7
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,196
- What's the matter?
- It's all gone!

8
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:42,758
They've nicked it - our suitcases,
flight bags, duty frees - the lot!

I mean, we was only in there half an hour!

12
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:56,202
Well, four hours.

13

What's gonna happen?
How we gonna get home?

- Now, Del, don't panic!
- Eh?

15
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,601
Listen, I took the passports
and flight tickets in there with us.

16

Rodney, you are a saint, mate! You are a saint!

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,125
Well done! Where's the money?

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,680
- I left that in the van.
- You plonker, Rodney!

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,764
You told me to! And you told me
to leave the luggage in the back!

20
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:23,240
Why didn't you use your initiative?

21
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:26,323
I didn't even want to go in to that bloody club!

00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,881
All right! Calm down!

Cor, stone me! I don't know...

24
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:36,491
How much money we got between us?

25
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:44,527
- What's that?
- 32 dollars, right?

26
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:47,002
What can we get for 32 dollars?

Hey! You two guys still here? Let me guess -

29
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:58,410
you decided to come back and have
that one for the road with us!

30
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:02,614
No, I wish we had, Rico.
No, we're thinking of going to the police.

31
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:06,404
- Why? You got a problem?
- Yeah, we've been robbed.

32
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:10,489
- You're kidding!
- No, I wish we was!

33
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:13,693
They broke into the van and took everything!

34
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:16,814
Oh, gee, that is too bad!

35
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:22,813
God, I feel so embarrassed!
You just arrive in this country and this happens?

36
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,456
What a welcome!

37
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:29,247
- It's just one of them things.
- What are you guys gonna do?

38
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:36,335
I don't know. We got no money,
no clothes, no duty frees, we got nothing!

39
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:39,137
We'll have to get the police to sort it out.

40
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,210
The cops'll do diddly squat!

41

43
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,694
Maybe he could talk to some
of his friends at the DA's office?

44
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,454
Yeah, first thing in the morning.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,010
Could you do that?
That would be very nice of you.

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,615
- Wouldn't it, Rodders?
- Yeah!

47

In the meantime,
you two guys are coming home with me.

- It belongs to my family.

You see 'em?

And I heard 'em!
Why are you bringing Australians home?

They're two English guys over here
on vacation. They're in the guest suite.

Why are you bringing limeys
into my house?! I hate limeys!

We met 'em at the club.

Wait a minute... What are you doing,
picking up guys in bars?

68

Is there too much air in your Nikes?

00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,226
I saw no similarity whatsoever.

73
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:25,023
He's much taller than me.
He's a thinner guy altogether.

- Tell him, Sal!
- It's true. He looks just like you.

83

Last year I went to the zoo and I saw a camel.

It looked just like your mother, but I didn't
invite it home and put it in the guest suite!

We dress the limey up in your clothes
and take him out to eat in a nice restaurant.

...sometimes during my life I have
doubted that you were my child.

104
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,837
Sometimes I thought
that the hospital had screwed up

105
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:41,966
and given us the baby
of a family from Pittsburgh.

106

you are definitely my son!

Well, it's most probably ridiculous...

169

You don't think that Rico might be...?

170
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,939
What?

171
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,945
- A noofter.
- A noofter? Him?! No!

172
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,865
He's Italian, ain't he?
You can't have an Italian noofter.

173
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,340
It's a well-known medical fact!

174
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,741
But they're all blokes!

175
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:57,463
That's because he's a man's man, ain't he?

176
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,021
I'll tell you what else he is, Rodney.

177
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:05,108
He's a little gold nugget!
Yeah, that's what he is, Rodney!

178
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,744
A little gold nugget!

179
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:24,389
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

180
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,546
- bless you...
- Reverend?

181
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,910
Amen.

182
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:34,388
Raquel, I'm glad I met you. I was going
to phone Derek as soon as the lorry had gone.

183
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:38,788
- Del? Del's in Miami.
- Miami? Oh, dear.

184
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:43,746
Excuse me for asking, but why
are you blessing a Romanian lorry?

185
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,750
I'm blessing the contents. Didn't Derek tell you?

186
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:50,148
No... Has this got something to do with Derek?

187
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,626
Yes, he did a time and motion study

188
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:57,155
of the blessing of the wine
and had the idea of doing it en masse.

189
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,754
Then I distribute it
to churches throughout England.

190
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,352
Oh, hell!

191
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:06,033
- Sorry!
- It's been a real money saver,

192
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,793
especially as Del sells it to us so cheap.

193
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,029
There's just one major problem.

194
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,918
It's turned out to be Romanian Riesling.

195
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,274
Romanian Riesling?

196
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,432
Yes. White wine. The communion wine is red.

197
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,797
- It represents...
...the blood of Christ.

198
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,589
Exactly! Churches are returning their cases daily!

- No, his son and one of the gorillas.

204
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:06,392
What do you reckon, then, Rico?
It fits like a dream, don't it?

205
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,161
Perfect, Del, just perfect.

206
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,919
There's a bloke over there with a camera.

207
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,839

Don't be stupid, Rodney!

246
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,535
It would roll off a fork, wouldn't it?

Fair enough, I ain't been nowhere,

251
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,977
but wherever I have been,
people have taken to me.

and he took to me.

00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:25,257
Yeah, of course. That one is better.

335
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:36,770
Don't be shy. Straddle your weight evenly.
This is your start button.

336
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,534
This is the throttle.
Just remember, the faster you go,

337
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:43,578
the easier it is to stay up. Way to go, fella!

338
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,253
Yeah, cushty!

339
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,899
Here we go!

340
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,341
Look at that baby go!

341
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,857
Lovely, yes! Lovely jubbly!

342
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,456
I think that's far enough now!

343
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,500
- Did he say something?
- I didn't hear a thing.

344
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:10,459
Rico! The steering wheel's stuck!

345
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,418
The steering wheel is stuck!

346
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:23,899
Now the throttle's stuck!
Rico! I've got an iffy throttle!

347
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,453
He's going a long way out!

348
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,900
- Yeah, but he's enjoying himself.
- I know.

349
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,215
I'm just saying he's going a long way out.

350
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:38,254
Where are the brakes
on this bloody thing?! Gordon Bennett!

351
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:40,416
What a guy, huh?

352
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:43,861
- Yeah, he's certainly surprised me.
- Why's that?

353
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:47,177
Well, he can't even swim!

354
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:50,144
He said he had a certificate for swimming!

355
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:53,582
He has, but it ain't his.

356
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:56,899
Help!

357
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,058
Help!

358
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:05,539
(PILOT) We've begun our descent into Miami,
25 miles off the coast of Florida.

359
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:09,826
We'll soon be in Miami. Let's hope
it's better than Washington!

360
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:11,546
I liked Washington.

361
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,506
Not much of a beach though, was there?

362
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:17,502
We've been all down the east coast of America

363
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:22,060
- and you've done nothing but moan!
- I didn't moan in Atlantic City.

364
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,221
You was too busy gambling in the casinos!

365
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,902
- That's funny!
- What is?

366
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,584
There's a bloke on one of them ski-jets.

367
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,709
- So what?
- We're 25 miles off the coast!

368
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,941
He must know what he's doing.

369
00:25:56,552 --> 00:26:01,263
(RICO) I'm calling to say that our
meeting can go ahead as scheduled.

370

Your... meeting... with... my... father
can... go... ahead...

372
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:12,149
...as planned.

373
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,305
Planned.

374
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:18,434
Si... Gracias. I look forward to meeting you.

375
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,586
Lovely jubbly!

376

"Lovely jubbly!"

377
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:34,834
Hi. How are you doing?

378
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:39,354
Fine. I just thought that might be news of Del.

379
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:44,466
No. I'll let you know if I hear anything.

380
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:49,629
You're not worried, are you?

381
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:53,473
No! It's just that he left
the beach at 11.00 this morning

382
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:55,629
and it's now 8.30 at night.

383
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,517
Your brother's one hell of a fun guy!

384
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:02,115
But can you have fun on a jet-ski
for nine and a half hours?

385
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,558
Del can! I bet he's in a nightclub
in Key West with some senorita.

386
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,631
He's wearing swimming trunks.

387
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,759
- They all do on Key West!
- Oh, it's like that, is it?

388
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,150
I see the phones are working again.

389
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,789
- No.
- I thought I saw you...

390
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:25,079
- It's a private line for business.
- Oh, I see.

391
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:29,314
How come that one's working
when all the others in the area are out?

392
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,835
Search me.

393
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:34,562
Could I use that phone for a minute?

394
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,998
No. I'm expecting
a very important business call.

395
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:40,278
Right. I just wanted to phone home

396
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,753
and tell 'em where we were
in case they was worried.

397
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,915
They don't need to worry, Rod. You're with us.

398
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:53,232
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

399
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:57,443
Well, I'll be in me room. If you hear anything...

400
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:00,914
You'll be the first to know. Goodnight.

401
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:13,838
Lurch is bringing the car round the front.

402
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:17,078
The tall one's starting to ask questions.

403
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:23,197
Looks like tomorrow we take him for a drive
and put him out of his misery.

(DOORBELL CHIMES)

406
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:37,679
Good evening, sir.

407
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,442
Officer, is there any news of my father?

408
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:43,566
Yes, sir, and I'm afraid it's bad news.

409
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:47,603
Oh, God! Good God, no!

410
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,919
We fished him out three hours ago.

411
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:51,727
He's dead?

412
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:53,925
No, he's alive and well.

413
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,162
- What?
- That's what I mean by bad news.

414
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,639
See, we know what the plan was, Rico.

415
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,770
Daddy doesn't cherish spending
the rest of his life in the pen,

416
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:09,686
so he takes a jet-ski to a friendly yacht
and sails off into the sunset.

417
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:12,411
It couldn't work, Rico, for two reasons.

418
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,880
One - we're watching his every move.

419
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:18,522
We saw him leave,
then the coastguard had him on radar.

420
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:21,490
Two - he ran out of gas 35 miles off Cuba.

421
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:32,165
Am I glad to be back, Rico!

422
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,722
It was horrible out there!

423
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:39,365
I thought I was a goner! I don't
know what would have happened to me

424
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:42,332
if that police helicopter hadn't found me!

425
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:47,046
Why don't you go in the kitchen
and get yourself something to eat?

426
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,206
Thanks.

427
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,333
I could murder a pina colada!

428
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:57,569
Something's happened to his voice -
he sounds Australian.

429
00:29:57,736 --> 00:30:01,046
We think it might be salt
on the vocal chords.

430
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,370
Oh, rest assured, officer, I got
something for his throat! Goodnight!

431
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:16,085
You limey turkey!
What have I got to do to get rid of you?

432
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:19,657
How much do I owe you?

433
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,810
They're with Mickey Pearce on the last round.

434
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,969
- You're joking!
- No, I'm not!

435
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,652
- You're worrying about nothing!
- They've been gone five days

436
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:36,858
and we haven't heard from them,
and you call that "nothing"?

437
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,853
I bet there's a simple explanation for it.

438
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,979
Maybe Dave's gone down to Brazil
to have a look at the forest.

439
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,449
You can't get more simple than that!

440
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,651
I mean, just look at that telly, Sid.
It's all bad news.

441
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:54,130
You're right. Nothing but bad news.

442
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:58,533
- It's all tragedies and disasters.
- Yeah, it's all gloom and doom.

443
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:02,661
I shouldn't have it on during happy hour really.

444
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:05,211
Funny about Del and Rodney, innit?

445
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:08,294
- They'll turn up sooner or later.
- Yeah.

446
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:13,457
I just hope the police catch whoever did it.
I must be off. Cheers, Mike.

Cheers, mate. Stay lucky!

448
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:20,978
- Have you heard from Cassandra?
- Yes, she's as worried as you are.

449
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:24,500
There's nothing to worry about!
A few years back,

450
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:28,577
my brother went to Portugal
and didn't contact us for three months.

451
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:32,260
His wife rang Interpol, my mum was going mad,

452
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:35,735
- but he turned up safe and sound.
- Where had he been?

453
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:39,181
Shacked up with some German tart.

454
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:43,419
- Shut up, there's a good boy!
- All right, so he was out of order,

455
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:45,781
but at least he weren't injured!

456
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,462
Which is more than people will say
about you if you don't shut it!

457

I've known Del a lot longer than you,

458
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:57,305
and he can be a bit forgetful,
especially if he's enjoying himself.

459
00:31:57,467 --> 00:32:00,265
He's probably having the time of his life...

460

I'm not saying the right things, am I?

461
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:07,186
- No, you're not.
- Mickey's more comforting than you!

His web of vice and corruption
has spread across America,

466
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:26,149

dangerous criminal since Al Capone.

- Del booked the tickets.

510
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,649
Del? No, he couldn't. He knew
I was in Eastbourne that week.

I suppose he thought...
What do you mean, he knew?

I told him about it over lunch,

but you didn't tell me, did you?

- But you planned it!

come away with me on this holiday!

to Miami, He won't find me."

00:49:57,571 --> 00:50:01,610
- Sit down there.
- Just listen to me.

669
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:07,244
You know Rico, Salvatore and them
other guys? They're all Mafioso!

670
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:11,451
Remember you said you thought
you saw a bloke what looked like me?

671
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:14,888
Well, there IS one!
He's got a room down there!

672
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:19,365
His name's Don Occhetti
and he is the boss.

673
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:24,163
I'm telling you, Rodney,
this is Marlon Brambo time!

674
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:28,612
Yes! I just read a newspaper
down there.

675
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:32,164
It's all about him!
This Don, he's up for trial.

676
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:34,564
It looks like
he's well in the frame,

677
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:38,045
and he's gonna spend the rest
of his life in the nick!

678
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:42,811
- What for?
- Drug-running, kidnapping,

679
00:50:42,975 --> 00:50:46,365
and three - you count 'em -
three murders!

680
00:50:46,535 --> 00:50:51,929
That is what all this has been
about, Rodney, don't you understand?

681
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:54,894
They've been trying to kill ME!

682
00:50:55,056 --> 00:50:59,926
Think about it - that accidental
stray bullet that whacked the chair,

683
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:05,535
the iffy ski-boat ride, eh?
Don't you see? If I go for a burton,

684
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:10,294
this Donald-whatever-his-name-is
won't stand trial and he goes free!

685
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:14,497
Aren't you just letting
your imagination run away with you?

686
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:18,447
I wish I was, Rodney, I wish I was!
Look at that, pal. Go on!

687
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,610
I've been down there

688
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:25,773
and just had a little tete-a-tete
with two Colombian drug barons!

689
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:29,614
Bloody hell, Del! He's a Mafia boss!

690
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,216
That's what I've been trying
to tell ya. Look at it!

691
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,258
- Oh, cosmic!
- Hmm?

692
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,778
Cos-bloody-mic!
I just roughed him up!

693
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:44,490
I have just roughed up a Mafia boss!

694
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,652
I called him a git!

695
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,451
- I called a Mafia boss...
- Pull yourself together!

696
00:51:50,622 --> 00:51:51,941
...a git!

697
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:56,414
These are not the sort of people
you wanna spend your holidays with!

698
00:51:56,582 --> 00:52:00,462
Rico can forget that present
we was gonna buy him!

699
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:02,693
- Let's get outta here!
- How?

700
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:06,060
- They're all downstairs!
- We'll go out the window!

701
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,977
Quick before I wake up with
a bloody horse's head on me pillow!

702
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,383
You first!

703
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,574
Go on!

704
00:52:36,026 --> 00:52:37,664
Look at this!

705
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:56,423
- Mucho... very much!
- Hasta la vista!

706
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:14,026
Yeah. Send Rico up to me.
Tell him I want to talk to him.

707
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,981
There's something sharp up there!

708
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:52,464
How the hell did this happen?

709
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,944
I don't know, Pop.
The last time I saw it, it was fine.

710
00:53:56,114 --> 00:53:58,184
Leave it. I'll get Lurch to do it.

711
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:01,869
- OK.
- Well, the Colombians seem happy.

712
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:06,426
Well, maybe they won't be so happy
after we've had our meeting.

713
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:09,063
- Show 'em up, Rico.
- Show 'em up?

714
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:11,465
- They just left!
- Left?

715
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:14,388
What the hell did they come all this way for

716
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:17,024
and then leave without talking to me?!

717
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:22,145
But I brought them in and...
How did you get changed so quickly?

718
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:25,592
I've worn it all morning. I've been working out.

719
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:28,225
Oh, God! The limey!

720
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:38,152
I'm in court tomorrow morning!

721
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:40,513
Rico!

722
00:54:44,598 --> 00:54:49,719
- Do something, you stupid jerk!
- Don't worry, we'll get 'em back.

723
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,234
Are you enjoying the ride, boys?

724
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:13,995
Oh, yes, lovely, Miss Daisy!

725
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:17,837
- I don't believe this!
- This is supposed to be a getaway!

726
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:21,074
At this rate, we'll be done for kerb crawling!

727
00:55:30,603 --> 00:55:34,960
- This is about as far as I go.
- Well, thanks for the lift.

728
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:38,636
Have a nice trip back to Australia!

729
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:42,683
- We're not Aussies, we're English!
- Leave it. She's old!

730
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:11,401
- (RICO) Sure it was them?
- Who else is running around here

731
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:14,206
dressed like Jimmy Connors?

732
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:23,077
Raquel, where have you been?

733
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:25,239
I've been to Royal Ascot (!)

734
00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:28,639
- Where do you think I've been?
- Cassandra phoned.

735
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:32,324
- She's spoken with Rodney.
- Well, where are they?

736
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,878
They're in a millionaire's mansion.

737
00:56:35,049 --> 00:56:39,042
A tropical storm knocked the phones
out so they couldn't call.

738
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:42,600
- When are they coming home?
- They fly home tomorrow.

739
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,647
You can stop worrying.

740
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,688
They're both safe and sound!

741
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,526
Come on, Rodney! Where's your stamina?

742
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:09,927
Bloody hell!

743
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:13,005
Help me out of here, Rodney!

744
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:15,289
- Come here!
- I can't!

745
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:16,966
Come on!

746
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:25,648
Gordon Bennett! What is that stuff anyway?

747
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:29,853
I think it's water hyacinth. I read
about it in my Greenpeace magazine.

748
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:32,403
Why's it floating on the water?

749
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:37,933
That's what it does. It grows on the water.
We must be in the Everglades.

750
00:57:39,535 --> 00:57:43,050
Everglades? It looks more like a swamp to me!

751
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:45,366
Well, it is a swa...

752
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:48,695
Don't matter.

753
00:57:51,776 --> 00:57:56,248
Rodney, just get me home, will ya?
Back to England's pleasant land

754
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:59,056
and those dark, volcanic mills!

755
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:01,412
Yeah.

756
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:04,934
Look, Del, let's just have a rest, eh?

757
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:09,057
We're safe enough.
Nobody could find us in here.

758
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:18,647
Look at me! Me hands are
all bleeding, me clothes are torn,

759
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:20,810
me arse is soaking wet!

760
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:24,892
- And you're still whining!
- Yes! It's all right for you!

761
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:27,893
If I get piles, you can have half of 'em!

762
00:58:52,622 --> 00:58:54,817
Del Boy...

763
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:58,134
Shut up, Rodney!
You're getting on my nerves!

764
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:01,500
I want you to do something for me, Derek.

765
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,099
I want you to stand up

766
00:59:05,263 --> 00:59:09,177
and very slowly walk away.

767
00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:14,334
What is this? "Simple Simon Says"?

768
00:59:14,504 --> 00:59:17,815
Very slowly walk away, Del.

769
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:21,216
We don't want to alarm it.

770
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:27,257
- Alarm what?
- That thing behind us.

771
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,903
That thing?

772
00:59:41,347 --> 00:59:44,419
- That was a crocodile, Rodney!
- No, it weren't.

773
00:59:44,587 --> 00:59:48,740
I can recognise a crocodile.
I've seen enough Tarzan films!

774
00:59:54,788 --> 00:59:58,224
- That was an alligator.
- It's the same thing, innit?

775
00:59:58,388 --> 01:00:03,668
No, they look alike and they're from
the same family, but biologically...

776
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,706
- Do they eat ya?
- Yeah.

777
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,860
It's the same thing, then!

778
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:10,146
Who the hell let it out?!

779
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,586
No, they live here in the Everglades.

780
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:19,104
"They"? Do you mean to say
there's more than one of 'em?

781
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,343
Yeah, but don't panic!

782
01:00:22,511 --> 01:00:27,062
It's very rare to see them during the day.
They're a nocturnal animal.

783
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:30,223
Are you trying to tell me that come teatime,

784
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:32,860
there'll be millions of the gits?!

785
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:35,624
Yeah.

786
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:41,421
I just don't believe it!

787
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:44,061
I've got to be honest with you, Rodney,

788
01:00:44,233 --> 01:00:48,784
I'm beginning to wish that I hadn't
come on this holiday with you!

789
01:00:48,953 --> 01:00:50,944
Don't you blame me!

790
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:54,265
I did not invite you, Derek, you invited yourself!

791
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:57,028
(DRONING ENGINE)

792
01:00:57,194 --> 01:00:59,150
Listen to that!

793
01:01:04,195 --> 01:01:07,232
(RODNEY) It's a boat! We're saved!

794
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:10,387
Get down, Rodney! It could be the Mafia!

795
01:01:10,555 --> 01:01:12,706
What would they be doing on a boat?

796
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:15,265
Water-skiing (!) What do you think?

797
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,673
Look, Marlene, an eagle!

798
01:01:22,837 --> 01:01:25,226
That's not an eagle, it's a heron!

799
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:28,070
Well, it's a big bird, anyway!

800
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:33,232
- Uncle Rodney!
- Listen to him! Uncle Rodney (!)

801
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,912
The imagination these kids have!

802
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,354
Yes, right. Let's take some photographs.

803
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,718
Marlene... Just for a moment there,
I thought I saw...

804
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,353
Gordon Bennett!

805
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,991
It's Del and Rodney!

806
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,196
Ooh-ooh! Del!

807
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,592
- Boycie!
- Get over here, quick!

808
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:08,911
What are YOU doing here?

809
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:14,474
I forgot to kiss you goodbye
at Gatwick! Get that boat over here!

810
01:02:14,642 --> 01:02:17,998
Wayne, get over there!

811
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:27,480
All right, Del?

812
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,032
Triffic, sweetheart (!)

813
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:37,275
- Come on, Rodders! Let's go!
- You smell like a vegetarian's fart!

814
01:02:37,444 --> 01:02:42,518
- At least I haven't been burgled!
- It's a joke! Now, let's get going!

815
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,561
Right, Wayne. Let's go!

816
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:55,277
Rico, please consider your actions carefully

817
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:58,165
before you do anything you might regret!

818
01:02:58,326 --> 01:03:00,760
OK, I'll consider it!

819
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:02,723
(DEL) Duck!
(BOYCIE) Why?

820
01:03:02,886 --> 01:03:04,683
- (GUNSHOT)
- (DEL) That!

821
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:06,438
(BOYCIE) Get a move on!

822
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:19,238
Did you hear that, Curtis? Some
jerk's out there loosing off lead!

823
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:26,679
(BOYCIE) Everything was going well.
We were having a lovely holiday,

824
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:31,081
then THEY turn up, and within 15 seconds,
some sod's shooting at us!

825
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:35,481
(MARLENE) You've done nothing
but moan since we left Washington!

826
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:38,801
(BOYCIE) Get that bloody boat in,
for Gawd's sake!

827
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:52,565
Rodney, hang about a minute.

828
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:07,010
Rodney, let's go home.

829
01:04:07,172 --> 01:04:10,529
Del, our plane don't leave till tomorrow night.

830
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:13,127
I know, but we can sleep at the airport.

831
01:04:13,293 --> 01:04:16,888
At least we'll be that much closer
to dear old England!

832
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,442
Give us a lift to the airport, Boycie!

833
01:04:19,613 --> 01:04:23,084
