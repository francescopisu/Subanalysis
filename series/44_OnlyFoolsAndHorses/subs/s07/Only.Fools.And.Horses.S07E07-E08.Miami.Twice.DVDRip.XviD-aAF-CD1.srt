- What's that?

128
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,086
Remember when you worked for me,
you joined the pension scheme?

129
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,363
They've come up with your repayments.

130
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:56,920
I talked to the insurance company,
and if you like, you can keep the policy open.

131
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,999

That's really nice of you.
I'll take you up on that offer!

Let's see. P935 invested in a policy
attracting a gross annual...

138

- What about the future?

139
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,642
What future? I work for Del.

140
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,520
I don't quite understand, Mr Trotter.

141
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,678
Let me try to explain.

142
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:41,446
What would you do if you had an extra ten
or twenty thousand pounds a year coming in?

143
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:45,600
Build a new youth club?
Buy a minibus for the old folks' outings?

144
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:49,077
I'm not used to decisions of that magnitude.

145
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:55,004
Well, I've come up with an idea that can
revolutionise your fund-raising mechanism.

146
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,284
- What do you put in there?
- Communion wine.

147
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,439
Before it goes in, it's not communion wine?

148
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:05,520
- Not until I bless it.
- Till you bless it, exactly!

149
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,565
How long does it take to bless it?

150
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:12,402
- Two or three minutes.
- Let's call it three minutes.

151
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:16,560
That's three minutes, three times
a day. Three threes are nine.

152
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:23,326
Nine minutes a day, seven days a week -
'cause I know you blokes work on Sundays!

153
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:27,162
That's about one hour a week, times 52.

154
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:32,242
That works out about two days a year
that you lose just blessing wine,

155
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:36,400
and that's not including the trip
to Oddbins to pick it up.

156
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:40,924
I reckon you lose about one week
every year just blessing wine.

157
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:44,363
- Possibly.
- No, positively!

158
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:50,841
Think of the clergymen all over the country
who are also losing one week every year!

159
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,364
Cor, dear! We must be losing
months and months of vicar hours!

160
00:10:55,527 --> 00:11:00,521
Think of all the good works
you could do with them lost months.

161
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,678
I never thought of it like that.

162
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,884
I have and it's been bothering me!

163
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:11,201
Sit down, your reverence.
Sit down and let me explain.

164
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:17,158
I have worked out a way in which I can
give you back that precious quality, time.

165
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:20,603
- How?
- Are you ready for this?

- Yes.

171
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,602
He's shipping in
this new range of Romanian wine.

172
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,998
- Romanian wine?
- It's gonna be all the rage.

173

They drive it from Tilbury to here,
where you will bless it by the lorryload.

174
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:55,478
Then we'll ship it
to churches and cathedrals all over the country.

182
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,359
Yes, it can save time, and time is money!

183

It must be a sign or something!

189

I'll let you think about it.

You don't live at Del's all the time.
We spend weekends together.

326
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:56,757
Oh, yeah, yeah. We spend weekends together.

327
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:01,557
Don't start. We discussed all our problems
with the Relate counsellor.

328
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:06,198
Remember what she said
after she stopped laughing?

329
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:10,645
She advised us to go slowly
and just spend weekends together at first.

330
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:14,561
- You must be joking!
- Well, the offer still holds.

331
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,719
It's up to you.
Now, could we change the subject?

332
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,878
Yes, sorry!

333
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:25,639
How are things at the bank?
Heard anything about your promotion?

334
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:29,083
Not yet, but I'm definitely on the shortlist.

335
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:33,001
I've been invited to the company's
seminar in Eastbourne.

336
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,237
A seminar in Eastbourne (!)

337
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:37,398
Sorry.

338
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:44,404
- It's important, this seminar?
- It's where the final interviews will be held.

339
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:49,357
- Well... here's to your future.
- OURS.

340
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:54,681
- Yeah.
- Don't look like that! Please?

341
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:59,000
This is supposed to be a happy occasion.

342
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,806
That's just it! Everybody's celebrating!

343
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,527
Boycie and Marlene are off to the States,

344
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:07,440
Del and Raquel have christened the chavie.

345
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,518
That could be us in a while.

346
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,279
What, a baby?

347
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:18,521
No, I meant we could go to America.
It's been an ambition of mine.

348
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:21,884
Once I get my promotion,
we could put some money aside

349
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,800
and have a holiday in California or Florida.

350
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,566
Yeah? When?

351
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,206
A couple of years.

352
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,646
Cosmic!

353
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:41,685
(TRIG) There are thousands of trees
in the world!

354
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,644
It is not just a bunch of trees!

355
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:47,083
It's the Brazilian rainforest,
the lungs of the world!

356
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:50,364
They are destroying it
at the rate of 25 acres a day!

357
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:52,916
- Where is that, exactly?
- Huh?

358
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,999
Where is the Brazilian rainforest?

359
00:24:56,167 --> 00:25:00,240
It's outside Luton!
Where do you think?! It's in Brazil!

360
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:07,244
Albert, there you are! I've booked you
a front row seat at the launderama!

361
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:10,319
Away you go. Rodney, I want a word with you.

362
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:14,799
Give us a decaffeinated cappuccino
and a jam doughnut, Sid.

363
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:20,519
He's on about that bleedin' rainforest again.
That's the fourth lecture this week!

364
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,996
Well, he's worried about our world.

365
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:26,477
It wouldn't hurt you to care
a bit more - look at that!

366
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:30,720
It's fossil fuels. People don't
realise what damage they're doing.

367
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:35,881
I don't have none of them
in my house. I use gas and oil.

368
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,000
- Trig, they ARE fossil fuels.
- Are they?

369
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,239
Well, I'll switch to coal in future.

370
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:46,046
No! Coal is the same!

371
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:49,995
I had a coal burner fitted.
It's not as dear as you think.

372
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,317
Put it on Rodney's slate.

373
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:56,162
(RODNEY) I don't know
how many bloody trees there are, Trig!

374
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:59,876
Rodders, leave it out!
You'll never turn this lot "green"

375
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:03,244
as long as you've got a hole in your ozone!

376
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:07,685
I've got some exciting news
to tell you in private. Come here.

377
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,838
Private, please! Thank you.

378
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:15,035
I give up on you two!
It's so frustrating trying to explain

379
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,402
what is happening on this planet!

380
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,683
It gives me the hump an' all!

381
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:23,999
They are more concerned
with a postcard from Boycie and Marlene!

382
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,842
Gawd, dear! We had one
this morning! It's a lovely hotel.

383
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,998
Del!

384
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,727
So what's this exciting news?

385
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:37,085
Well, I went down the bank
to pay in your cheque.

386
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:41,240
I'd have gone earlier, but I've been having
trouble with me wine deal. Thanks, Sid.

387
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,001
- So you have paid it in?
- Of course I have!

388
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:48,558
You've got to look after that money.
Don't go sending it off to Sting!

389
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:54,677
Anyway, when I was down there,
I bumped into Cassandra and we went for lunch.

390
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,600
While I was having lunch, I had this great idea.

391
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:00,406
I know you like to travel...

392
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,603
I am not going to Romania!

393
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,282
- Your wine shipment's got problems.
- Who said that?!

394
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:11,521
Raquel said you had a call from Bucharest
that made you go pale and sweaty.

395
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:16,078
It's nothing I can't handle,
just a hiccup with the old translation.

396
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:19,080
Anyway, this idea was for you and Cassandra.

397
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:22,557
We was talking about Boycie
and Marlene's holiday.

398
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:27,164
Now, it worked out that Cassandra
would love to go to America.

399
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:32,116
On the way here, I called in
to see Alex the travel agent.

400
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,484
He has got a once-in-a-lifetime offer!

401
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,877
It's practically a giveaway!

402
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,564
Return tickets to Miami, 250 smackeroonies!

403
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:47,039
Well, that's a monkey before
you got a bed for the night, innit?

404
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:52,076
No! Here's the cherry on top
of the cake - two go for the price of one!

405
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:58,277
Think about it, Rodney - you and Cassandra
spending a week on Miami Beach!

406
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:02,235
Miami... Nah, I could never afford it.

407
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:07,242
'Course you can afford it! You've got
your Maxwell money, haven't ya?

408
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:11,366
- Me what?
- Maxwell, your pension money.

409
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,520
Miami...? Two for the price of one?

410
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:21,919
Rodney, just think about it -
she'll love it, I know that.

411
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:26,922
Imagine how she'll feel when you
announce your holiday of a lifetime!

412
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:30,443
She'll be all over you like a rash!

413
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:33,963
Is that a brilliant idea or just wonderful?

414
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:37,682
It's a cosmic idea!

415
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:40,919
- Would you give me the time off?
- Of course!

416
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,998
Ace! But what about Cassy?

417
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:48,560
The bank owe her three weeks' holiday -
she told me. You're off and running, bruv!

418
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,561
Yeah? I'd better go and phone her
and make sure it's all right.

419
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:57,357
No, don't phone her. Sit down there.

420
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,518
You take her out for dinner,

421
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:03,600
and when you get to the old coffee
and the Grand "Monier" stakes,

422
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,998
you throw the tickets
down on the table and you say,

423
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:12,400
"Darling, I am taking you to Miami."
You'll knock her bandy!

424
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:16,958
Yeah! I'd better get down
that travel agent's a bit sharpish!

425
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:19,118
No, no, don't go down there.

426
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:21,881
Save the shoe leather, Rodney,

427
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:25,278
'cause you see, I got them for you!

428
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,526
Derek, you are a diamond!

429
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:32,360
How did you know I wanted them?

430
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:36,964
Even a plonker like you
wouldn't turn your nose up at a deal like this!

431
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:40,915
I don't know what I'd do without you!
I'd never have thought...

432
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:43,999
How did you afford it? I thought you were skint.

433
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,601
I am. I cashed one of your cheques.

434
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:50,806
- You took money out of my account?
- Don't you dare thank me!

435
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:56,677
It was nothing.
I can forge your signature as easy as that!

436
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,679
(TV ON)

437
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:07,527
- All right?
- Lovely, son.

438
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:13,478
- Where is everyone?
- Little 'un's in his cot, Raquel's cooking,

439
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:18,562
Rodney's taken Cassandra to dinner.
He's gonna tell her about Miami.

440
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:22,720
- I'd love to be there and see her face!
- So would I!

441
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,242
'Ere, look. Oi! Oi!

442
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,045
(TV OFF)

443
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,686
Any calls for me?

444
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,917
- Calls?
- Has the telephone rung

445
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,397
- and a voice asked for me?
- Not that I'm aware of.

446
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:41,119
- Thank God for that!
- Talking about God, I saw a funny thing today.

447
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:45,121
I was walking past the church
where we held the christening,

448
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,359
and there was a big articulated lorry outside.

449
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:53,555
There was some sort of German writing
on the side, and the back doors were open.

450
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,843
Full of cases of wine, it was.

451
00:30:56,927 --> 00:31:00,124
And that vicar,
the one what christened Damien,

452
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:05,998
he was making the sign of the cross
and saying a prayer to this lorry.

453
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,842
Funny old world, innit, eh? Listen to me.

454
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:14,205
Anyone phones or calls round
asking for me, I'm not in, all right?

455
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:18,042
Does "anyone" mean people
with Romanian accents?

456
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,720
Hello, sweetheart.

457
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:23,357
No, I didn't mean people
with Romanian accents.

458
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:28,601
I just thought I ought to maintain
a bit of a low profile for a while.

459
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,201
I think I'll take a look at Damien.

460
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,837
You dare! It's taken me
over an hour to get him to sleep!

461
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:40,161
All right. I'll make meself a Singapore Sling
to unwind, and take a hot bath.

462
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:41,726
(DOOR SLAMS)

463
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,924
- Rodney's back.
- (DEL) All right, Rodders?

464
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:49,126
- What does Cassandra say?
- I'm going to bed!

465
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:54,122
- Everything all right, bruv?
- Brilliant, Del! Bloody brilliant!

466
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,120
Cassandra cannot come to Miami with me!

467
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:59,084
- (DEL) Eh?
- Why not?

468
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:02,398
- Because she is busy that week!
- Doing what?

469
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,765
She has to attend the bank's
seminar in bloody Eastbourne!

470
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:14,277
She is giving up a trip to Miami for some crappy
interview so she can become an executive!

471
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:17,007
She should get her priorities right!

472
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:21,240
- Let's be fair about this.
- Let's be fair, Rodney.

473
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,841
These interviews are very important.

474
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:28,319
Five years of college
and evening school have led to this seminar.

475
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:32,241
You can't expect her
to risk her future for a week in the sun.

476
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,716
It's not that. It's just my luck -

477
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:40,166
any other week would have been fine
but, no, it had to be that week!

478
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:43,637
I know it's tough, but it's just the way it goes.

479
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:46,367
Well, for me it is, yeah.

480
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:50,236
- See you in the morning.
- Yeah, goodnight, bruv.

481
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:54,281
Dear, oh, dear, oh, Lord.

482
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:58,406
That's a bit of a body blow, innit? There you are.

483
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:01,035
Yeah, he was looking forward to that.

484
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,801
He should have phoned Cassandra first.

485
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,958

00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:18,756
Rodney, that's all different now.
That was in the past.

651
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:23,478
I'm a changed man, see?
I'm a married man with a baby!

652
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:28,198
I've got a baby,
and that's the reason why I've changed -

653
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,961
because I have got a son whom I cherish.

654
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,561
(RAQUEL SHOUTS) Darling, I'm coming!

655
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,958
And there's the mother of my son
whom cherishes me!

656
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:41,518
(RAQUEL) Don't break your back,
Trotter, I'll deal with him (!)

657
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:44,201
Thank you, sweetheart! Thank you.

658
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:51,165
Come on, Rodney, you're judging me
by a few misguided incidents, that's all!

659
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,397
I've told you, I'm changed now!

660
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:56,320
Come on! You want to go to Miami, don't ya?

661
00:44:56,487 --> 00:45:03,199
Of course I want to go,
but this time I want it to be... sensible.

662
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,005
Sensible?

663
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:09,683
'Course you do! I'm sensible!
Sensible's my middle name!

664
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:14,159
- (RAQUEL) Will you get me a nappy?
- Of course, sweetheart!

665
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,841
See? See that?

666
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:20,278
Look, Rodney...

667
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:28,286
I mean, look, all I want to do
is just sit on a beach and relax.

668
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,119
Same here.

669
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,723
Well, they've got
some blinding beaches in Miami!

670
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:37,277
- Mmm...
- Yeah...

671
00:45:37,447 --> 00:45:41,486
And they've got
some fantastic art museums in Miami.

672
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:43,365
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

673
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:45,836
I wouldn't mind some of that.

674
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:51,320
And you can have it, Cinders!
All you've got to do is say the magic words!

675
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,957
How are you going to swing it with Raquel?

676
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,277
I've already done it. I told...

677
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:04,884
(HUSHED) I told her. I told her straight.

678
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:09,199
I said, "I wanna go to Miami with Rodney.
You can like it or lump it.

679
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,200
"Pick the bones out of that, darling!"

680
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,916
- (RAQUEL) Derek!
- Coming, sweetheart!

681
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:20,603
Come on! You and me, eh?
What do you say? Yeah? Yeah?

682
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:23,565
- Eh?
- Well...

683
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:27,879
Come on! Say the magic words, Rodney!

684
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:31,676
- Yeah, all right, then.
- Yes!

685
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:36,238
Good boy! That's it, you see?
You know it makes sense!

686
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,037
Where's that nappy?

687
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:45,327
We're older now, ain't we?
We can appreciate the finer things in life.

688
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:47,478
What? Not half!

689
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:49,638
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.

690
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,798
Thanks!

692

I've got another word - debonair.

693
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,158
Yeah, yeah. That's a good word!

694
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,966
We're beginning to think alike, bruv!

- (RAQUEL YELLS) Derek!
- Coming! I'm on me way!

696
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:10,886

Good job I kept them, wasn't it?

699
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,283
- Have you seen it, Rodders?
- Seen what?

700
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:37,359
You know - our plane!

701
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:40,325
It's only a jumbo jet!

702
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:43,877
Well, they usually are. This is transatlantic.

703
00:47:44,047 --> 00:47:45,924
Yeah. Transatlantic!

- Come on, Rodders, that's us!

706
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:58,680
- There's no hurry!
- Yes, there is! Come on!

707
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:03,398
The sooner we're on the plane,
the sooner old Biggles can take off!

708
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:13,641
Excuse me! What's your game, pal?
Come on, there's no rush!

709
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,038
Blimey, anybody would think
he owned the plane!

713
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:41,361
- Done what?
- Eh?

714
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:44,439
- Done what?
- Joined the glitterati!

The glitterati?

Eh?

717
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:50,203

Eh?

00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:56,759
- Sorry. What?
- What do you mean, joined the glitterati?

Well, we have, ain't we?
We're transatlantic people now.

721

No more of that Costa Del Sewage for us, bruv.

722
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:07,437
- We're in the big time now!
- I suppose so.

723
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:12,158
Del, when we land in Miami,
before we go to any of the bars,

724
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:16,684
we gotta sort ourselves out
some transport and accommodation.

725
00:49:16,847 --> 00:49:22,365
It's all taken care of. Alex, the travel agent,
faxed one of his people in the States.

726
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,837
So we're all fixed up! Ace!

727
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:29,886
I'll pay Alex when I get back.
I'll do it on me credit card.

728
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:32,402
- I've already done it.
- Good.

729
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,719
- What, on my credit card?
- Yeah.

730
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,560
That's what you were gonna do, wasn't it?

731
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,046
Yeah.

732
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:43,880
I've saved you the bother, bruvver!

733
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,722
This is your holiday
and I don't want nothing to mar it.

734
00:49:47,887 --> 00:49:49,525
Thanks.

735
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,326
We're gonna live it up a little, ain't we?

736
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:55,957
Yes, but there are two kinds
of living it up, Del -

737
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,199
enjoying the freedom from the stresses of work,

738
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:04,282
filling the mind with new sights
and sounds, experiencing local cuisine,

739
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:08,520
even indulging in the gifts
of nature such as the sea and the sun.

740
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:12,362
- And then there's your kind!
- What exactly do you...?

741
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:14,643
There will be no women on this trip!

742
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:18,083
Can you be more pacific?

743
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:22,081
This holiday is not going
to be another Benidorm Revisited.

744
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:26,798
If I see just one bra hanging off
our car aerial, I'm out of there!

745
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:31,961
I'm not going to do anything like that!
I would never have even thought of it!

746
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:37,838
I don't know what goes on
in that mind of yours, you dirty little devil!

747
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:47,319
I'm gonna have a little nap.

he's booked a car for us with you.

- OK. You guys on vacation?
- Yeah, a week's holiday.

from Australia for a week?

No, we are English.

Alex recommended it.

801
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:46,405
The advantage is,
we don't have to stay in one spot.

802
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,718
We can move about a bit and it's cheap.

Del, there is no way I am going to spend
any time in this mobile ghetto with you!

You're not going to spend any time...

and we won't be trapped, will we?

806

When we get to a campsite,
we can dump this and go walkies.

What is the condition?

811

No curries!

812
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:29,877
All right, no curries.

00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:36,284
Come on, then!
Let's go and see America! Hey, hey!

814
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:46,404
(LAUGHS)

815
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,558
Here we go, Rodders!

816
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:51,400
# Oh, the Yellow Rose of Texas

817
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:54,127
# Is the one I'm gonna see

818
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:58,565
# The Yellow Rose of Texas
is the only girl for me! #

819
00:55:58,727 --> 00:56:00,524
- DEL!
- (MAN) You jerk!

820
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:03,918
You're on the wrong side of the road!

821
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:10,202
- They drive on the right-hand side over here!
- Oh, yeah!

822
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:16,281
# Oh, the Yellow Rose of Texas
is the one I'm gonna see!

823
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:20,235
# The Yellow Rose of Texas
is the only girl for me! #

824
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,598
Yeah, what is it?

825
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,166
All right.

826
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:55,681
Hey, Tony, Lurch, Gino, smarten up!
The Don's left the courthouse.

827
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,247
- Rico.
- Yeah, Pop?

828
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:07,877
Who are those goons in the car?

829
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:14,282
- Police surveillance, nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?!

830
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:18,281
I got cops outside my front gate!
What happened to my civil rights?

831
00:58:18,847 --> 00:58:22,601
They kinda diminished
after they arrested you, Pop.

832
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:25,839
But you've been released on bail, so be happy.

833
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:30,922
Be happy (!) Be happy, huh?

834
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:34,682
One week from now, I got a jury
sitting in judgement on me!

835
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:39,967
I might spend the rest of my life in San
Quentin, and my son wants to throw a party!

836
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:46,599
What are ya, huh? What are ya?
I want to speak to my lawyer now!

837
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:48,519
Salvatore!

838
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:15,604
Salvatore...

839
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:18,938
Don Occhetti.

840
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:23,578
Salvatore...

841
00:59:23,749 --> 00:59:27,298
- Haven't I always been good to you?
- Yes, Don Occhetti.

842
00:59:27,469 --> 00:59:32,065
- Haven't I done favours for your family?
- Yes, Don Occhetti.

843
00:59:32,229 --> 00:59:35,744
- Have I ever done you harm?
- There was that time when...

844
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,218
No, Don Occhetti.

845
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:50,100
So maybe this time, Salvatore can help me,
because I'm a little confused.

846
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:54,305
This is the way I read the situation.

847
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:58,223
- You're my lawyer, correct?
- Yes, Don Occhetti.

848
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:03,782
Yet here I am looking at three
to four life sentences in the slammer,

849
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:09,262
so why the hell don't you get
off your ass and bury this rap?

850
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:14,378
- We have problems proving your innocence.
- Why?

851
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:20,465
'Cause you're guilty. When I say
"guilty", what I mean is...

852
01:00:20,629 --> 01:00:24,668
- Guilty of what?!
- Kidnapping, drug-smuggling,

853
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,344
accessory to three counts of murder.
Just gossip!

854
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:34,186
Hmm... Maybe I made
a few mistakes in the past, you know?

855
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:36,465
Nobody's perfect!

856
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:44,619
You listen to me. When my father -
God bless that man's spirit -

857
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:50,019
when he arrived on these shores
from Sicily in 1930,

858
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:53,101
this was a land of democracy and law and order.

859
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:58,627
Now, he fought to change all that,
but look at us now, huh?

860
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:03,498
What have all his efforts amounted to, huh?

861
01:01:03,669 --> 01:01:07,708
Zilch, that's what. Zilcho!

862
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,621
Salvatore, you call yourself
a lawyer? You're a schmuck!

863
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:19,147
And that goes for you, too, Rico!

864
01:01:22,109 --> 01:01:27,342
If your mother was alive -
God bless her soul - she would disown you!

865
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,261
Come on, Pop!

866
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:35,345
I tell you this, Rico, I never thought I'd see
the day when a son of mine would stand back

867
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:39,661
and watch his own father
spend the rest of his life in the state pen

868
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,980
sharing meat loaf with the faggots!

869
01:01:43,149 --> 01:01:50,146
If I go down, all the families will carve up our
empire like dogs fighting over a weenie-roast.

870
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:52,982
Every Marielito-punk from Little Havana

871
01:01:53,149 --> 01:01:56,107
will want a slice!
And what about the Colombian?

872
01:01:57,269 --> 01:02:01,228
- What Colombian?
- "What Colombian?" he says!

873
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:05,428
- What, are you a jerk, Salvatore?
- Just sit down, will ya?

874
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:18,987
Next week, Senor Vasquez arrives here
from Colombia to settle our little deal.

875
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:23,461
What do you think he's gonna do
if he thinks I've gone down the tube?

876
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:31,545
I'm getting very worried, Salvatore.
I'm getting very nervous about the future.

877
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:33,108
(BURPS)

878
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:36,181
Do you hear that? That's peptic gas.

879
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,546
That's caused by nervous exhaustion!

880
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:47,540
What happened to the ancient Sicilian traditions
of bribery, blackmail and intimidation?

881
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:55,500
This isn't the police.
This is the FBI. We can't pay those guys off.

882
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:58,058
The jury is locked in a guarded hotel,

883
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:02,302
the witnesses got 24-hour protection.
We can't reach anybody!

884
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:05,779
- Maybe I should do something, huh?
- You can't, Pop!

885
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,100
The police surveillance team is watching you.

886
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:13,308
They even got a TV camera crew
filming you for a documentary.

887
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:17,257
They're filming me?
Am I a common criminal or something?

888
01:03:19,149 --> 01:03:23,301
Rico, take some money
from the family account and buy me the DA.

889
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:28,259
You buy me the judge, you buy me
the senator. People owe me favours.

890
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,468
- I want these favours returned!
- We've tried and had no takers.

891
01:03:32,629 --> 01:03:35,860
It looks like people
are turning their backs on you.

892
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:41,467
That is a very impolite
and highly dangerous thing to do!

893
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:50,349
This is what I want you to do.

894
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:53,740
I want you to keep searching
and to keep thinking,

895
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:59,700
because somewhere, somewhere out there
lies the answer to my problems!

896
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:10,177
Look at the state of that!
You wouldn't go near that

897
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:12,658
unless you had all your own teeth!

898
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:20,258
They say that smoking's BAD for your chest (!)

899
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:23,865
(TANNOY) Miami
has been nicknamed "Cocainesville",

900
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:28,705
and the officers of Biscayne Bay
fight a year-round battle with drug runners.

901
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:35,581
On your left is the home of Barry Gibb,
lead singer of the Bee Gees.

902
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:41,062
- Rodders, look! There's a real live Bee Gee!
- 'Course it ain't!

903
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:45,541
- He's probably the gardener!
- It's him! It's Barry Gibb!

904
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:47,700
(DEL SHOUTS) All right, Bazza?

905
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:53,619
- Shut up! That's not him!
- It is!

906
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:57,987
(SHOUTS) How deep is your love,
is your love? How deep is your love?

907
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:00,946
I need all this (!)

908
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:07,028
I reckon you was right, Rodders. It weren't him.

909
01:05:07,189 --> 01:05:11,182
- Most probably the gardener.
- Yeah? What did I say?

910
01:05:22,749 --> 01:05:25,343
(DISCO MUSIC)

911
01:05:36,669 --> 01:05:39,183
Come on, Rodney, bellies in!

912
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:44,582
I still think it would be better to drive
to the camper site now and book in first.

913
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:49,823
It's only quarter to eight. There's plenty of time
to get to the old campsite!

914
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:54,141
There's also plenty of time
for you to get drunk after we've booked in!

915
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:59,827
Get drunk? You enjoy
putting me down, don't you?

916
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:04,426
You think I'm just a one-dimensional
person. Well, you're wrong!

917
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:08,343
The only reason I want to go
into that club is to phone Raquel,

918
01:06:08,509 --> 01:06:12,502
because I promised her
I would as soon as we arrived.

919
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:16,139
What's wrong with the public
call box over there?

920
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:18,823
You can't get a drink in there!

921
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:24,342
- Come on!
- What shall we do with our luggage?

922
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:28,502
Let's bring it with us and put it
in the middle of the dance floor

923
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:32,139
and boogie round it
like them sorts at the Nag's Head

924
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:35,062
when they have a disco with their handbags!

925
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:37,220
No need to be sarky!

926
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:40,620
What are you talking about, disco and boogie?

927
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,780
Del, I am not boogie-ing!

928
01:06:42,949 --> 01:06:46,624
Keep your voice down!
We are ambassadors for our country!

929
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:51,101
We don't want people thinking
we're lager louts! Excuse me. Mais oui!

Hey, Juan! Over here, Juan!
When you're ready, son.

932
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:21,142
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm sorry,
but this club is for members only.

Sorry, signore, I did not realise it was you!

Please accept my deepest
and sincerest apologies!

936
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:36,989
I am honoured that you should choose
to visit my humble nightclub.

937
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:39,902
Please may I offer you a drink?

938
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:42,060
Yeah, we'll have a Cuba Libre

939
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:45,266
- and something non-alcoholic.
- Of course.

940
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:50,503
- We'll be sitting over there.
- I will be with you immediately.

941
01:07:56,509 --> 01:08:00,548
(RICO) There's gonna be a war!
(SALVATORE) Maybe not.

942
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:05,305
The only thing that can prevent it
is if you find an alibi for my father.

943
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:08,302
I have to find your father nine alibis!

944
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:11,267
How the hell am I supposed
to do that in a week?

945
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:15,581
How can the Justice Department
do this? Don't they know who he is?

946
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:20,220
- Yeah, that's the problem!
- When the jury foreman says "Guilty",

947
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:22,027
the war begins.

948

Maybe not.

949
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:29,426
Do you think the rest of the families are gonna
pretend the old man is still in power?

950
01:08:29,589 --> 01:08:33,138
- They're gonna go to war! Am I right?
- You're right.

- Tony?
- Right.

- Am I right?
- Maybe not.

- Signore Ricardo...
- Can't you see I'm in a meeting?

956
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:48,105
I would like to explain.

957
01:08:48,269 --> 01:08:53,468
If I had know HE was coming tonight,
I would have arranged a private room.

958
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,938
If you'd known who was coming here?

959
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:58,020
Your father.

01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:03,064
- My father.
- (PAULY) Is this some kind of joke?

961
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:07,586
Don Occhetti can't even get
to the john without the police tailing him.

962
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:11,025
But he is here! See for yourself!

963
01:09:23,109 --> 01:09:25,862
Lovely jubbly! How much do we owe you?

- Would you like to eat?
- No, thanks. We had something earlier.

as always, I am at your service!

- What?
- American hospitality! They're famous for it!

Come on! Come on! Yo, Gino, it's Tony.

974
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:07,898
Is the Don there? He's in the pool.

975
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,220
Can you actually see him?

976
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,065
Good! Dad's at home.

977
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:18,618
The guy over there ain't him!

978
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:26,667
Listen carefully. Tell my father
to stay in his room till I get back tonight.

979
01:10:26,829 --> 01:10:31,345
Just... tell him I may have a surprise for him.

980
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,264
Tell you what...

981
01:10:44,429 --> 01:10:48,661
- I'm boilin'!
- That's strange, that.

982
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:54,028
Here you are in a tropical climate,
wearing a worsted polyester blue serge suit,

983
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:56,180
- and you feel hot?
- Yeah.

984
01:10:56,349 --> 01:10:59,546
Weird!

985
01:10:59,709 --> 01:11:01,540
Hi!

986
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:03,427
How you guys doing?

987
01:11:04,589 --> 01:11:09,105
All right. Yeah - great time.
Smashing, thank you.

988
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:13,057
Good. Let me guess. You're not local people.

989
01:11:13,229 --> 01:11:15,823
(RODNEY) No.

990
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:38,425
(LAUGHTER)

991
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,227
(INDISTINCT)

992
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:46,461
Come on, one more. One more.

993
01:11:46,629 --> 01:11:49,621
No, really. We're pushing our luck as it is.

994
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:51,268
No, he's right, Rico.

995
01:11:51,429 --> 01:11:53,863
- Come on!
- You've got time for one more.

996
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:57,499
- Go on, then, one for the road.
- No, Del. Come on, mate.

997
01:11:57,669 --> 01:12:01,378
The campsite will be shut
and we'll be locked out.

998
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:05,827
I didn't realise it was so late.
We've got to be going.

999
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,823
Well, Rodney... Del Boy!

1000
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:12,025
Rico!

1001
01:12:12,189 --> 01:12:16,068
Thanks very much! It's been
really great meeting you guys!

1002
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:20,825
Thanks a lot, and we enjoyed
your company and everything.

1003
01:12:20,989 --> 01:12:25,505
We've got to go.
See you later, yeah? Thanks a lot.
