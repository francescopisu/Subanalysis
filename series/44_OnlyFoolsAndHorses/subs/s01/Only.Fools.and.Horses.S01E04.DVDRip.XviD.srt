1
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,016
Here we are, the finest French
lace hankies - there you are,

2
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,678
they're a pleasure to have the
flu with! Thank's luv.

3
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,790
Now hurry up girls, get in
while the going's good.

4
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,195
It's one for the price of two.
One for the price of two.

5
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:48,843
Keep taking their money, I'm going to pop down the pub
to get a lemonade for the old Hobsons.

6
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,627
Get us a packet of pork
scratchings would you.

7
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:54,339
Pork scratchings. Sounds like
a pig with fleas.

8
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:57,627
Come on then, get in while the
going's good.

9
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:01,627
We're not here today gone tomorrow, we're
here today gone this afternoon, now come on.

10
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:08,968
- Hey, hey, alright Trigger?
- Hello Del Boy, how's yer luck?

11
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:10,492
You can have it for a nicker.

12
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:15,787
Hello Joyce, I'll have a pint of diesel oil for Trigger
and I'll have a blackcurrant and Pernod.

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,988
- You'll never guess ho I just saw!
- Er, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.

14
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,290
No. No, yer miles off Del!

15
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,782
No, no, I knew he wouldn't be in here.
He'd be in the saloon bar wouldn't he.

16
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,761
- I'm joking, Trigger.
- Oh gotcha! No, it was your ex-fiancee!

17
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,777
- Which one?
- Pauline

18
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:46,108
Pauline? Pauline Harris? No,
no, no you must have been mistaken.

19
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:49,286
She got married to that Bobby Finch didn't she
and went to live abroad.

20
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:52,946
- Yeah? Well who's that sitting over there then?
- Hm. Where?

21
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,806
Cor, it is her Trigger. It is her.

22
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:06,969
It's at moments like this when I wish I carried an
emergency capsule of Brut around with me!

23
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,860
Leave it out will you Del, you
don't wanna get yourself involved with her again.

24
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,130
- Remember what happened last time?
- Yeah, yeah. Did she ask about me?

25
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,524
Yeah, she seemed very
concerned to know how much you was earning.

26
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,349
- How the hell do you do that?
- What?

27
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:27,818
I said she seemed very
concerned to know how much you was earning.

28
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:32,321
Yeah well she probably is concerned.
You know, perhaps she's worrying about me!

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,791
Alright, alright,
I'm not gonna get involved am I?

30
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:42,429
No, I'm too shrewd for all that, ain't I? No, I
might just go over there and say hello.

31
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:45,194
If that
is alright with you two?

32
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,594
You want your brains testing!

33
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,839
Yeah thank you, Joyce. There
did you take one for yourself?

34
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,467
- No.
- Good!

35
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,114
Excuse me. Excuse me, squire.

36
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:21,422
- Hello Pauline!
- Del...

37
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:31,049
Oh I can't believe it...It's
so nice to see you again.

38
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:36,371
Well it's nice to see you. Pauline, what have you got
over your lips there? What's all that?

39
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,374
- It's blackcurrant.
- You what?

40
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:40,528
It's on your lips.

41
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:43,906
Oh blackcurrant, look - yeah,
it's probably from my blackcurrant and Pernod.

42
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:52,887
Sorry. Oh thanks. Ta. Here
let me, er, let me wipe that off yer -

43
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,998
I haven't seen you for 12 years or more,
I want to know all that's been happening!

44
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:09,524
Nothing you know, nothing really! I heard you got
married to that Bobby Finch...where's he now?

45
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,835
- He's down the Blackshaw Road.
- Oh yeah what in those council flats?

46
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,488
No in a cemetery. You mean you
didn't know?

47
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,829
No! No, no, I'm terribly sorry,
I am sorry, I didn't realise.

48
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,453
You see the last I heard was
that, you know, that you went to live abroad,

49
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,971
so naturally I thought that you and Bobby,
like, had emigrated.

50
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:32,792
No, after Bobby died I went to San Francisco -
it suited me being away from familiar surroundings.

51
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,921
I got a job as an air hostess, it's a good salary,
uniform, free travel!

52
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:41,445
Yeah of course! That's in your blood innit eh?
'Cos your mum was a bus conductress.

53
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:50,029
- You never married yourself, Del?
- No, no, no, I never fancied myself.

54
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,827
No, no, no, you know what I
mean, I mean what I mean is you know,

55
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:04,252
I never - never met a girl that I cared all that much
about really you know.

56
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,529
Well, I mean, you know, well,
there was one.

57
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:12,805
- But you don't see her?
- Oh yeah. Well I'm looking at her now.

58
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,786
Where's my pork scratchings?

59
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:27,142
Oh I'm sorry Rodney, I got
distracted. Yeah. This is my brother Rodney.

60
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,414
D'you remember - you remember Rodney.
He used to be a little scruff.

61
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:36,721
Look at him now, he's a big scruff,
isn't he? You remember Pauline?

62
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:39,607
Yeah I remember. Pauline Harris
innit?

63
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,281
Yeah, yeah or do you call yourself Mrs. Finch now?

64
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,153
No. I call myself Mrs. Baker.
I remarried, you see, an American chap.

65
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,070
Oh gotcha, you're a divorcee
are you?

66
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,676
No, a widow!

67
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:57,356
Blimey, what he kicked the bucket and all did he? No, I
am sorry, I didn't mean that, sorry.

68
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:02,238
What about that - ain't that a shame, eh, Rodney
you know she's had two husbands die on her.

69
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,671
Yeah, one more she keeps the
match ball.

70
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,357
- Excuse me a moment.
- Yeah, yeah of course.

71
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,149
I'm just going to powder my
nose.

72
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:15,885
Yeah, yeah, well hurry back
won't you because, you know I'll be waiting.

73
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:23,837
Yes of course Pauline, hurry back Pauline, can I
pull the chain for you Pauline? You make me sick!

74
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,442
You've been very hostile
towards Pauline ain't you?

75
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,858
Well, can you blame me? I remember how she treated you
when you was engaged.

76
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:34,493
I may only have been a little nipper
Del, but I remember how she screwed you up.

77
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:39,840
That was a long time go Rodney, weren't it?
Pauline and me, when engaged, we was mod

78
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,020
the only reason she left we was
because she found a bloke with a faster Vespa.

79
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,896
And that's a fair reason?

80
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:49,653
Yeah it was in them days.
You've got to understand the times Rodney.

81
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,511
In them days, I mean, teenage marriages broke
up because the husband didn't like the Hollies!

82
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:03,762
But we're older now, you know, more
mature, we've developed sensitivity and emotion.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,293
Oh my God.

84
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:09,730
Yeah we have - what would you know about it anyway, eh?
You don't have romantic feelings you,

85
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:16,689
you just have animal urges. Sometimes I think you
learnt the art of seduction by watching Wildlife on One!

86
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:29,727
You've got to understand Rodney that - you know deep
down inside me I'm a very sensitive person. I am, I am.

87
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:35,319
What - look at last Christmas and that film Love Story.
Look how upset I got then.

88
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:36,815
I got upset an' all.

89
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:42,196
I know, I know, I got upset because Ali MacGraw died -
you got upset because Ryan O'Neal didn't.

90
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:46,870
Well, he's too good-looking
ain't he?

91
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:52,338
What do you know about it anyway? What do you know?
I am talking about men and women I am.

92
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,419
You, you're still knocking
about with Brownies.

93
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,781
No I'm not.

94
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:59,873
Yes you are, leave it out,
some of your dates arrived by skateboard.

95
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:05,233
Look Del, all I'm trying to
say is don't get hiked up with that Pauline again.

96
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,806
She'll screw you up, you mark my words.

97
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:18,821
Look, Rodney, a lot of water has run under the bridge since
me and Pauline broke up. I know what it's all about now,

98
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:30,861
I understand the rules of the game. I know you're
concerned for me and trying to give me your advice but...

99
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:38,084
how can I put it? Shove it Rodney,
shove it.

100
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:52,495
Del Boy's late ain't he Rodney?

101
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:57,834
I wouldn't worry about it Grandad. I'll give him another
15 minutes then start phoning round the morgues.

102
00:08:58,061 --> 00:08:59,297
What do you mean the morgues?

103
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:03,554
Well, it's something about that Pauline that kills 'em
off. I think she must be a carrier or something.

104
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:10,454
It's bad news him meeting her again this afternoon. I
remember the last time she hooked him.

105
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:15,731
I mean, up till then he was doing alright -
well your mum had died

106
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,871
and your dad had run off and left you
but...

107
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,017
But other than that tickety-
boo?

108
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:26,643
Right, Del was out wheeling and dealing and he
was coming along nice. Then she turned up.

109
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:33,398
I've never seen anyone change so fast as Del Boy.
He was besotted with her

110
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:42,430
they was engaged within the week, broken up within the month.
Little cow was out skylarking around with other fellas.

111
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:52,142
Del had more fights that John Wayne. Well, up 'till then he
was always a strong believer in God and all that.

112
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:56,285
I mean he didn't go to church or nothing.

113
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,676
No, didn't carry it to
ridiculous lengths?

114
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:04,538
No. But he'd always give the church a good few quid
towards their fund for a new roof.

115
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:09,808
He said it was a penance seeing
as how it was him that nicked the old one.

116
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:14,588
But after that he
lost faith.

117
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:19,607
Act naturally - stare vaguely at them tellies right
and no questions.

118
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,429
God Almighty, what's he done?

119
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:49,704
Gentlemen, attention gentleman. Gentlemen and Grandad
I have a announcement to make.

120
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,590
Pauline and I are engaged to be married.

121
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,657
Don't all bust a blood vessel
will you, eh?

122
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:03,375
That's triffic Del. We'll have to put an announcement in the
Exchange and Mart.

123
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:10,567
That's a lovely idea that, here go and get some glasses,
go on and get some glasses, we'll celebrate alright.

124
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,871
Celebrate? You think I'm gonna celebrate my older brother
getting hiked up to a gold digger?

125
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:21,319
Listen, oi, listen motor-mouth!
I know that you don't like Pauline...

126
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,135
Oh does it notice that much?

127
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:31,269
Yes it does. I know - look I know you don't like the idea,
right, but it's, you know - that's what I want!

128
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,371
Right come on, come on, have a drink eh?

129
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,449
Yeah...Yeah I'll get some glasses.

130
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,634
Yeah, get some glasses - get some glasses, that's it. Here,
Grandad, what do you think then Grandad?

131
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:51,524
I'm not saying a word Del Boy! You want to put yourself in
lumber for the rest of your life that's entirely up to you.

132
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,305
I'm not saying nothing!

133
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:58,810
Oi, listen, you haven't heard the best part yet,
listen this is double celebration,

134
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:07,084
because not only have I got engaged to Pauline,
but my bride to be has kindly condescended

135
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,319
to come and live with us!

136
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,412
Well don't say your
congratulations then will yer!

137
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,929
Alright.

138
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,306
Say something Grandad.

139
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:32,122
There's a film on the other side, lots of people getting
killed in it!

140
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,495
I cleaned that table today!

141
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,382
Good, it won't make my plim-
soles dirty, will it?

142
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,472
What?

143
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:07,614
Rodney! Well, that was divine my love. That was divine.
That was well - was - Pas de Calais

144
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,773
as they say in France. Long
time since we has a steak like that, eh, Rodney?

145
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,394
Hell of a long time Del. Me
and Grandad had corned beef!

146
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,602
Corned beef?

147
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,566
I'm not cooking for them two as well Derek!
I'll cook for you and me and you and me only.

148
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,688
I didn't come here to be a skivvy!

149
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:28,204
No, no, no, I know my love. I know my petal,
you see the thing is

150
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,244
when I gave you the housekeeping money at the
beginning of the week,

151
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,542
I meant for you to get some grub for
them an' all.

152
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:34,915
I did, I got corned beef!

153
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:40,821
Ah yeah - well. There you are see, you like a little bit of
corned beef don't you Grandad?

154
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:45,893
What's up with you then, eh?

155
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,069
- It's her innit!
- What?

156
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:50,546
She hid my teeth!

157
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:58,393
What - what you hidden his
teeth for then petal?

158
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:03,582
Look you don't know what it's like in this place. Well you
and Rodney are out at the auctions or the market.

159
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:11,585
But I'm stuck here with him. He's nibbling all day long.
There'd be nothing left if I let him carry on!

160
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:14,517
Don't worry,
he gets his teeth back at meal times.

161
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,768
Yeah, alright, well you - you
know best, eh petal.

162
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:29,960
Why don't you and Grandad go
out Rodney? I wouldn't mind being alone for once!

163
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:32,493
- D'you want to be left alone?
- Of course.

164
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:36,788
- Right, I'll go with 'em, come on Grandad.
- I mean alone with you.

165
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:37,865
Oh, I see.

166
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,271
Well we never have any time
for ourselves in this place.

167
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:47,100
No time to yourselves! You spend most of your lives in
that bedroom! Giant pandas mate quicker than you two!

168
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,476
Please. That's enough!

169
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:55,328
Ever since I moved in here all we ever seem to do of an
evening is sitting here watching them rotten televisions.

170
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:59,604
And that's another thing, why does he
have to watch two televisions?

171
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:02,009
'Cos the other one's being
mended!

172
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,176
You mean he normally watches
three?

173
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,748
- Yeah!
- He's going senile.

174
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:12,747
Well wouldn't he be happier
with company of his own age?

175
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,645
You're not bringing your
Granny round here to live with us are you?

176
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,890
- I was thinking of a home.
- He's already got a home!

177
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:24,017
I know a very nice place down near Thames Ditton.
Bobby Finch's Grandad died there.

178
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:29,760
I can't put him in a home
Pauline, he's family!

179
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,214
- But I'll be your family soon!
- Well you go to a home then...

180
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,316
I don't want to go into a home
Rodney, I might catch something!

181
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:40,030
Don't you worry Grandad, we're
staying put.

182
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,835
Well, the only alternative is
for us to buy a house of our own!

183
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:48,196
What, me buy a house? No, no, couldn't do that.
Couldn't do that. Don't you see that

184
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:52,054
as soon as I put my signature on a document
the authorities are gonna know that I'm alive.

185
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:57,031
They'll be round here after
their pound of flesh quicker than the Mafia!

186
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:01,589
But you can do what my other husbands did,
put the house in my name.

187
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:06,569
Well nobody's going to think it strange me buying
a house, not with all the money I got on the life insurance.

188
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,448
Have you got your life insured Del?

189
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,336
No. I've never thought about
dying before!

190
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:17,773
Well, we'll have to sort that
out - a wife needs protection.

191
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,949
Specially with your luck
Pauline!

192
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,620
- I fancy an early night Del.
- Oh no, what, again?

193
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,047
- Come on.
- Yes alright my love, my petal...

194
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,072
Listen you two - hey!

195
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:45,467
You ready Grandad?

196
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:49,096
Yeah - I just wanna see what
happens first!

197
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,522
Eh? Now don't start making excuses!
We both agreed we're not wanted here no more,

198
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,566
so let's get out before Del wakes up.

199
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:58,527
We can't go without saying
goodbye to him!

200
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,852
No, alright we'll say goodbye
then we'll get on our way.

201
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,303
Is Del up yet?

202
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,422
No he's still in bed. He needs
his sleep, he had a bad night.

203
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:11,780
Yeah, didn't sound too bad
from where I was... I'll go and wake him up.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,455
I'll wake him Rodney! I don't
want you going in that room.

205
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:18,242
That's my Mum's room!

206
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,269
It used to be your Mum's room Rodney but it's mine now
and I don't want to see you in there. Is that understood?

207
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,418
Jawohl mein Oppengruppenfuhrer!

208
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,451
Act your age Rodney...

209
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:34,985
Why don't you bike it you old bag! You know why she don't
want us in there don't you?

210
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:41,810
Probably filled up with sexual torture devices. I bet poor
Del's in there now, bound and gagged, wearing a rubber mask,

211
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,241
a loincloth and being
threatened with French lessons.

212
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,574
Maybe that's why he's been
looking a bit seedy lately!

213
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,013
Yeah and it's hardly through lack of food is it. I mean,
look, there are Third World nations

214
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:59,350
who'd give up their mineral rights for what's on
that plate. I wonder what happened to his fried slice.

215
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:03,509
Perhaps he didn't want it. His stomach's been
a bit dicky hasn't it.

216
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:04,919
That's true...

217
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:15,690
Hello Trigger...Yeah, hang on I'll get him,
Pauline, untie Del will you he's wanted!

218
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:21,643
I'm up, I'm up...What do you
mean untie Del anyway?

219
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,639
- Nothing.
- Who is it?

220
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:24,952
It's Trigger.

221
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:28,386
Trigger? Oh, hello Trigger, what do you want?
No, no, no, you didn't disturb me,

222
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,935
I had to get up anyway, I was
wanted on the phone!

223
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:34,161
Hang on a minute will you Trigger?
Cut it out

224
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:37,822
I'm just popping down to the
jewelers to put a deposit on that ring I saw.

225
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:43,631
Another one? You've been engaged five times, married
twice, you must have more rings than Bravingtons.

226
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,401
Just shut it Rodney!

227
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:48,422
I mean what is it with you, eh? Are you trying
to corner the world's gold market

228
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,599
or have you just got a thing about wedding cakes?

229
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,053
I'll bang you one in a minute,
leave her alone will you!

230
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,899
Don't forget you've got to arrange a medical for your life
insurance. I'll see you down the estate agents.

231
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,984
We can go on to the bank from there.

232
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:04,839
- Alright darling, yeah.
- Sieg Heil!

233
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:10,245
Cut it out, what have you been doing sniffing that glue again
have you? Cor dear -

234
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,156
Hello, sorry about that Trigger, yeah, no just Rodney
having one of his fits...

235
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:24,792
Anyway what d'you want to phone me about? What do you
mean it's a delicate matter? No, I know you're a mate!

236
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:30,606
No, I won't say that you're interfering! I promise I won't
tell you to mind your own business.

237
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:41,839
Just say hat you want to say will you...Yeah...
Oh did I? Did you? Did he?

238
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:48,925
Well listen Trig, why don't you mind your own bloody
business, eh? Who do you think you are interfering?

239
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:52,180
Look, you just keep your nose out of it,
alright pal?

240
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,343
How's Trigger keeping?

241
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:01,805
D'you know what he had the audacity to say,
he phoned me up to say he heard last night

242
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:08,011
that the police had investigated Bobby Finch's
death. Apparently he died of ...food poisoning!

243
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,618
Food poisoning! Oh...

244
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:15,089
Your breakfast's getting cold
Del Boy!

245
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:27,099
Yeah, yeah, thanks Grandad. Do you know I think I'm putting
on a bit of weight. I think I'll - I think I'll go on a diet.

246
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:30,028
Get off, there's no calories
in weed-killer!

247
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:41,108
You make me die you do! I suppose you think that Pauline's gone -
gone window shopping at Rentokill.

248
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,907
Well I'm going down to make
arrangements for my medical, I'll see you two later.

249
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:49,905
No you won't Del. Because me and Grandad have had it
up to here. We're getting out!

250
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:56,696
Eh? What d'you mean you're leaving? No - leave it out
Rodney, what you do for money?

251
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:59,254
We'll get by. We're thinking
about forming a partnership!

252
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:04,683
A partnership! A partnership, you and Grandad?
Gawd leave it out Rodney,

253
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:09,923
What have you been doing, sitting on your brains again?
You must have noticed at one time or another

254
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:13,900
that he doesn't move. You know - he made the front page
of the Lancet...

255
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:17,676
...don't you as being the only living man in history to
be treated for rigor mortis...

256
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,157
Where you going to go anyway?

257
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:25,149
- Auntie Rose's in Clacton.
- Auntie Rose's in Clacton?

258
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,603
Yeah. Grandad says we can go
there anytime.

259
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:33,467
Oh did he! Oh did he. Well you'd better go there now then
hadn't you, eh? Go on. The pair of you, get on your bike.

260
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:37,493
Go on before Pauline comes back with -
with me Deadly Nightshade.

261
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:49,701
Rodney - no - come on you don't believe all that rubbish
about food poisoning do you?

262
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:53,974
Of course not, eat your mushrooms Del.

263
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,470
We're not coming back Del.

264
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,628
No, hang about, I'm coming with you.

265
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:14,946
Come on Rodney, you bring them suitcases.
Grandpa, you carry the light stuff. Okay!

266
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:24,138
Surprise, surprise, hello Auntie, I bet you're surprised
to see us, eh love? Come on, come on. Bring that in you two.

267
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:37,666
Oh yes, very nice. Here we are. Here, Grandad, change the
channels over will you, there's racing on half past two.

268
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,668
So what d'you put in the note
to Pauline then?

269
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:51,047
I just put 'My dearest darling Pauline. The engagement's off,
the wedding's off and, as you can gather from this letter,

270
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:59,018
I'm off! I'll give you five days to clear out of the flat
and do not ever come back...you money-grabbing old murderess.

271
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,429
All my love Del Boy!' And then lots of kisses. I didn't -
I didn't put it quite as nicely as that

272
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,397
but that was the gist
of the idea, yeah.

273
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,799
God knows what we'll go back to! She'll most probably
smash that flat to pieces!

274
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,636
Have you had enough?

275
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,185
That was handsome - handsome well it was,
Champs Elysees as the French say.

276
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,084
Now listen Auntie, we're going to be here for about five days
so what I want you to do is,

277
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,248
I want you to take this money here like that,
put that in yer pinny,

278
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,986
because I don't want you spending your own
money on us. Alright?

279
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:34,380
Well that's very nice of you!
Do you mind if I ask you something?

280
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:38,594
Well of course not, maniere
d' etre. Fire away.

281
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,656
Who are you?

282
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:47,715
Who - who are we?

283
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,762
You mean we've been in your house for five hours, had all
your shepherd's pie and had a bath each

284
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,690
and you don't know
who we are?

285
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:58,885
Well I didn't like to ask you
because you seemed to know me!

286
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:05,535
We're Joannie's boys aren't we.
Well, I mean, he isn't no - no.

287
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:10,955
You remember Joannie, my mum,
married Reg Trotter! You were at the wedding!

288
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,917
I don't remember you!

289
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,205
No, no, no, of course you wouldn't remember me, not at
me mum's wedding. I was only a babe in arms.

290
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:23,328
- You said come down anytime!
- When was this then?

291
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:28,087
- 1947!
- So here we are!

292
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:38,812
You must - you must remember the wedding! It was at that
big church - you know Our Lady the Divine Rosemary, Peckham

293
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:45,304
Peckham...I've never been to Peckham in my life!
Funny you should mention it though because

294
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,246
the lady that owned this cottage before me,
she came from Peckham.

295
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,844
Auntie Rose has moved!

296
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:54,825
- Well who's this then?
- Gawd knows!

297
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,802
Joannie! Joannie Hollins?
Married a Jamaican fella?

298
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:06,296
- Yeah.
- Yeah but you don't look very...

299
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,817
- We're adopted!
- Oh, would you like some apple pie?

300
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:15,268
That would be smashing Auntie, thank you.

301
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:31,008
Sssh, come in. Come on, come in here. Listen, be alert!
Pauline could come rushing out of any of these rooms

302
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:38,046
in there brandishing her mother-of-pearl hankies flick knives!
It'll be like Psycho in a tower block.

303
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:44,623
Sssh, listen, I'll take the living room, Rodney you take
the bedroom, Grandad you take the kitchen...

304
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:47,914
Right and good luck!

305
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:53,681
- Go on my son, go on, go on.

306
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:09,915
- She's not in the bedrooms!

307
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,267
She done any damage?

308
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,953
No, all the beds are neatly made,
she's even been round with the hoover!

309
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:17,501
She's not in the kitchen! It
ain't 'arf clean and tidy out there!

310
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,173
What's her game then, eh? What is her game? There's no-way
that Pauline would leave this flat

311
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,549
without doing something really nasty to me!

312
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,475
No, no, don't be daft.
Where would she get a bomb from, eh?

313
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:38,734
Eh there's a letter here! It's addressed to 'That no-good
lying two-faced creepo'.

314
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,810
Oh, that'll be for me Rodney!

315
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:48,245
Let's have a look, see what
she's got to say for herself then, eh? Right, here we are.

316
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:56,815
Oh well now that's more like the Pauline that I know and
loved! Oh dear look at the language here.

317
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:01,261
You'd think an ex-air hostess would know how to
spell better than that look at that, eh?

318
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:06,326
- Is that true?
- No, get off!

319
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:09,529
Del - did Pauline really mean
that much to you?

320
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:25,022
No, no, not really. No, somehow it wasn't quite the same.
Sometimes I think I'm not really cut out for this falling in love lark.

321
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:38,282
I've got a confession to make Del. You know that phone call
from Trigger, the one about the police investigations

322
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:44,589
into food poisoning, well it was a wind-up!
Me and Grandad put him up to it...We did it for you Del.

323
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,950
You put him up to it?

324
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:55,556
It was nothing to do with me
Del, I only suggested it.

325
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,942
Yeah, he only suggested it! We
was only thinking of you Del.

326
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:06,748
You was only thinking of me!
You couple of...rascals

327
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,346
What am I going to do with you
two, eh? What am I going to do with you?

328
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,825
Got you out of schtuk didn't it!

329
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:18,360
Yeah, we're alright on our own
- we don't need no birds.

330
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:24,018
No, no, not if you say so Grandad...Here - go on - go on,
put the kettle on, eh?

331
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,171
Look at the girl the way she spells.

332
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:31,628
That's, that's PTO 'please turn over'.

333
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:39,533
I know that, I know that please turn over means, don't
I, PTO, I'm not illiterate an' all that.

334
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,198
Here, there's someone on the
phone, it's Tim!

335
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:44,675
- Tim who?
- Tim, the talking clock.

336
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,475
Here. Oh the cow! She only phoned the talking clock
before she left!

337
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,682
And this is - Gordon Bennett this is dated
four days ago!

338
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:00,888
I don't want to worry you Del but this
Tim's got a funny accent!

339
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,949
She only phoned the talking
clock in America that's all.

340
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:15,420
You mean we're connected to
America? It's amazing innit! Hallo.

341
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,665
Hang it up!

342
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:24,755
