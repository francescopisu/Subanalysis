1
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:44,664
Listen, now listen. 'Ere, why shed a tear over the recession
when you've got me around, eh?

2
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:49,936
Now just look what I've brought you today girls. Look
at that, authentic French tights, alright?

3
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:56,059
As worn by Sacha Distel's mum! No seriously - I'm being serious.
Now they're 20 denier and they're sheer nylon,

4
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:00,825
not only are they run proof but they're fun proof as well.
Now listen, if I asked you for a pound a pair

5
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,880
I'd get killed in the stampede wouldn't I?
Yes, I would, I know,

6
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:08,814
I can see your face but I'll tell you what I'm not asking you
for a pound a pair, I'm not asking you for 80p a pair.

7
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:12,493
What did you say? You'd give me 60p a
pair would you love? Put your money away

8
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:18,025
I don't want 60p - I don't want 60p a pair.
I want 50p a pair and I'm starving myself...

9
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,493
Now come on. Ladies, 'ere I thought you,
I thought you were bargain hunters. You ladies.

10
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,620
Now look you can't even get these in the factory
for 50p a pair.

11
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:34,963
Oi Rodney, am I keeping you awake?

12
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:37,493
No don't you mind me Del, you
carry on.

13
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:43,486
Listen I know the Government keeps asking us to save energy,
but this is taking the piss!

14
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:49,447
Look, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, worrying
about all the trouble and what 'ave yer!

15
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:51,273
Trouble. What trouble?

16
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,691
Well last night I went round that bird Linda's
house for the evening, right.

17
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,728
And her mum and dad come home earlier
than what we expected.

18
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,855
Catch you at it, did they?

19
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:05,117
Well no - you know they didn't actually catch us.
It was all a bit of a panic though.

20
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:07,140
So where does all the trouble
come from then?

21
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:12,262
Well as I was leaving, her dad just happened to notice
I had me jeans on back to front.

22
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:18,631
You had yer jeans on back
to...Well what'd he say?

23
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,636
He swore at me!

24
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:26,086
Yeah I bet he did...I bet he didn't know whether
you were coming or going!

25
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:34,080
Oh, hello Trigger. 'Ere, how's
yer gran?

26
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:36,461
Didn't you hear Del? The old
girl passed on.

27
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,449
Oh what a shame, I am sorry
Trigger.

28
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:44,420
Weren't your fault Del.
The funeral's on Friday. You'll come won't you?

29
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:50,803
Er, Friday's a bit difficult. I'm a bit tied up actually
Trigger. Anyway you don't want a big crowd there do yer!

30
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,683
There won't be a big crowd
Del, I'm the only one who's going.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,905
Oh yeah, yeah, I'll come. I tell you what
I'll bring Grandad and all.

32
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:04,960
'Cos he used to know your gran, didn't he?
Rodney'll come as well.

33
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,402
- Cheers Del - appreciate it.
- That's alright.

34
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:15,471
- I'll tell you what, I'll order a car shall I?
- That's a good idea, Trigger.

35
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,063
I'll see you at gran's house,
'bout ten o' clock.

36
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,677
Alright - cheers.

37
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:23,306
Oi you, what's the idea of
lumbering me with a funeral?

38
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:27,555
He's a mate, isn't he?
You wouldn't want him to go on his own would you?

39
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:32,340
No of course you wouldn't. Anyway going to a funeral'll be
good practice for me and Grandad.

40
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,245
Practice for what?

41
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,348
For when that Linda's dad
catches up with you.

42
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,003
Now that is not funny Derek!

43
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:44,576
Yeah I think it is - hilarious. Alright, come on then girls,
'ere we are, genuine French tights,

44
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:47,033
as worn by Charles Aznavour's sister.

45
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,973
It's Wedgewood.

46
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,283
Wedgewood's pottery!

47
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,758
Oh, is it? Oh yeah. I always got those two mixed up.

48
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:14,251
That must have been why I couldn't sell that
Chippendale teapot last week! Oh well.

49
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:17,046
Here - look at this over here.
Look at that.

50
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:23,459
It's a copy.

51
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,344
No, these are nice. Look at that - these are a nice,
matching pair an' all.

52
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,173
Talk about a vulture.

53
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:36,925
No listen, Grandad. Look, Trigger's gran left him these
in 'er will, and all this other stuff he wants to sell it, right.

54
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:41,667
You know Trigger, he's not the brightest thing
in Christendom, is he eh? I mean,

55
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,539
I know a lot of people are born a penny
short of a shilling but in Trigger's case God added VAT.

56
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,043
Look, if he tries to take this lot up town he's
going to get right taken in ain't he - eh?

57
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:56,112
So I reckon it's much better that he gets - well, you know,
stitched up by a friend rather than a stranger.

58
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,824
I've put your coats in the
bedroom. Fancy a drink?

59
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,668
- No.
- Dave?

60
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,890
Just a small large one, Trigger.

61
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:11,207
Oi, don't you think this is the wrong time and place
to be shanting it up?

62
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:15,571
No, no, of course not. Eh, Trigger what you reckon, eh?
Would your gran like to think of us, you know,

63
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:17,438
standing round moping and mourning?

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,059
Yeah, she'd have loved it. She
was a miserable old cow!

65
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:29,954
She never used to be like that son. When she was younger she
was a real live wire. Life and soul of the party was Alice.

66
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:34,262
Yeah, I heard she was a bit of a girl. They reckon that's
what helped finish my grandad off.

67
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,003
You knew my grandad Arthur
didn't you, Mr Trotter?

68
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,982
Yeah, I knew Arthur alright.

69
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:43,477
He was a smashing man. He took
care of me when my mum went.

70
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:44,876
Where was your dad?

71
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,550
He died a couple of years
before I was born.

72
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:59,308
I can almost see my grandad now, sitting by the fire, one
leg on the fender - other one in the corner.

73
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,367
It's alright, he had a false
leg didn't he - it came off...

74
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,695
- ...Had a leg that long.
- Don't you be silly.

75
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,781
He was a road sweeper as well.

76
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,576
Yeah taught you the trade
didn't he Trigger - eh?

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,975
Takes you back, dunnit?

78
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,824
Come on Trigger, it's no point dwelling in the past, you've
gotta look towards the future ain't yer?

79
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,728
Come on, you're
going on your holidays on Tuesday ain't you?

80
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:23,023
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that Del.
I've been under a bit of pressure lately,

81
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:28,082
what with Gran in hospital and me case being adjourned.
It'll be nice to get away from it all.

82
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:34,853
I'm gonna live it up a bit.
Discos, nightclubs, golden beaches, blue skies.

83
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,907
Sounds great Trigger. Where
you going?

84
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:44,581
Ireland...Me gran left me a bit of money and these bits
and pieces, so I ain't short of a few bob.

85
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,368
The car's here.

86
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:54,865
Well, just take one last look round the old place.
When you think of all that's gone on in this house.

87
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,480
Me gran and grandad living here together.
Makes you go cold don't it?

88
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:04,970
No, no, come on Trigger
- should be the opposite, shouldn't it -

89
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,551
I mean you must remember all the
warmth and the love that they had between them!

90
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,116
No, there weren't much of that Del Boy, they didn’t talk to
each other for 15 years.

91
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,274
15 years??

92
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,365
Yeah, me grandad found out that while he was away in the
army, she used to have another man in the house.

93
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,256
Did you ever hear that rumour?

94
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,974
Me? No son! Did he ever, er -
did he ever say who it was?

95
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:34,188
Never. I wish I knew though!

96
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:35,866
I'll go an' fetch our coats.

97
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,782
They're in the bedroom. It's
up the stairs.

98
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,083
I know where it is.

99
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,304
That confirms it Rodders.

100
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:47,946
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:50,338
Confirms what?

102
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,120
Well look, see that little
mark there?

103
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,151
- What?
- There.

104
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,797
Oh, I can get that off, just a
minute.

105
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:07,915
No, not there - not on - on there - look, that little mark
there, look. See that confirms that these urns are...Meissen!

106
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:12,387
- No!
- Yeah, guaranteed brother!

107
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:20,477
Meissen eh? What's Meissen
then, Del?

108
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:25,291
Well it's German china innit? Mid- 19th century
according to the book.

109
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:29,795
There was a china sale at Christies the other
week. And a couple of pieces similar to these -

110
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,296
not in such a good condition

111
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:36,154
went for two hundred and fifty! These must be
worth three hundred quid of anybody's money!

112
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,394
Wait a minute, there's a paper in my bedroom with an
article about it. I'll go and fetch it.

113
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,393
An oi - you - you just keep
yer mitts off that - right?

114
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:44,978
I've got me eye on you.

115
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,695
- 300 nicker.
- Don't look very valuable.

116
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,768
Yeah, well the best one never
do, do they?

117
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,644
Oh it looks like the stuff we
used to win at the fair!

118
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,697
Oi, you break that and he'll stuff
your head down the bog.

119
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:05,442
- God Almighty!
- Grandad - what's up with ya?

120
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,888
- Just look for yourself!!
- Look at what?

121
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:09,608
What's in there!!!

122
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:17,036
- It's not a spider, is it?
- No.

123
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,605
What is it?

124
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:28,254
- It's Arthur!
- Arthur?

125
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:35,973
Trigger's grandad Arthur.
Them's his ashes. Put the lid on Rodney.

126
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,716
Oh bloody 'ell.

127
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:48,456
Del...could you come in here please?
There's something up with one of the urns.

128
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:52,027
If that soppy old git's broken it I'll stick his head
down the khazi!

129
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,755
Well - what's up?

130
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,478
It's Arthur's ashes!

131
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:03,068
Arthur's ashes? That's the
black bloke who won Wimbledon innit?

132
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:12,147
No! It's Trigger's grandad -
Arthur!

133
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,577
His ashes are in that urn.

134
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:22,856
Don't take the top off.

135
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:27,258
What's the matter with you - don't take the top off? What
you got in here, a genie or something?

136
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:38,268
Well, how d'you know it's him, eh?
It's hardly a passport photo is it!

137
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:41,859
It's him alright Del! I know
it's him.

138
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:46,191
Yes alright, alright then, so it's him. There you are look,
nothing to worry about is there!

139
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:53,797
Nothing to worry about? You don't know the full story do
yer? You see, them rumours about me and Arthur's wife -

140
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,771
well they was true. But, but nothing happened between us
Del. You've gotta believe that - nothing happened.

141
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:08,909
We were just two lonely people. Arthur
was away in the army, and yer gran had just...departed...

142
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,783
Oh no, she hadn't died - just departed.

143
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:14,904
Oh yeah, got yer.

144
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:20,542
Well we was just a bit of company for each other
that's all...But Arthur wouldn't believe that.

145
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,000
No - well he wasn't as soppy
as they made out then was he?

146
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:30,834
He put a curse on me Del. He pointed his bony finger at me
and said, 'Trotter, someday, somehow,

147
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:35,959
I'm gonna come back and haunt you!' And he had
gypsy blood in him Del.

148
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,558
You know what they say about a
gypsy's curse!

149
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,911
Oh come on, you don't believe
all that pony, do yer?

150
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,987
Yeah, I mean, it was a long time ago weren't it. You've
moved since then - he's never gonna find you now.

151
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,230
Oi, then again being a gypsy he might
have moved around a bit, eh?

152
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:54,563
Never gonna find me?

153
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,292
Look over there. He's in the
same bloody room as me!

154
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:10,233
Now don't be silly, Grandad. I mean ghosts an' all that -
it's a load of rubbish, innit?

155
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:13,980
Yeah, I mean it's - it's
greasy kids' stuff, innit?

156
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:20,243
Yeah, that's right, yeah. No, no, I'm gonna go to me room.
And get the paper alright - yeah.

157
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,091
Who left this wooden leg out here?

158
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:34,980
Don't be bloody silly Del Boy!

159
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:02,590
I mean the thing is Arthur, you and me were -
used to be friends...once!

160
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,267
So I think there ain't no point in
holding a grudge is there?

161
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:15,287
I know what happened annoyed you - it would have
annoyed me! But, well, it was a long time ago,

162
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:19,506
so why don't we just let
bygones be bygones, eh?

163
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:29,741
Well you never frightened me with all that old tosh
about a curse and what 'ave yer! I mean

164
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,903
I ain't the superstitious type. In fact I
don't know why I'm talking to you now.

165
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,869
Well I know you
can't her me, Arthur!

166
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,371
That is what you think,
Trotter.

167
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,477
Arthur? You
mean you can hear me??

168
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:08,798
You're coming through louder than a CB Rubber Duck...
Is it forgiveness that you seek, Trotter?

169
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:14,888
Well yeah. I'm really sorry
for what's happened Arthur!

170
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:19,653
Ah, but how do I know that you
mean it?

171
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:27,122
Oh I do, I do Arthur, really. I'll do anything to prove it
to you Arthur, anything you say!

172
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,377
Alright then, tell me where
your money's hidden.

173
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,301
I ain't got no money!

174
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:44,857
Oh don't give me that you lying old git! I know you're
alright for a few bob and I wanna know where it is hidden.

175
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:49,425
- It's in me suitcase under me bed.
- No it ain't, I looked.

176
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:55,431
You've been under my bed??

177
00:14:56,434 --> 00:15:05,180
I've been everywhere, Trotter. I am always with you...
On them cold winter nights when your two grandsons,

178
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:11,217
Rodney and the good-looking one, are out,
have you ever felt a... presence?

179
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:22,860
I am the chill wind that wakes you in the dead of
night. I am the - the movement in the curtains,

180
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:30,334
I am also the creaking of the floorboards.

181
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:44,893
Always with you even when you're alone,
I am keeping you company!

182
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,136
What are you doing?

183
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:00,388
You stupid little sod, that could have finished me off
that could have!

184
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,015
What's all this about?

185
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,914
Oh, Soppy here was holding a
seance with his little mate Arthur.

186
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:17,018
You never underestimate the powers of the unknown Del Boy!
All I'm saying is get them ashes out of this house.

187
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:20,735
Why don't you try an' get in touch
with Trigger, get him to take them away?

188
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,075
Well what do you think I've been trying to do all evening?
I've left messages for him everywhere.

189
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:26,488
And he'll be going
off on a three-week holiday soon!

190
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,008
Looks like we'll have to
dispose of them ourselves then.

191
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,687
Yeah, looks like it. Suppose that's the least we can do is
to give a dignified send-off.

192
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,662
Anyway we can't give anyone a
dignified send-off at three o' clock in the morning!

193
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,873
Right? So we do it tomorrow.

194
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,915
You got any ideas how we're
gonna do it?

195
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,183
Well I thought we'd put him in an envelope and post him
anonymously to a priest.

196
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,718
Bowls!

197
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,060
Well you got any better
suggestions then?

198
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,997
No, bowls! He was a life-long member of the Peckham Bowling
Club. I think he'd love to be scattered over that green.

199
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:07,845
Yeah, well, alright, that's
what we'll do then.

200
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:09,940
Well they could refuse
permission!

201
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:11,883
Yeah. Only if we ask.

202
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:17,841
Come on Del, you can't go merrily sprinkling someone's
ashes over a bowling green without being noticed!

203
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,406
They'll be playing on it!

204
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,707
That is why we're gonna do it at night, when they're not
playing on it! Right?

205
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:25,579
Alright - well I'm going to bed.

206
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:27,252
Yeah so am I. Goodnight Grandad.

207
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:32,235
Del Boy. D'you think I've made me peace
with Arthur now?

208
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:36,140
I mean that were a good idea of mine about the
bowling green weren't it?

209
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:40,781
I think he'd have liked that...And you heard me
apologize to him, didn't you.

210
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:46,626
I mean, I don't think I ain't
done nothing else that could incur his wrath have I?

211
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:53,368
No - no, of course not! Mind you there is one tiny little
thing that might have upset him.

212
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,714
What's that Del?

213
00:17:55,467 --> 00:18:01,360
Well Arthur is over there!
Sweet dreams.

214
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:22,954
What are we gonna do now?

215
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:30,606
How should I know? This was his favourite bowling club
right? This is where he spent many happy hours right.

216
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,994
So I'll just turn the urn upside down
and we'll have it away on our toes!

217
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:40,542
Eh, no, you just can't tip it upside down, it'll leave a
mound. They'll think they've got moles!

218
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:48,872
Alright then, we'll scatter it evenly about whilst we sing a
hymn or something! D'you know any hymns?

219
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,831
Er. We Three Kings of Orient.

220
00:18:55,616 --> 00:19:01,611
That is a Christmas Carol you wally! 'Ere, why don't you go
the whole hog you know and sing Jingle Bells

221
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,154
while I dance about and we sprinkle
him around?

222
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:08,438
Do what you want but hurry up.

223
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,042
Alright, I'll just say a
prayer - get down on your knees...

224
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:21,862
Dear God, high up in the sky...

225
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:53,721
Can't see a thing me dear, there's nothing there at all.
I think you're imagining it.

226
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,585
Bill, I assure you, I saw
something I...

227
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,152
You spent too much time in that bar.

228
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,652
Heave to Rodney, heave to.
This will do nicely!

229
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:13,423
Del, I've told you before and I'm gonna tell you again. You
cannot perform a burial at sea in St Catherine's Dock!

230
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:19,792
I'm not performing a burial at sea, am I? I'm performing one
of them Indian ceremonies like what they do the Ganges!

231
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:23,260
I saw it on Whicker's world, don't
worry it will be a doddle!

232
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:24,826
But this river's polluted!

233
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:26,898
Well that ain't gonna upset
Arthur is it, eh?

234
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,058
It ain't gonna do the river
much good either!

235
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:37,221
Oh, look, just shut up will yer! Sit quiet for  minute
and think - sort of - religious!

236
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:44,318
What are you doing?

237
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:50,399
- God Almighty.
- Del!

238
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,197
- What?
- What are you doing?

239
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,015
Thank Gawd for that!

240
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:03,758
Say something sensible Del. I mean don't go telling 'em
we're boat people or nothing.

241
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,408
- We're Buddhists!
- Dear God!

242
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:14,773
We're scattering some remains
- it's part of our religion.

243
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,851
Have you written permission
from the river authorities?

244
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,688
Have we written permission
from the river authorities?

245
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,822
Well of course we bloody ain't!

246
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,772
Of course we blood...No I'm
afraid not Officer.

247
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,824
You can't do it then!

248
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:39,608
Oh - oh I see - right, well,
thank you very much for all your help.

249
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,937
Let 'em get out of sight and
then I'll pull it overboard alright.

250
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,079
We'll escort you back to the
shore!

251
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:58,864
Oh right. Thank you very much. Ain't it marvelous.
There's never a copper around when you need one.

252
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,376
But the sods are always there when
you don't need em!

253
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:25,199
Magic ain't they? The old
Irish tumble-dryer!

254
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,367
Oi, you weren't were you?

255
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,209
Of course I weren't! What d'you think I am,
a Philistine or something?

256
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,678
- Could be a sign you know!
- What?

257
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:48,666
Our failure to get rid of the - contents - of that urn, could
be a sign that we didn't ought to dabble in that sort of thing!

258
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:51,555
What are you going on about?

259
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:54,659
Well, look, we're walking straight into
the unknown here ain't we!

260
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:58,808
I mean you don't know what strange
dark powers we might evoke!

261
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:04,711
Oh give over you tart! What d'you think, the bogeyman
are gonna come round and get us in our flat?

262
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,087
If they do, they'll be too knackered to do any
haunting - them lifts have broken down again!

263
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:18,067
Yeah, well, as far as I'm concerned Del you can scrub
round it, alright! Give the urns to a church jumble sale.

264
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,645
I've washed me
hands of 'em!

265
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:25,411
Rodders, listen now don't be a plonker.
They're worth 300 quid!

266
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:28,820
And you don't go giving our national treasures to
jumble sales do you?

267
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:35,320
Eh? I mean, just think what we can do with 300 quid, eh?
We could get a nice new suit each...

268
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:49,358
That thing's just sucked up
our urn. Oi!!!

269
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,829
- You've sucked up our urn!

270
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:02,107
Your urn'? Oh my Gawd!
What was he, a little kitten?

271
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:07,283
- Eh? Is he winding me up or what?
- No, he just don't understand, look.

272
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,675
It's not Ern as in Ernie,
it's urn as in you know Grecian!

273
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:15,254
Oh! Well I thought there was
something blocking me tubes.

274
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,364
I'll block his tubes permanently.

275
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:26,948
Come on
then. Is it there? You found it? Eh, that's it.

276
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:28,575
And there was the, er...

277
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:30,783
- That's it.
- Yeah.

278
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:31,874
Thanks. Right.

279
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:38,276
There you go. And be careful where you leave yer bloody
Grecian urn in future! I'll have the union in on this I will!

280
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:52,373
Oh my Gawd, it's empty. It's empty. Arthur's been sucked up
into that thing! It wasn't our fault though was it, Rodders?

281
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:58,426
No, no, it was a complete accident Del -
totally beyond our control!

282
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,349
There's no need for us to reproach ourselves!
Is there?

283
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:10,581
No, no, no, there isn't! It must have been an act of God.
I mean, don't you see the poetic irony of it?

284
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:18,298
Well Arthur used to be a road sweeper! To him this must be
like a Viking's burial!

285
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,449
Maybe he would have wanted it like this!

286
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:37,846
Maybe...I doubt it but...maybe!

287
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:51,474
Hang on, he's just coming in
now. Del Boy it's for you.

288
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,026
- Who is it?
- Trigger.

289
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,363
Trigger?? What's he want??

290
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:59,342
He said you've been leaving
messages for him to phone you!

291
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:04,424
Yeah, I know I had, that's when I wanted him to have his
grandad's ashes back! But we've got rid of them now!

292
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:08,883
'Ere, supposing he wants them - you know wants them
back after he comes back off holiday?

293
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,969
He wants me to keep
them. What am I going to say?

294
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:17,926
Er, well you just say...Oh
you'll think of something.

295
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:24,407
Oh yes, thank you very much
Rodney, you're a great help... git!

296
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:34,957
Hello Trigger, how's it going my son? Yeah? What's the
weather like? Oh foggy is it? Well it's a bit misty here...

297
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:39,582
Yeah. Where are you? You're
fogbound at Gatwick airport.

298
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,930
He's still here, he could get
in a cab and come back for it couldn't he?

299
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:51,734
Um, yeah, well Trigger - the thing is - look we've got a
bit of a problem. Yeah, it's a bit delicate. So...

300
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:56,281
Well you know, I - I'd brace yourself
if I were you - yeah.

301
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:02,221
Well you remember them urns that I had off you.
Yeah, well you see I was just sort of cleaning them up,

302
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:09,603
like, to get them ready to go to the Boy Scout's bring
'n' buy sale, and er, well,

303
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:16,828
I found your grandad's ashes in one of them...
Yeah I wondered what you wanted me to do with them?

304
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,859
Yeah well, this is the problem innit, I mean what do
you do with them?

305
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:29,968
Look, why don't you leave it up to me Trigger? Eh?
Of course it'll be a respectable and dignified ceremony!

306
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:41,137
Yeah, yeah, good boy, well you know it makes sense!
Yeah. Eh?

307

308
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:58,860
Nobody told me! Right you have a nice time Trigger
and I'll see you when you get back alright.
