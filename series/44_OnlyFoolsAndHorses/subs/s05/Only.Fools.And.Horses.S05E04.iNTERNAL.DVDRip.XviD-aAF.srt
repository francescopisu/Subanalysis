1
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,340
Oh, excuse me mate, oi give
us...oh, Gawd blimey Michael, give us...

2
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:54,100
Alright Dave?

3
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,405
Oh yeah, hello Trig. Looks
like rain don't it?

4
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:58,911
Yeah, tastes like it and all.

5
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:04,166
Oi, I heard that Trigger! I'll have you know my beer
has just won second prize in the breweries contest!

6
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,682
Yes that's right, he was narrowly beaten
by the Metropolitan Water Board!

7
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,673
Do you hear that? He was narrowly beaten
by the Metropolitan Water Board!

8
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:17,074
You see Trigger, they
sell water you know and Mike, he sells...

9
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:19,569
What is it Albert?

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,273
Now brace yourselves boys,
I just had a bit of bad news.

11
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:28,216
Your Aunt Ada's been rushed into hospital,
she's in a bad way by all accounts.

12
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:31,367
- Oh no, that's a shame innit?
- That's a choker.

13
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,455
- Who's Aunt Ada?
- Gawd knows; I don't.

14
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,973
She's me wife.

15
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:40,445
Oh that Aunt Ada? But you
ain't seen her for ages.

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,352
Yeah, she said to the rest of the family that if she
saw you again she'd kill you.

17
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:50,766
She was annoyed when she said that. You see it's
like a chapter of my life is coming to a close.

18
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,315
Yeah, I know just how she
feels though, eh?

19
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:59,030
Well that's it you see son, I don't know. 
I'd like to go and visit her and find out.

20
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,310
Well why don't ya?

21
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:02,905
'Cos she might not be as ill as they say.

22
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,763
He's really in the dumps ain't he?

23
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,292
Yeah, I know. What can
you do, eh? Still.

24
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:13,490
Sorry darling! I'll
tell you what we can do,

25
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,972
why don't we take him down
the chinky, that should cheer him up, eh Rodders?

26
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,172
Do you want to come with us Trig?

27
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,279
No, I ain't sure Del. My
niece'll be here in a minute.

28
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:21,411
She's come up from the
country for a few days.

29
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,440
You remember little Lisa don't you?

30
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,105
Lisa, oh your sister's kid?
Yeah, I remember her.

31
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:27,994
I'd better see what she
fancies doing.

32
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:31,326
Listen, I'm gonna have a chat with
Albert, jolly him up a bit.

33
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,355
Jolly him up. Thanks
Trigger, you're a pal.

34
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,834
I remember Lisa - scruffy
little mare weren't she.

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,648
She had more candlesticks
than Liberace.

36
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:46,666
Yeah, that's her. I remember her mum though,
she was a fair sort - pig-ugly, but a fair sort.

37
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:53,118
I nicknamed her Miss 999 you
know 'cos I only phoned her in an emergency.

38
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,031
See if we can do a bit of
business here, Michael...

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,833
Mike, just a moment -
Mike...Could I...Michael...

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,227
Oi, shut up will yer, 
I can't hear myself think over here.

41
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,745
- Del, it's a talent contest!
- Well she ought to be disqualified.

42
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,837
- That's the favourite!
- Oi, what's all the hollering about?

43
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,672
Well, I dunno, I just told
her to shut up.

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,548
'Ere, listen Michael, now that we're over here, I've got 
a beautiful ultraviolet sunbed back at the flat.

45
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:25,432
Now they retail normally at 375, 
it's yours for 120.

46
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,674
Just think of it eh, your own personal home
solarium?

47
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:30,826
I don't want it.

48
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,102
I can see that you're in
two minds so I'll tell you what I'll do.

49
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:38,535
I have here a super delux modern 
plug-in type telephone

50
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,202
and I'm gonna give it to you free 
with your home-solarium.

51
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,756
I can't say fairer than
that, because this is my last one.

52
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,751
- I don't want it.
- I'll chuck in an extension.

53
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:50,373
- I don't want it.
- Yes or no?

54
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,967
Do me a favour Del...please.

55
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,519
I'm doing you a favour...

56
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,582
And I nearly had him then.

57
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:01,715
I could see he was weakening.
Is it worth stopping here for another one?

58
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:05,185
No it ain't. Come on Rodney -
let's get going.

59
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,819
That bird over there's giving me the
right hump. Oi, shut up.

60
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,505
Del. Lisa's here.

61
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,019
Not now Trigger, we ain't got time. Say hello 
for us, will you? Come on Rodders - let's get going.

62
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,001
- Hello Del.
- Hello darling...Bloody hell!

63
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,063
That ain't that scruffy
little thing with the funny drawers is it?

64
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,468
Yeah, must be, yeah.

65
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:32,214
Bloody 'ell...Are you off
then, are yer?

66
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,300
No, no, no, I think I'll
stay for another one.

67
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,828
Are you gonna go down the chinky with
Uncle Albert then?

68
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:43,094
I don't fancy it - all
that batter and that.

69
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,968
Well, out of my way, come on,
get out of me way.

70
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,319
- You piss off.
- Look, there's a pound down there, look there.

71
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,037
Hello darling.

72
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,845
Hello, Del. Oh it's been such
a long time.

73
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,713
Yeah it has innit? Haven't you got
big, eh? No, I mean you've grown up.

74
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:03,437
- Well I'm 25 now.
- You're not! 25 now...

75
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,847
- Hello Lisa, do you remember me?
- Hello. How are you?

76
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,114
- Oh fine, I'm really good.
- Oh that's nice.

77
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,202
Who is he?

78
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,360
Eh? Who him? That's little
Rodney. Don't you remember little Rodney.

79
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,479
You used to
play with him.

80
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,174
- Oh, of course. You've changed.
- Yes, so have you.

81
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:20,550
I'll say she has changed.
Cor you are a big girl...

82
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,431
Why don't we go and sit down
over here, and have a little chat.

83
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,532
No, no. I'll come with you.
I'll come with you.

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,001
- Do you remember the old days?
- Thank you Rodney.

85
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,996
Oh it's lovely seeing you two
again.

86
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,520
You know I always remember
that day - ooh it was years and years ago –

87
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:43,204
you drove round to me Nan's house in a
brand-new-three-wheeled van.

88
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:47,271
I remember him saying to
Uncle Trigger, this time next year it'll be a Mercedes.

89
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,819
I was so impressed...Did you
ever get the Mercedes?

90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,904
Na, na, I went off 'em...
I got a nice little two-seater now!

91
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:58,887
Two seats, three
wheels! It's the same van innit?

92
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:05,998
That's right, I let Rodney borrow it sometimes when he's
behaved himself, 'cos he can't afford a car of his own!

93
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:12,046
I mean, what kid can of his age, eh? So you're living
down in the country then, eh?

94
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,248
Just outside Winchester. You
still livin' in the same place?

95
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,405
Yeah, yeah. we're still
there.

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,065
Listen, you know before you go home you ought
to come round to the flat.

97
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,753
We can have a chat about
old times, you know. You can stay for tea.

98
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,017
Oh thanks, I'd love to.

99
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,811
I was gonna invite you to
tea an' all. How about tomorrow night?

100
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:31,805
Fine.

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,965
Yes tomorrow's fine by me sweetheart.

102
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:38,609
No, I invited Lisa for
tomorrow night.

103
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:42,006
Yes, I know you did Rodney, 
but don't forget I did invite Lisa first.

104
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,139
Derek, you clearly heard me
invite Lisa for tea tomorrow night.

105
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,297
But I invited her first.

106
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:51,342
Look, why don't we have tea together?
Then the three of us can talk about the old times.

107
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:54,926
- Oh, good.
- Fine.

108
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,129
Hurry up will you, I want
'alf an hour under there.

109
00:06:57,406 --> 00:07:01,674
'Ere, these ultraviolet rays
contain vitamin E don't they?

110
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,731
I read somewhere that vitamin
Es are good for an 'angover.

111
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,967
Yeah, well you made a right
berk of yourself at the talent contest didn't yer?

112
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,673
Getting up on stage and
singing that stupid song.

113
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,973
What are you on about, I won!

114
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,133
You won??

115
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,800
Del, you know who
won the talent contest?

116
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,149
- Who did?
- Roy Orbison here!

117
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,964
Must have been a sympathy
vote!

118
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,488
Anyway, I've got all the grub in for me and
Lisa's tea tonight.

119
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,109
Yes, well I made a contribution too.

120
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:45,421
Oh, have ya? Well I got chicken Italiano, fruit salad
and Dream Topping to follow and what've you bought?

121
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:48,034
Cheese.

122
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,461
Cheese! Cheese? Well, it's a
good job I bought all this grub then innit, eh?

123
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:57,289
If it was left up to you the poor
little cow'd have been down for Welsh rabbit.

124
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,292
Well, if you put your hand in your pocket every so
often and give me some proper money.

125
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,833
Listen, I earn the money in
this family.

126
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:03,688
Why don't you two pack it
in?

127
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,749
God, you look like a geriatric  ball-boy.

128
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,863
You two were niggling  each
other last night and you've been bickering all morning,

129
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,815
I'm fed up with yer. I'm
going down the Legion.

130
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,097
Anyway, I better make sure we've got
enough Smash in for Lisa's tea.

131
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:24,465
Right, I'm gonna have a
quick tone-up, a nice shower and I am sorted!

132
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,992
Oi, how'd you turn this
thing on for 'alf an hour?

133
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,009
- On the end there.
- Right, got it.

134
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,573
Oh, this is lovely!

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,839
Listen to me Rodney. I told you once, you remember, that
Grandad and I didn't speak to each other for years?

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,536
Well that was all over a
woman! It was yer Aunt Ada!

137
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,604
You're not gonna sing again
are you?

138
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,978
I remember me and yer Grandad,
we were just like you and Del Boy.

139
00:08:55,536 --> 00:09:00,965
We weren't just brothers, we was mates,
went everywhere together, got up to some right capers.

140
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,942
Then one night we met Ada at the local
palais.

141
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:09,864
She was a beautiful woman, 
a bit like Ginger Rodgers.

142
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,602
Last time I saw her
she looked more like Fred Astaire!

143
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:20,087
Well, we both had a couple of dances with her,
then we both wanted to take her home.

144
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:22,184
We ended up fighting in the street over her. 

145
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:29,430
He never spoke to me from that day to...
He never spoke to me ever again.

146
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:35,978
I'm frightened history's gonna repeat itself. 
I don't wanna see that happen to you and Del.

147
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:41,965
Bloody kids! 

148
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:47,861
Oi, Rodney! I'm gonna whip down the shops and get another
packet of Smash and some Brut so I want you to...

149
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:59,844
Ah, he's gone to sleep bless him! So you wanna get
a nice tan for the girl then do you?

150
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,762
I'll give you a nice tan alright.

151
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,235
Oh, not too much I got to be
up early in the morning.

152
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,296
Just a little topperooni - there we go.

153
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:20,468
Come on Rodney. Oi, come on,
bring your cheese.

154
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:24,047
I really think Rodney should
go to hospital with his face.

155
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,033
Yeah, I know, I've been
telling him that for years!

156
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,118
- Does your face hurt?
- Only when I smile.

157
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:53,320
Listen Rodney, I wouldn't stand about in that suit too
long if I were you, not with your head!

158
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,823
- Why not?
- Well, he looks like a Swan Vesta! 

159
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,520
How's your mum these days Lisa?

160
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,512
Oh, she's fine thank you.

161
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,562
Did you know that years and
years ago, Del used to take your mum out?

162
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:13,128
Oh, I didn't know that.

163
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,371
Yeah, yeah, we were just
little tiny kids then.

164
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,254
What was it you nicknamed
her, Del?

165
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:21,879
Em... It was the Rose of
Peckham.

166
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,241
My Mum??? I can't wait to
tell her.

167
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,263
Well, that's funny because he
told me in the pub...

168
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,387
D'you like going to the flicks?

169
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:34,121
Oh the cinema, oh yeah. 
Have you seen An Officer and a Gentleman?

170
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,235
Oh yeah, yeah.

171
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,629
Oh that Richard Gere, isn't
he fabulous?

172
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,505
- Yeah, he's alright.
- I like what he wears.

173
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,991
Oh when he was wearing his
uniform. Oh God, I went all goose-pimpley.

174
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:47,268
You know there definitely is something
about a man in a uniform.

175
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:51,804
Well you take after your mum there, she used to go
out with this geezer from the Gas Board!

176
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:58,450
I used to be in the army!
Well, cadets!

177
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,950
- I used to be a paratrooper!
- Really?

178
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,509
Didn't I Rodney??

179
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,359
Well you've made a few drops
in your time Del.

180
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:11,883
I don't know how you could do it. I've got these
friends back home who belong to a hang-gliding club.

181
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,875
Oh, yeah hang-gliding, well
I love all that.

182
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,382
They're always asking me to
try but just the thought of it terrifies me.

183
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:21,179
There's nothing to it. No,
I used to free-fall from 20,000 feet.

184
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:22,019
No.

185
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,573
Yeah, I didn't used to
open my chute 'til I saw the tops of the trees.

186
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,148
- Oh God.
- At night.

187
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,622
You also had your feet tied
together and a hand over one eye, didn't you!!

188
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,811
- One night my chute didn't open at all!
- What happened?

189
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:42,306
I had a bad landing! But fortunately
they teach you to fall properly! It was alright.

190
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:46,945
You know it's funny but I've always imagined
paratroopers to be...Well, taller!

191
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:50,913
Yeah well, he used to be six foot one, 
but like he said, he had a bad landing!

192
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,272
Thank you, thank you very
much Rodney for your observations.

193
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,242
Get out in the kitchen and
put the kettle on will yer?

194
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,073
Oh no, no. I've got to
be going.

195
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,226
Listen, I'll walk you home,
eh?

196
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,431
No, no, no Rodney, you can't
do that.

197
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:09,758
You can't stand around street corners with your face,
the traffic'll be waiting for you to change to green!

198
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,362
No listen, I'll
give you a lift home.

199
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,233
Oh that's nice of you Del.

200
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,336
L'etat c'est moi! As the
French would say.

201
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,678
What else could I do for a charming
lady?

202
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,217
Why thank you kind sir!

203
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,549
Not at all. I'll just go
and get the keys shall I? 

204
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:28,535
I'm going, I'm going.

205
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,983
Well, it's been really nice
seeing you again after all this time.

206
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,313
Oh I've enjoyed it so much.
You know - shopping and meeting old friends.

207
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,086
Yeah, what time you off
tomorrow?

208
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,093
I get the 10 o'clock train
from Waterloo.

209
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:44,419
I've got to be home by 12, 
I'm meeting those friends I was telling you about.

210
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:45,919
What, the hang-gliders?

211
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:47,426
- I'll just get me jacket.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,060
Why don't me and Del
drive you home tomorrow?

213
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,477
I couldn't ask you to do
that!

214
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,518
No, no, we'd like it. We'd
have a nice day in the country!

215
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,333
Del'll jump at the chance.

216
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,699
And I was thinking, it's Del's 46th
birthday soon and I'd love to give him a real surprise.

217
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,032
- D'you know what his ambition is?
- What?

218
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:19,936
To hang-glide! Well, you know, 
being the old ex-paratrooper it's only natural innit?

219
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:24,574
So d'you reckon your mates could arrange for
him to have a little flight?

220
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,975
No problem, they'd be delighted.

221
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,528
Oh that'll be great! 
I can't wait to see his little face.

222
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,370
It'll be our little secret
though, eh?

223
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,606
Sure, oh me bag.

224
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:41,528
Yes, I can't wait to see
his little face.

225
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:43,983
What?

226
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,256
You want me to go up on one
of them wing things?

227
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:53,872
No, no, no, not today darling,
you see I'm not in the mood.

228
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,650
You can't wait to get up there can you? 
I can see it in your eyes!

229
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,339
Really?

230
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,697
Andy, come over here and meet
some friends of mine.

231
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,916
I'd like you to meet Del
and Rodney.

232
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:08,702
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Watcha son.

233
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,863
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

234
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,341
Sorry, it's just that you
look sort of flushed.

235
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:20,963
No, no, it's alright. 
It's just his great-grandad was a Comanche.

236
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,034
Well, Lisa tells me you used
to be a paratrooper.

237
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,650
Well it's many, many years ago
now like, you know what I mean?

238
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:36,516
Well, I've done a bit of free-falling myself, nothing
in your calibre of course, but it was great fun.

239
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:38,333
Yes, triffic!

240
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,495
Well, whenever you're ready
Del.

241
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:49,113
No, no, no, it's alright, I don't wanna spoil
your fun Andy, I'll stay here and just watch, eh.

242
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,718
Listen to me Derek Trotter.

243
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:56,301
I've arranged all this specially for you! 
It's my way of saying thank you for the lovely meal last night.

244
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:57,970
I wish you could have seen
it Andy.

245
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,074
Hang around and you might!

246
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,006
Andy doesn't mind you borrowing 
his equipment, do you?

247
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,728
No, no, it's a pleasure. 
And we've got some great thermals today.

248
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:11,045
Thermals? Oh what a shame,
I'm just wearing me ordinary Y-fronts.

249
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:14,430
No, no, thermals, you know, warm air.

250
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,090
He's just having you on!

251
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,547
Oh I see! We'll get everything ready then.

252
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,794
Yeah, okay. 

253
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,282
What am I gonna do?

254
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,695
I don't know! Dear oh dear,
oh dear, oh dear, hat a pickle!

255
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:38,600
I mean really, it's a bit of a shame you
ever said you was a paratrooper.

256
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,027
I wish I'd kept my bloody
mouth shut.

257
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,454
What's that Andy want to go sticking
his hooter into my affairs for eh, eh?

258
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,904
Well he thinks he's doing
you a favour, don't he?

259
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,679
I'm gonna land him a doughboy right round the
lug hole before he's much older!

260
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,492
What am I gonna do Rodney? I can't tell 'em
I'm scared can I, eh, eh?

261
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:03,165
No, no, you'd make yourself look a right dipstick
in front of everyone.

262
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,118
You don't fancy having a little
fly then?

263
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,743
No I do not. I prefer to keep
my feet firmly on the old terra-cotta!

264
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:15,468
I'll tell 'em
I'm not feeling very well!

265
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:20,125
Eh, you can't do that! 
A Green Beret with an headache!

266
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,501
This is one little problem you're
gonna have to work out on your own Del, innit?

267
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,712
See Rodney, now listen to me.

268
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:34,009
I know we haven't been seeing eye to eye for the
last few days, but listen to me,

269
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,637
we are brothers
after all, ain't we?

270
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:39,619
I mean it's blood! It's like Uncle Albert said, 
brothers shouldn't fall out over a woman.

271
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,933
Didn't he, eh?Come on. 
What d'you reckon? Eh Rodney, eh?

272
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:47,434
You're right Del! No, you're right. 
I mean it's stupid arguing, innit?

273
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,501
You know it makes sense, 
don't you eh?

274
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,711
Come on, help me out of this mess Rodney, please. 
Come on, any ideas? Anything? Eh?

275
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,984
Alright, alright we'll just
have a look at the problems, right.

276
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,253
On the one hand
right, you don't want to fly!

277
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,348
But on the other hand 
you want to keep your pride intact?

278
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:14,461
- Of course I do.
- Right, right, I've got it.

279
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,542
You pretend to be dead keen
to get up in them old clouds right!

280
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:23,312
You put on all the gear, put yourself
in the glider thing,

281
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,929
then at the last minute I come
over from the van,

282
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:31,984
rushing up and say we've had an
urgent call come through on our car-phone.

283
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:39,944
That's brill innit eh? 
But we ain't got a car phone, have we Dopey?

284
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,730
We ain't even got a ruddy
car, look.

285
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:47,723
Who's gonna know any
different?

286
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:53,970
And then I say you've gotta rush back to
London immediately, right,

287
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,994
and you act all disappointed, you go
 'Oh no, but what can you do?'

288
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,011
Then we're in the van and
we're away!

289
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,952
Oh yeah, good boy. Well
done Rodders, well done.

290
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,255
Listen, you are gonna stay
here though aren't yer?

291
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,499
- I'll be right here, mate.
- Good boy, good boy.

292
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,774
Hey Andy, come on then, hurry up, 
I'm getting a bit impatient to be off ain't I?

293
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,308
He don't know does he?

294
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:28,909
Everything alright?

295
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:30,886
Oh yeah, beautiful darling,
beautiful.

296
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,793
Now do you remember everything
I told you about controlling the glider?

297
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:36,517
Yeah, don't worry Andy, it's all up there. 
Down there for dancing.

298
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:46,907
What d'you reckon, all the thermal and all that
alright up there Andy?

299
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,845
No, no, it's one of the best
days of the year. 

300
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:51,069
- That was exactly what I thought.
- Well, whenever you're ready Del.

301
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,343
Ah right, cushty.

302
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,659
- You're switched on...
- Yeah, it's all working, yeah.

303
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,858
Is that our phone I can
hear ringing Rodney?

304
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,274
I said is that our phone 
I can hear ringing?

305
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:36,284
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. We ain't got a carphone!

306
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:51,034
Get up as high as you can Del. 
You might get a tan.

307
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:57,333
I will get you for this
Rodney, just see if I don't.

308
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,791
Are you going Del?

309
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:09,419
Yeah I'm going...
Oh my good Gawd! Oh bloody Hell!

310
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:29,445
They do this for fun? Oh Gawd,
please let me get down safely.

311
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:31,911
Please God, let me get down from here.

312
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,339
What's he doing?

313
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,505
Well, where's he going? 
I told him to stay close to the ridge.

314
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:43,160
- Why, what's over there?
- He's heading out to sea.

315
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:58,115
Get that down you! He's been missing for 12 hours!
12 hours, that's nearly half a day!

316
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:01,451
I know, I've got a GCE in
Maths, haven't I?

317
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:09,933
- Shall I answer it son?
- Yes please.

318
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,314
- Watcha Dave.
- Watcha Trig.

319
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:21,787
You alright?

320
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,564
Yeah, I'm fine, this is nothing! 
Have they found him?

321
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:32,116
- Yeah... They found him Dave!
- Eh. Where?

322
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,552
He crashed into a television
transmitter in Redhill.

323
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:40,936
They rushed him to the local
hospital. X-rays and that.

324
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,576
They tried to phone his next of kin - but they couldn't
get through, so they phoned the pub.

325
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,893
Me and Mike got a
cab out there.

326
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:51,947
We'll see you for the fare son.

327
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,155
Na, that's alright. We got a
Green Line back.

328
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,842
But what happened? Has he
broken anything?

329
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:03,043
Well they reckon the aerial's
beyond repair.

330
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:08,372
I mean Del, 
how's Del?

331
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,992
You'd better ask him yourself Dave.

332
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,669
See you got home safely then
Rodney?

333
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:27,213
- Yeah. Are you alright Del?
- Is he winding me up or what?

334
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:35,767
No, no, he's just a bit concerned that's all Del. 
Here, are you alright?

335
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,341
I'm fine!!

336
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:39,145
So what did the hospital
say son?

337
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:41,537
They said...

338
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:43,845
They said I may never walk again!

339
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:52,969
Rodney, Rodney, my brother, I know that in your
heart of hearts you never meant to disable me!

340
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:56,393
And I just want you to know I
won't hold it against you.

341
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,473
Alright.

342
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:14,047
Alright, what I meant was, I'm sorry 
I let you lay under our home-solarium all that time 

343
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:16,212
and made you go a bit red.

344
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:19,914
I suppose, alright, this is my
punishment, innit?

345
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:23,954
Spend the rest of my life in
this wheelchair!

346
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,758
Still, it could have been
worse Del!

347
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:29,093
How?

348
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,015
My gran had one with a
squeaky wheel!

349
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:41,421
This is all a bit sick innit?
I mean, you might fool these three, but not me bruv!

350
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,283
What do you mean Rodney?

351
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:44,684
Oh come off it Del!

352
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:49,167
Two pina coladas then you'll put on
your Eric Clapton LP and you'll be up jiving won't ya?

353
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,615
I don't believe this! 
I don't believe what he's doing to me!

354
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:54,384
He's torn my world in
half and now he's having a pop at me!

355
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:55,963
You're right out of order
son!

356
00:24:55,998 --> 00:25:00,496
Oh listen to me. Hospitals
do not send home paralysed people by bus!!

357
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:10,509
What is it you are after Del, sympathy
from Lisa or a disabled sticker for the van, eh?

358
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,166
You listen to me you vicious
little git! I may never walk again for the rest of...

359
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,885
Although I must admit, I'm
getting some feeling back.

360
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,814
You should never tell them
sort of lies Del!

361
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,801
You made us go all the way out to Redhill 
and there was nothing wrong with you?

362
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:35,688
Don't blame me, it was him.
I just wanted to get my own back on this plonker.

363
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:40,915
Yeah, but when you fancied a smoke on the bus
you made me carry you up to the top deck.

364
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:45,475
Don't blame me! Don't blame me Trig! 
Just blame him!

365
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,698
Rodney, I was up there three hours!
Three bloody hours!

366
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:51,748
I did the
loop-the-loop over Dimchurch.

367
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:57,410
Little kids were shouting at me, 
'There goes a spaceman, a spaceman.'

368
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,581
Finally, just when I'd given up hope 
I clattered into an aerial thing 

369
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,795
and fell 50 foot to the ground.

370
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,761
It was only by the grace of God that I
landed on something soft.

371
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,785
Yeah, I noticed the bruising
around your head.

372
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:18,572
It was not my head! I landed on a very unfortunate 
and very unsuspecting courting couple.

373
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:20,996
You're kidding?

374
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:22,522
No, I wish I was. 

375
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:29,730
Due to your vicious mind and general wallyness, 
they've had to put their wedding back six months.

376
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:33,764
I've had to pay for a new sun-roof in their Sierra

377
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:38,408
and that's regardless of what
Radio Rentals are gonna do me for for the aerial!

378
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:42,612
Would it help if I said I'm sorry?

379
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,408
No it would not!

380
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:49,279
Talking of weddings, that reminds me. 
Lisa has invited you to hers.

381
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:53,569
Well that's all I need innit, eh? 
That's another trip down to bleedin' Hampshire...

382
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:56,823
Lisa's getting married?

383
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:02,889
Yeah, in a couple of months, that's what she came up for -
to buy herself a wedding dress in Oxford street.

384
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,364
This is all a bit sudden
innit?

385
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:09,272
No. She's been engaged for
over a year - some geezer called Andy.

386
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:11,429
That's a bit of good news
Trig!

387
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:15,123
Here, I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll open the
pub and we'll have a little celebration drink.

388
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:16,712
Yeah nice one Mike. You
coming Albert?

389
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:17,977
Yeah I'll be there son.

390
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,921
I suppose you two will be
joining us?

391
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,568
So she was engaged all the time! 

392
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,533
What a couple of wallies!
