1
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,365
Now come on, listen to this.
I've come here to sell my wares.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,173
I haven't come here to be laughed at,
chaffed at or generally mucked about.

3
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,115
I've come to sell my wares
and they're guaranteed.

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,166
Guaranteed to cure hard core,
soft core and pimples on the tongue.

5
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,139
Right, now, what we got here today,
I tell you what we'll do

6
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:06,356
we've got the Musta F80 in-car radio cassette player
as recommended by Nigel Mansell.

7
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,901
No no no, straight up. I wouldn't wind you up would I,
on something as important as this?

8
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,366
This is solid state of the arts technology this,

9
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:21,238
and this is none of your Japanese or German rubbish –
no sir, this is actually made in Albania.

10
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:26,551
Listen, let me show you, let me point out
some of the advantages of this wonderful machine.

11
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:34,069
It's got multiple pre-sets, synthesised tuners,
digital-scan, auto-reverse graphic equalizer.

12
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:39,743
It's got MW, FM, VHF, LCD, RMS, B&Q and ICI

13
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:46,473
And it comes complete with two, not one, two,
count them, one...two quadraphonic speakers!

14
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:53,756
And I am also giving away free
with this technological miracle one Kylie Minogue LP.

15
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:56,693
Wait a minute. Only £10.99.

16
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,890
No, listen, don't walk away,
you could regret this for the rest of your life

17
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:07,912
I tell you what I'm gonna do. Forget the Kylie Minogue LP.
Right, ten quid... ten quid, first come, first served.

18
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:20,301
- Hello, Albert.
- Oh, hello, love.

19
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:25,594
- What are you up to?
- I am Trotters Independent Traders' executive look-out.

20
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:29,193
The day Rodney went to work
for your Dad I got promotion.

21
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,467
Yeah? Wish it was that easy for me.

22
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:34,132
What, have the bank said something
about your new job?

23
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,626
No. I had to sit an interview yesterday.

24
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,866
My boss said he'll speak on my behalf,
so it's fingers crossed.

25
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,793
You'll get your promotion, Cassandra,
I can feel it in me bones.

26
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:47,065
It'll make a lovely anniversary present for you.

27
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:51,929
Talking of anniversary presents,
I know what Del's got for you.

28
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,482
But, you know me, I ain't saying nothing-yeah,
don't wanna spoil the surprise.

29
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:59,039
- Oh go on, spoil it.
- Alright then.

30
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,762
It's a car radio.

31
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:07,455
- A car ra..! I've already got a radio in my car.
- Have you? It'll do for Rodney then.

32
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,133
Oh yeah, it'll look really
good on his bike, won't it?

33
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,731
Well, maybe Del's looking for the future.

34
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:17,100
When you get your new job you
and Rodney'll become a two car family.

35
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:20,873
I think it'll be a long time before Rodney and I
become a two car family.

36
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:25,072
No, but you've only been married a year,
first two or three are always a struggle.

37
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:30,006
It was the same with me and my wife - yeah,
she used to write and say me how tough it was.

38
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,154
- What do you mean, she used to write?
- Well, I was away at sea - there was a war on.

39
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:41,777
Look. I found this morning at the bottom of my duffel bag.
I ain't seen it for years, I thought I'd lost it.

40
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:44,595
Look, Uncle Albert,
I’ve only got one hour for my lunch!

41
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:51,705
It was midnight as we sailed in to this little harbour
on board this Greek herring trawler - that was our cover, see.

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,568
Oi, what is it your game?
You're supposed to be on look-out

43
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,363
! I haven't seen you look at anything!

44
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:02,073
The entire massed bands
of the Metropolitan Police force

45
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,294
could march through here playing 'I Shot the Sheriff'
and your wouldn't see nothing!

46
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,801
It was Cassandra,
she wanted to know where I won me medal.

47
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:14,283
Yeah, it was my fault, Del. I'm sorry. Anyway,
I'd better be going, I've got to get some shopping in.

48
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,486
Oh yeah, what's that for, tomorrow night's anniversary
dinner, eh? What time d'you want us there?

49
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:23,516
I thought Rodney said we'd take you
and Albert out to a restaurant at a later date.

50
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:26,508
Yes, I know and I told Rodney
that that was far too expensive.

51
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,158
No, you gotta look after your pennies now,
sweetheart.

52
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:33,453
Thing is, Del, it's not so much an anniversary dinner,
it's more business

53
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:38,386
I've invited a couple of people along from the bank.
I'm worried you'll get bored.

54
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:45,498
No, you don't have to worry about us!
This is your night, and we don't want to let you down.

55
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:51,493
- You're family now. Alright?
- Yeah. Eight o'clock okay?

56
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:53,463
Yeah, lovely jubbly!

57
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:58,811
- Hello Del, hello darling.
- Hi, Marlene. Can I look?

58
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:03,436
Yeah, if you want, but I warn you he ain't at his best,
miserable little git.

59
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:08,065
He's missing his morning nap,
ain't you darling?

60
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:16,579
Oh he's most probably got wind.
Ah, look at him.

61
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:21,748
He's a little cracker, ain't he, eh?
Does remind me of Boycie.

62
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,621
- Yeah, what, the eyes?
- No, no, the wind.

63
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,270
- What have you named him?
- We've called him Tyler.

64
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,013
Tyler... Nice!

65
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:35,819
Of course, if it had been a girl
they would have called it Ruth...

66
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:38,189
Then it would have been know
as Ruth Tyler.

67
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:43,202
- Really?
- No, it's only...

68
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,577
What's up with you two?

69
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,632
Oh hello, Albert?
Cor blimey, that's not another medal, is it?

70
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:57,333
Yeah, an act of bravery in the Aegean Sea.
I was on this Greek herring trawler,

71
00:05:57,368 --> 00:06:02,173
when suddenly out of the darkness
come this German torpedo boat!

72
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,839
Albert, you must have come back with more medals
than the Russian Olympic squad!

73
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:12,262
Oh I didn't ask for 'em!
They kept giving 'em to me.

74
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,848
Oh, shut up, Tyler!

75
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:19,818
Giss him here. Giss him here.
I'm a natural with kids.

76
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:24,483
- Alright everyone. I'm off then. Nice to see you.
- Yes alright Cassandra. Ta-ta now love. Bye.

77
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:30,529
That Cassandra's a nice girl, ain't she?
Rodney was really lucky marrying her.

78
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:35,123
Yeah, and I was lumbered
with he old man of the sea!

79
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:40,021
Hey, talking of sea! Boycie's just told me
you lot are off on a beano to Margate!

80
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:43,977
Oh what, the Jolly Boys Outing?
Yeah, well we go every couple of years. I organise it.

81
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:48,639
If he gets up to anything with a bird in Margate
I am holding you responsible!

82
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,200
Oh he won't get up to nothing!
We'll only be there a couple of hours.

83
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:55,844
He don't need a couple of hours!
Thirty seconds does him!

84
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,263
So there I was at the wheel of this
Greek herring trawler sailing into the unknown.

85
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:09,354
It was twenty three hundred hours
and the night was blacker than a bailiff's heart.

86
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,407
So where's Rodney working now?

87
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,918
Oh he's working with Alan - you know,
Cassandra's Dad, down at the printing works.

88
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,165
What, what - he managed to keep that job?

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,514
Oh yeah! And he's doing very nicely.
Works in the computer section.

90
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:28,804
They had a trainee start last month,
showing him all the ropes.

91
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:35,217
- Yeah, Rodney'll soon pick it up.
- No, no, Rodney's showing the trainee all the ropes!

92
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,063
Then out the darkness came
this German torpedo boat.

93
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:47,951
Quick as a flash - and without giving a second's thought
to me own safety or anyone else's,

94
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:53,378
I swung the wheel to port and sent the trawler
right across the German boat's bow!

95
00:07:53,688 --> 00:08:00,125
We were slightly damaged but Jerry sunk within a minute...
That's why they gave me this medal.

96
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,871
One day, if you're lucky,
you might win one of these.

97
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:11,404
But then again - hopefully not.

98
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:19,980
No, What you've gotta understand, Marlene,
is that Rodney's in charge of the whole computer section!

99
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,703
I don't know
where that firm would be without Rodney!

100
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:28,198
Shit!

101
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,672
That's the second time
I've done that today!

102
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,706
How is it going, Rodney?

103
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:53,532
Oh, fine.

104
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,906
- You got those print-outs ready for the bank yet?
- Shouldn’t be long, Alan.

105
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:01,029
I'd be very careful if I was you,
you've wiped them off once today already.

106
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,544
No problem.

107
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,064
So, what have you bought Cassandra
for your anniversary then?

108
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:14,758
Oh it was... clothing.

109
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:19,312
Clothing, lovely. Well I expect I'll see it tomorrow night,
she's bound to wear it at the dinner.

110
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,730
- I don't think she will, Alan.
- Well why not?

111
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,914
I really am looking forward
to your anniversary dinner.

112
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,522
Yeah, well, so was I till I found out
she's invited that Stephen and Joanne.

113
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:42,151
Oh no, you gotta be fair son, you know. Stephen is
the assistant head of the bank's overseas investment bureau.

114
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:46,747
He's Cassy's boss! She's applied for promotion
so she's gotta stay on his good side.

115
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:52,724
I know! But he's such a yuppy! It's all that,
'Oh yeah, for sure'.

116
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,265
And all that, 'okay, can I just run this past you'.
Prat!

117
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,633
Yeah, yeah. I can't stand him either.

118
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:02,137
But he's the sort of man that might do
the company some good one of these days.

119
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:06,816
I'd rather have him inside the tent spitting out
than outside the tent spitting in! Understand?

120
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,746
Yeah, course I do.

121
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:15,461
Look, if Cassy is lucky enough to get this promotion,
one of her jobs and one of her duties

122
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:17,180
is going to be entertaining at home.

123
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,743
So she's invited Stephen and his wife along
to prove that she can throw a good dinner party.

124
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,756
Yeah, I know. Look, take no notice of me,
right, I'm just overreacting.

125
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,339
Well, we'll all be on our best behaviour,
make a good impression for our little Cassy, eh?

126
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:39,689
- Alan! I've invited Del and Albert!
- You've what?

127
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,563
Well, I had to, well, they're family!

128
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:51,436
Oh well, I don't suppose she'd have been very happy
in her new job anyway.

129
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,945
Excuse me, sir.

130
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:04,288
It's just all that data you had on your screen,
it's on my one now!

131
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,099
Well, of course it is!

132
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,091
They don't know they're
born, do they?

133
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:26,418
Alright, at first glance it may appear
to be slightly off the wall.

134
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:31,117
- But the word in the city is big bucksville.
- Right, so what is the big secret then?

135
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,564
Stephen's about to tell you
if you give him half a chance.

136
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,435
Alan, this is no stock market secret
or insider information.

137
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,998
It is merely my humble opinion - for what it's worth.
Okay, let me run this one past you.

138
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,222
Try and get you heads round this.
I'm going to say one word,

139
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:48,654
but bear in mind I am talking 'future',
long term investment, yeah?

140
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:51,180
- It's 'hang in there' time.
- Yeah, for sure.

141
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:57,840
Okay, this is the bottom line, take it on board if you wish.
The word is - Africa!

142
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:03,506
Africa! I'll make a note of that in my Filofax,
if I may, Stephen. You got a pen?

143
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:10,286
No. The two main ladies in my life, Joanne and Cassy,
know where I'm coming from on this one.

144
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:14,180
Stephen was telling me about the projected world
growth areas the other day over brunch.

145
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:20,411
And Africa is where it's at. Recently Joanne and I spent
a little time down in Afrique sur-mer.

146
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:25,747
- Fabrique belgique.
- This is it.

147
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,231
Fruit produce, yeah? With the introduction of new technology
we could be talking returns of left-field proportions.

148
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:43,293
- Take the banana crop alone, we are into mega-growth.
- Well, you can't go wrong, Stephen.

149
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:48,890
- The bigger the banana the better, that's my motto.
- For sure. And statistically we are talking...

150
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,963
- What?
- Well, what I mean is that,

151
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:56,687
it's easier to sell bigger bananas
than little 'uns! Ain't it Rodney, eh?

152
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:02,057
Del, I think when Stephen talks about 'growth'
he's talking about financial investment,

153
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,180
not about the actual size of the banana.

154
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:10,334
Oh yeah. No... yeah... no it's...
I just wasn't sure.

155
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,543
- Coffee, everyone?
- Ah, lovely jubbly.

156
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,496
- Mummy, I was about to do that.
- That's alright, darling.

157
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:19,115
You were talking with Stephen,
so I thought I might as well make myself useful.

158
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,662
It's a lovely little flat, Cassandra,
everything is so... well, so well coordinated.

159
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:26,814
That's 'cos Rodney has got a GCE in Art.

160
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,461
Liqueurs, anyone? Dad?

161
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,981
Oh yeah, yeah, I'll have a scotch,
please love.

162
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,442
No, make that a small port please.

163
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,554
- Roddy?
- Roddy!

164
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,500
Roddy! Oi Albert,
she only calls him Roddy, look.

165
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,367
- Derek?
- Mm... brandy, please, Pamela.

166
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:51,598
- Armagnac?
- Yeah, that'll do if you're out of brandy.

167
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,249
- I'll have a rum, dear.
- Yes, we know!

168
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:59,724
- I'll stay with the wine.
- Yeah, same here.

169
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,991
- I've gotta be up early in the morning, playing baseball.
- Oh, baseball! Yeah!

170
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:09,549
- I love it. I always watch it on Channel Four.
- You don't like baseball!

171
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:17,616
- You've always called it silly boys rounders!
- Yeah, that was before that I knew it was 'in'!

172
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:22,072
Nowadays it's the sort of game that guys
like me and Stephen enjoy.

173
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:27,890
- How d'you mean? Guys like me and Stephen?
- Well, you know, yuppies.

174
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,700
Derek, I am not a yuppy.

175
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,333
- You are, Stephen, you are! Guaranteed.
- No, no, really...

176
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:43,757
Take it from me, son. You are!

177
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,074
Okay, well are you gonna give me the chance
to wipe the floor with you at Trivial Pursuit or not?

178
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,548
Oh yeah, brill...

179
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:58,214
All right, yeah! Trivial Pursuits, eh?
Lovely Jubbly!

180
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,232
How d'you play it?

181
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:07,248
The thing is, Del Boy, it's all about general knowledge,
you know, it's a bit intellectual.

182
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,501
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:13,751
Some of the questions are, you know,
really difficult. It Could be a bit embarrassing.

184
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:16,586
Don't worry, I'll help you two out.
Alright?

185
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,961
- So... So what part of Africa did you go to?
- I bet he's been there!

186
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:29,914
- Well, the trip ended at Dar Es Salaam.
- I've been there.

187
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,448
Okay! Look, this is really boring.
We left Nairobi then went south to Moshi,

188
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:40,203
across the Serengeti to Musoma
then the long trek east to the coast.

189
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:42,091
During the war.

190
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:46,663
During the war we pursued a German battleship
down the eastern coast

191
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:52,079
and right the way through the Zanibar Channel.
Three days and nights we chased it.

192
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:55,610
- Did you catch it?
- Yeah, worse luck, it sunk us.

193
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:59,124
- We'll have to find that holiday brochure for Cassandra.
- Yeah, for sure.

194
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:07,002
Try and get your heads round this, okay?
Imagine the sun setting on the vast waters of Lake Victoria...

195
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:11,128
A hundred thousand wildebeest grazing
on the Masai Steppe, yeah?

196
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:13,595
Oh yeah, wonderful.

197
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:22,454
A misty, sleepy dawn rises to reveal
Kilimanjaro in all its hypnotic majesty.

198
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,929
Oh, it sounds great!

199
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,211
We're all going on a beano to Margate
next Saturday, Stephen. D'you fancy coming?

200
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,779
Me? Yeah it sounds great
but it's bank holiday weekend and

201
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,994
Joanne and I always spend them together.

202
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,627
No, I'm going away to Mummy
and Daddy's next Saturday, remember.

203
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,325
It's better than being on your own, Stephen.
It'll get you out of the old routine.

204
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,778
- No, I mean, I... I wouldn't know anyone.
- Course you will. Rodney's going.

205
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:52,411
You're going?

206
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,339
Yeah. Well, it's tradition.
You know, it's the Jolly Boys' Outing.

207
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:02,998
- The what?
- It's the Jolly Boys Outing.

208
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,876
We've been going on 'em for years.

209
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:10,260
Oh you can't stop Rodney from going, darling.
After all, it's only a day out. It'll do him good.

210
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,601
Yeah. Anyway, your Dad'll be there
to keep an eye on him, won't you?

211
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,055
You're off on a bloody beano?

212
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:20,985
Well, Del mentioned it. I thought...
you know, a bit of sea air, do me good.

213
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,696
You're going to get drunk, aren't you?
And make yourself ill on jellied eels.

214
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:28,808
I'm not gonna drink anything and I'm not gonna eat!
I'm just gonna - enjoy myself!

215
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,348
Well, who threw the highest number?
Was it me?

216
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,591
No, Del did.

217
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,492
Roll again, Derek,
and I'll ask the questions.

218
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:44,947
Alright, there we go. Four. What do I do now?
This me, yeah? That one. Look, one, two, three, four.

219
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,939
- Oh, S&N.
- S&N! What's S&N?

220
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:51,371
- Science and Nature.
- Oh right.

221
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:58,473
Oh God! It's so simple!

222
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:11,000
- 'What is a female swan called'?
- What is em... female swan called?

223
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,322
You don't know?

224
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:15,152
No no no no. I do, I do.

225
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:18,543
It's just that it's at the back of me braint here.

226
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:21,254
- Can you giss a clue.
- Three... three letters.

227
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,364
Oh come on now!
There's nothing in the rules about clues!

228
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,884
Ah, it's a female swan. Three letters.

229
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:34,092
Um, wait a minute, uh... got it.
It's a Bic!

230
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,792
Get out you noisy little git!

231
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:34,840
You miserable old sod! You're on a beano,
you're supposed to be enjoying yourself.

232
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:40,758
I haven't had my full quota of sleep, and I'm starving hungry.
Why'd we have to leave before breakfast?

233
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:44,406
Don't you read the papers, Albert?
The railways are on strike.

234
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:46,681
- So?
- And it's a bank holiday weekend.

235
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:50,738
Which means the roads are gonna be choc-a-bloc,
that's why we left early.

236
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,564
Now repeat that back to me,
I want to make sure you understand.

237
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,042
I'll give you a clump round
the ear in a minute.

238
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,262
Del, d'you reckon I could
get something to eat?

239
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:06,164
Yeah, 'course you can, Unc,
Denzil's in charge of the sandwiches.

240
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,501
Tell you what, you sit there, and I'll go an' get
some for you, alright?

241
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,665
Lazy old git!

242
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,788
You've gotta give Del his dues, ain't ya?
He did all the catering by himself.

243
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:22,706
Oh leave off, Jevon, can you see Del Boy
standing in a kitchen cutting up all them loaves?

244
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:27,491
- He probably got some idiot to do it for him.
- No, I made 'em for him.

245
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,792
Here y'are, want some bitter
to wash them down with?

246
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,484
Denzil, what's your game?
Don't your realise the damage that stuff does to you?

247
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,818
- They're antibiotics!
- What?

248
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:49,224
Antibiotics, the doctor prescribed 'em.

249
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,312
And I don't need that, I'm not supposed to drink
with 'em... I've got this infection.

250
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,934
- Oh have you?
- It's in the ear.

251
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,114
- How's it get there then?
- That's where you normally get ear infections.

252
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:08,078
Listen Del, you won't tell the others about this,
will you?

253
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:11,004
I mean, these days people
get the wrong idea about this sort of thing.

254
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,376
- Oh come on, don't be silly, Denzil. Course I won't.
- It's just an ear infection, that's all.

255
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:20,340
Oi, oi, oi, Denzil! You don't have to prove
yourself to me, do you? I'm your mate.

256
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,537
Cheers, Del.

257
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,769
That's alright. Oh by the way,
there's been a change in plan.

258
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:28,566
You're no longer in charge of the sandwiches.

259
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:33,318
Michael, your luck's changed.
You're in charge of the grub.

260
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,283
- Oi, I wanna word with you.
- Yeah? What is it, Sid?

261
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:41,442
- I own a cafe, right?
- Yeah, right, so what?

262
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:44,036
So, why didn't you ask me
to make the sandwiches?

263
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:48,595
Well, the explanation is simple.
We intend to eat them!

264
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,573
- Oh... alright, then.
- Right then.

265
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,791
Alright lads, only another ten minutes, then we'll be
at the halfway house, that's when the serious stuff begins.

266
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:08,143
Make those lagers long and cool.

267
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:13,378
Oh yes! Look out Margate,
and lock up your daughters. Hey?

268
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:21,459
- Alright, Alan?
- Yeah, I'm alright, son...

269
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,245
Salad... There's cheese for you Tone.
There you go Denzil.

270
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,221
Where is he?

271
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,970
You promised you wouldn't say anything!

272
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,581
Sorry, Denzil, it just sorta slipped out!

273
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:08,193
Hey Del. Here y'are mate.
It's the halfway house.

274
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:10,918
Ah! Hey! Lovely Jubbly!

275
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:44,679
- Oi! You seen Del Boy around?
- He was here just now. Why? What's up?

276
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,365
I think old Harry's had too much to drink,
he's fallen over twice.

277
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
Now he's tryin' to juggle with pickled eggs.

278
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,404
So what's that gotta do with Del?

279
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:57,235
Well, Del organised this outing
so it's his responsibility. I'll try the other bar.

280
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,438
- Sorry mate.
- Oi, Mike! It is you, innit?

281
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:06,656
I don't believe it! Eddie Chambers!
'Ere, I heard you'd emigrated.

282
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:11,974
That's right, yeah, I had a pub on the Isle of Wight.
So, you still in the trade?

283
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:14,386
Yeah, yeah, got a lovely
little place down in Peckham.

284
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,851
There's two of my satisfied
regulars over there.

285
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,316
You uh... around for a
while, then Eddie?

286
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:23,708
Yeah, 'bout another half hour.

287
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:27,629
Oh, I'll catch up with you. We'll have a right old chat.
I've gotta dash. A bit of business. See you later.

288
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:33,685
Panic over the slightest little thing these days.
Wouldn't have done in the war, Sid.

289
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:39,359
I wouldn't really know, Albert.
I spent most of my time in a German prisoner of war camp.

290
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:44,925
Got captured on this little island called Syros,
in the Dodecanese - just off the Greek coast.

291
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,280
No chance of escape from
there I suppose.

292
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:51,241
Well, a few of us tried it one night.
Got right down to the harbour,

293
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:55,870
overpowered some German sailors
and nicked their boat - fast bugger it was as well.

294
00:24:56,145 --> 00:25:03,185
We'd almost made it to the open sea
and this poxy Greek fishing trawler cut right across our path!

295
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:10,624
Got fished out by the Germans
and spent the rest of the war in a stalag.

296
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,774
- Fancy another one, Sid?
- Yeah, why not?

297
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:25,226
Oh there you are! Del.
Listen, we've got a bit of a problem out in the main bar.

298
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:29,034
- Why, what's happened now?
- 'Ere, gotta stop meeting like this, Michael!

299
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,785
Talk about a bad penny!

300
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,898
Del, I'd like you to meet an old mate of mine.
Eddie Chambers - Del Trotter.

301
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,535
- Nice to meet you, Del.
- And you, Eddie.

302
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:43,707
Eddie and I used to be rivals over in the East End,
we had pubs almost opposite each other.

303
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah, except mine was better than yours.

304
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:49,317
You must be joking! Del,
you know how I run a pub, don't you?

305
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah, that's right.
His must have been better than yours, Mike.

306
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,310
Oh thank you very much!

307
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,922
You still doing it then, Eddie?

308
00:25:55,957 --> 00:26:02,154
No, no, I got out the pub game years ago.
I own a club now in Margate - the Mardi Gras.

309
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,198
We do a decent meal,
we gotta resident cabaret,

310
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:11,073
you know, a singer, a magic act, a good comedian,
I mean... What more'd you want for a fiver?

311
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:16,406
Well that sounds fair enough to me, Eddie.
Here, we're on a beano to Margate as it happens.

312
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:18,484
Here, I tell you what, I just had an idea!

313
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:22,582
Why don't you give us some complimentary tickets,
like, you know - just to get the ball rolling

314
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:26,035
and we'll bring the rest of the coach party
down to your place to pay at the door?

315
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,705
We could pack your place out.

316
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,256
Yeah, I'll have some of that.

317
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,119
Tell you what, look. Two
for you, two for you Del.

318
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:33,938
There you are, you see, you
know it makes sense.

319
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,747
- Yeah. Maybe I'll see you later then mate.
- Yeah, see you later then Eddie.

320
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,029
- Yeah... good luck. Cheers Eddie.
- Thank you Mike.

321
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:44,182
What do we want complimentary tickets
for a night-club for, Del?

322
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,190
We've gotta be out of Margate by seven!

323
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:50,063
Oh look. Thank you very much.
Use your brains, will you Michael?

324
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:54,394
We might be able to flog 'em
to the holiday-makers, eh? Make ourselves a few bob.

325
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,419
- You know what I mean?
- Don't you ever stop?

326
00:26:56,454 --> 00:27:01,725
No. Yuppies never switch off, Michael.
It's all or nothing with us! Right, now, what's this problem?

327
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:04,117
I think you'd better come
and have look at old Harry.

328
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:18,033
Alright, Harry, you'll be alright, mate.
You'll be alright.

329
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:22,464
- Look at the state of him!
- And it's only eleven o'clock!

330
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,175
This is good news, innit?

331
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,047
It's no problem. You just chuck him on the back seat,
let him sleep it off.

332
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:32,559
Chuck him on the back seat?
He's the driver!

333
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:36,491
Oh bloody 'ell!

334
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,372
So what we gonna do now?

335
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:43,661
I don't know yet. I mean, there's bound
to be a way out of it. There's always a way.

336
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,494
Here, young Denzil's a long
distance lorry driver.

337
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:50,566
That's right, he could
handle that coach, no problem.

338
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:54,852
No, he's just got a Heavy Goods Licence.
To drive that coach he'd need a Public Service Licence.

339
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:58,035
He's got one of them an' all,
he used to drive on the buses with me years ago.

340
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,762
Well that's it then, innit,
eh? We're saved.

341
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:03,830
Oi, Denzil! Come over here.
This your lucky day.

342
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:06,055
- No!
- No? What d'you mean, 'no'?

343
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,027
I am not driving that coach!
I've been driving all week and this is my day off!

344
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:13,864
If you don't drive it we'll have to wait here
until Harry sobers up.

345
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,634
And by the look of him that
could take about a fortnight!

346
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,056
Well Sid used to be on the
buses, he can drive it.

347
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:21,395
I'd love to, Denzil, but
I've had a couple of drinks.

348
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,795
Yeah, so have I, you see.

349
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,566
No you haven't. You're not allowed to drink.
You're on antibiotics because of your disease.

350
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:31,024
I have not got a disease!
I have got an ear infection!

351
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,748
Get your left foot up, Harry.
Come on.

352
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,665
What d'you think's wrong
with him?

353
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,156
What do I think?
Well, snow-blindness would be my bet, Trig.

354
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:50,957
Yeah? I thought he was pissed.

355
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:03,858
Alright! Alright! I'll drive it on one condition –
Harry drives it home.

356
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:09,426
Good boy, Denzil, you know it makes sense.
That's it, good lad, Go on then, get on there.

357
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,082
Right, come on then you lot, come on.
Let's get on board. Hurry up!

358
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,916
Oi! You three! Get on the coach,
we're ready for the off now. Rodney, give me that ball.

359
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,118
Ruud Gullit - nowhere!

360
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,292
Excuse me sir.

361
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:31,354
'Ere, what happened? Hey?

362
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:35,843
- You! You’re under arrest!
- I couldn't help it!

363
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:37,269
Yeah, He's right, officer. He's right.

364
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:39,993
He just, you know,
he just 'threw' the ball back to me, like that.

365
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:46,215
I don't know how much you had to drink,
son, but it's too much! In the car!

366
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,176
No, I just 'threw' the
ball back at him!

367
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:51,887
You can tell me all about
it - at the station!

368
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,427
What's Cassandra gonna say
about this?

369
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,290
There's no need for Cassandra
to know anything about it.

370
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:06,215
And what happens when the
summons arrives?

371
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,870
Oh summons, what summons?
They're not proceeding with the case!

372
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:13,286
Del, that copper has just charged me
and taken a statement!

373
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,270
He's keeping the ball as Exhibit A!

374
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:18,608
He also reckoned the Chief Inspector
wouldn't take it any further.

375
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,411
They'll let you off with a warning!

376
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:21,921
Yeah, but say the don't?

377
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:25,079
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
I think you're in the clear, in fact I'm sure you are.

378
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,812
- Come on, let's get on the coach.
- Alright.

379
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:31,450
Come on, that's the spirit,
you know it makes sense.

380
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:35,076
Right, come on then Denzil.
Full ahead folks, we're off to Margate!

381
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:27,080
Well, the coach leaves in an hour.
Hasn't been a bad day though, has it?

382
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:33,164
No, it's been alright, bruv, it's been alright.
I've really enjoyed meself...

383
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:41,239
I'm feeling a bit cream-crackered now, though.
I think I might have a touch of that yuppy-flu, you know.

384
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:46,118
Yeah? Couldn't have something to do
with the lobster vindaloo and fourteen pina coladas, could it?

385
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,049
Well, it might have slowed me down a bit, yeah.

386
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:02,889
I went down the cemetery yesterday –
put some flowers on Mum's grave.

387
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,567
I ain't been down there lately, Del –

388
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,796
There's always something to do, you know.

389
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:12,389
No, no, it's alright Rodders. She understands.
She knows that you still think about her.

390
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:14,088
Yeah,'course I do.

391
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:18,608
Yeah, I just sat there, you know,
I was like chatting and that –

392
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,086
just letting her know what's been happening...

393
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,019
I bet she was well pleased. Yeah.

394
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,179
D'you know your Cassandra,
she reminds me a bit of Mum, you know.

395
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,398
Oh -good.

396
00:34:35,788 --> 00:34:39,593
She's got drive, ain't she? You know.
That's one thing Mum had a lot of drive.

397
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:47,501
- Yeah, Cassandra's very ambitious.
- That's good, innit?

398
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:56,038
Nothing gets in the way of her career,
no doubt about that.

399
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:59,556
- You must be well pleased.
- Yeah.

400
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:04,139
- 'cos she's and achiever!
- Yeah.

401
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:09,479
- Yeah, she's a bit like me in many ways.
- Yeah, I s'ppose so.

402
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:11,700
I've always been an achiever.

403
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,562
I've never actually achieved nothing mind you,
but I've always been in with a shout.

404
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:24,042
You know, this... this reminds me
of the time me and Jumbo Mills

405
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:30,106
set up a seafood stall outside the Nag's Head.
"Eels on Wheels' we called it.

406
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,652
We was gonna build empires, you know.

407
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:41,228
You know, every pub in London was gonna have
a seafood stall outside called Eels on Wheels...

408
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,212
D'you know what I said to him the night
that we came up with the scheme?

409
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,215
This time next year we'll
be millionaires.

410
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,271
I said, 'This time next year
we'll be millionaires'.

411
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,547
And we could have been, Rodney.
We could have been.

412
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:02,850
You know what killed off Eels on Wheels,
don't you? It was Television!

413
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,672
What, The Cook Report?

414
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:09,029
No, no, no. It was the television
started humanising fish.

415
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:10,690
What you going on about?

416
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:13,608
They did. They started to make fish human!

417
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:19,348
You know, first of all there was that shark thing,
Flipper - he had more GCE'S than you.

418
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,139
Then there was Squidly Diddly, the octopus,
he used to play the drums. There was Michael Fish!

419
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,423
And that put you out of business?

420
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,404
Yes, it's true, I'm telling you.

421
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,151
in case they was related to
The Man from Atlantis!

422
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:49,200
And that report from the council health inspector
didn't help none either.

423
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:59,038
I could have made it though, bruv!
I could have!

424
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:04,683
You will, Del, you will.

425
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:13,586
- Never stop believing, eh, Bruv?
- Never stop believing...

426
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:23,766
- Come on Andy, time to go home.
- Yeah.

427
00:37:44,785 --> 00:37:46,340
Are we all here now, Del?

428
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:50,635
No, we're just waiting for Rodney,
He's reporting in to headquarters.

429
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:54,700
Hi, Cass? It's me.

430
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:57,604
Roddy! I've been waiting
for your call all day.

431
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,125
Have you?

432
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,557
So how are you?

433
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:04,913
Oh, we're fine. Listen, we're at the coach park,
we'll be off in a couple of minutes.

434
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:18,573
'Ere, you won't tell my guv'nor what happened,
will you Del? I'd get the bullet if he found out about this.

435
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:21,817
Leave it out, Harry,
what sorta bloke d'you think I am?

436
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:27,048
I had one glass of lemonade in that pub!
I don't know what happened.

437
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:33,163
I felt strange - it was as if I'd been overcome
by fumes or something.

438
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,198
Yeah, well, whatever it was,
it's lucky we had Denzil about, weren't it, eh?

439
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,750
Don't I know it. He's a good
bloke, that Denzil.

440
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:45,270
Good bloke! He's one of the
best - one of the very best.

441
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:49,717
- Del!
- What does that dipstick want now?

442
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:51,917
There's smoke coming from
the radio.

443
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:54,147
Well you must have pressed
the wrong button or something.

444
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,050
Oh look, I'll come and sort it out.

445
00:38:58,115 --> 00:38:59,681
So how's your day been?

446
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:03,061
Oh, usual sort of thing.
Oh, Stephen phoned this morning.

447
00:39:04,204 --> 00:39:05,376
Did he?

448
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,271
Yeah. He'd found that holiday brochure
he'd been telling us about.

449
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,843
Mummy called round to see
if I'd like to have lunch with her,

450
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:15,054
then the Kent Police Constabulary
phoned to confirm that you lived at this address.

451
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,861
That was nice of them, wasn't it?

452
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:23,009
It's not s'pposed
to do that, is it?

453
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,568
Well, no, we it wasn't in
the brochure at least.

454
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:30,517
Oi! Boycie! Boycie, here!
Come here a minute.

455
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,320
Yes, What is it?

456
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:35,695
Look, you see, Dell said
'Give me the ball'.

457
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,928
Oh! I might have guessed
Del would be behind it somewhere!

458
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:41,095
No, he didn't mean to get
me into trouble!

459
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,687
Well, he never does, does he?

460
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:46,992
Yet it seems every time Del's around you
something goes wrong and you're at the sticky end of it!

461
00:39:47,257 --> 00:39:48,903
Not every time!

462
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,256
What're we supposed to do
about it?

463
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,686
Well, I'd switch it off if I was you, Del.
The main petrol line runs right underneath there.

464
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,099
Blimey!

465
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:03,812
- We gotta do something about this!
- Someone get some water.

466
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,634
Yes, good idea. Water, we
need loads of water.

467
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,497
Ain't this coach fitted
with a fire distinguisher?

468
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:12,246
Abandon ship! Come on, get off there.

469
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:16,500
...and what about that time he entered one of your
paintings in a competition and you won first prize?

470
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:22,626
- In the under-fifteen category!
- Yes, I do seem to recollect it. But I don't think he...

471
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:26,020
... and I had to spend a week
in Mallorca posing as your common-law step-mother!

472
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:29,089
Come on then everybody.
Hurry up. Look lively.

473
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:34,399
Alright, look, I agree that Del gets a bit out of hand,

474
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:38,165
but I think it's unfair to say
that everything he touches goes wrong!

475
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,251
Cass? You still there?

476
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,039
Our coach has just blown up!

477
00:40:57,517 --> 00:41:00,245
Don't worry, Harry,
I won't tell your guv'nor about it!

478
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:22,558
I don't believe it!
There's only a bloody train strike!

479
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:27,741
My son is being
christened in three weeks' time!

480
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,833
- What about my cafe?
- I've got a pub to run, Del!

481
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:32,273
- I was supposed to meet a bird at nine!
- And I lost my dolphin!

482
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:34,822
Well, just shut up?
I've just about had enough of the lot of you!

483
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,977
What about a Green Line?
There's a bus stop over there.

484
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:39,167
Yes. Good idea, Denzil!

485
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:52,667
There you are, look.
The next bus to London is at twenty hundred hours!

486
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:58,520
- What's that mean, Rodney?
- Eight o'clock. So wee got half hour wait.

487
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:00,916
Ah well, that's not too bad.

488
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,349
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's the normal schedule...

489
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:08,532
Look here... uh... Bank holidays, Christmas,
last bus goes at 19.20. We missed it by ten minutes.

490
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,185
- So when's the next one then?
- Ten past eight tomorrow morning.

491
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,954
Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful!

492
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,418
- We could hitch-hike.
- What, twenty-seven of us?

493
00:42:18,424 --> 00:42:22,311
- I remember once just after the war.
- Oh don't start, Unc!

494
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:24,999
We've had enough of your
stupid stories for one day. Albert!

495
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:28,524
Oi, oi, oi! Watch it! He's a war hero,
he's got a right to speak!

496
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,264
I fought for free speech!

497
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,331
Shuddup!

498
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:35,712
So why does he have to
keep saying such stupid things then?

499
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:39,239
Look, you keep on Mickey, and the back of my hand
is gonna have a quiet word with your ear'ole!

500
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:41,709
Oh that's it! Let's all have a punch-up
in the middle of the street –

501
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:44,104
that'd put the cherry on the cake,
wouldn't it?

502
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,626
And this is the last time
I come out on a beano with you!

503
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:49,490
And that's the last time I'm gonna invite you!
And I tell you another thing...

504
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:53,112
Look, calm down, calm down.
You'll get nowhere arguing.

505
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,424
Now, let's look at the facts.
What we got here is Hobson's Choice.

506
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:02,932
We can't get a train, the last bus has gone,
our own vehicle is somewhat out of action.

507
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:06,641
The coach company has promised to send down
a replacement vehicle - tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.

508
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:08,330
So there you have it, gentlemen.

509
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:10,166
So what you saying?

510
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:13,740
What I'm saying is, we're gonna have
to spend the night here.

511
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:16,212
We book into a hotel, a bed and breakfast –
it's only for one night.

512
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:19,568
You seem to be forgetting something.
This is a bank holiday.

513
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:24,218
This town is full to the rafters with holiday-makers.
Where are we gonna find a room?

514
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,327
There's bound to be a
couple of them still vacant.

515
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:29,304
Yes, but there's twenty-seven of us!

516
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:37,944
Er, me and Mickey are gonna
take a little walk on the sea front.

517
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,548
Yeah, well, we feel like...
you know, stretching our legs.

518
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:48,350
I quite fancy taking the night air.
How about you, Michael?

519
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,679
We've been down this road
once already, ain't we?

520
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:26,865
We've been every bloody where!
We've walked further than the Jarrow Marchers.

521
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,232
Yeah and they were all out of work and starving

522
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:33,334
and I bet they didn't moan
as much as you two! Gordon Bennett!

523
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,471
Here, hang about! Look at that!
I told you some-thing'd turn up, didn't I?

524
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:42,184
Look! Look, 'vacancies'. Hey?
Hey? Come on. Lovely jubbly!

525
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:47,736
- If you'd just like to wait here please.
- Oh right, thank you.

526
00:44:48,154 --> 00:44:49,544
Mrs Baker.

527
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:53,934
Smell that, Rodney. Can you smell that?
That's roast potatoes, innit?

528
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:55,872
Yeah, and gravy.

529
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:58,835
And steak and kidney pie
unless I'm mistaken.

530
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,000
We've fallen on our feet,
haven't we?

531
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,681
- And I am starving!
- I know, so am I.

532
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:07,060
Ain't he a beautiful cat, eh?
And he likes me.

533
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:09,668
Most probably in love
with that beard.

534
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,103
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

535
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:19,216
Look, we'd like a room for the night,
you know, you can chuck in an evening meal,

536
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:21,131
bit of brekkers, you know, that sort of thing.

537
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:25,337
Oh what a shame. I let the last of my rooms out
about an hour ago.

538
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:28,507
No, you got a sign in the
window saying 'Vacancies'.

539
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,723
Is the sign still there?
Oh that silly girl, I told her to take it down.

540
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,237
Excuse me please.

541
00:45:35,487 --> 00:45:39,466
Helen, you forgot to take
the sign out of the window.

542
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:43,213
Oh I'm sorry, Mrs Baker.
I'll just serve dinner then I'll see to it.

543
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,078
I am sorry, gentlemen.

544
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:52,447
- Couldn't we kip down in your front room?
- Yeah, or on the landing.

545
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:54,544
Yeah, or in the airing
cupboard, you know, anywhere.

546
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:57,635
I'd love to help but it's
the regulations, you see.

547
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,513
Well, is there anywhere round here
we can get a room for the night?

548
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:06,759
Well, it's difficult. It's a bank holiday weekend you see,
and this rail strike doesn't make things any better.

549
00:46:07,149 --> 00:46:11,372
- You could try... oh no, maybe not.
- No, please, where?

550
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:16,484
Well, you could try Mrs Creswell's.
She's at the Villa Bella just across the square.

551
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,195
She's always got vacancies.

552
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,760
Oh right. Well, thank you, we'll go
and knock her up then. Yes. Thanks very much.

553
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,479
And the next thing you know
- whoosh, up it went!

554
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:34,638
Did you see Del Boy's face?

555
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:37,215
Oh I wish I'd had my video
camera with me.

556
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,069
Oh, look who's here.
It's the Coachbusters!

557
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:45,601
- Are you staying here as well?
- No, no, we're... no we're not, no.

558
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,942
Oh that's a shame, 'cos
you would have liked it here.

559
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:49,426
Yeah, we've had a lovely
hot bath each.

560
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:50,646
Nice warm room.

561
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:53,819
And the food's great.
You would have really liked it here.

562
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,628
Yeah well, we don't care
'cos we got somewhere even better to go.

563
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:00,362
Yeah, yeah. That’s right, yeah.

564
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:03,022
'Ere, you're not going to
the Villa Bella are you?

565
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:05,730
Um... no, no, we're not, no, no...

566
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:11,808
No, no, we're no...
We're going down the... it's a secret!

567
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:17,009
Well that's a relief,
I was beginning to feel guilty 'cos it's so nice here.

568
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,935
How's your disease, Denzil?

569
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:27,995
I have not got a disease!
It's an ear infection!

570
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:30,877
Yeah. Mrs Baker, would you make sure
that he takes his tablets.

571
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:35,890
Only the doctors down at the clinic for iffy diseases
did say that it's not contagious.

572
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:38,506
Well, at least they said they hope it wasn't.

573
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:41,154
Bon appetite, gits!

574
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:48,677
Gertchyer!

575
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:58,812
Oh look! There it is, look. Villa Bella.

576
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:14,644
There you are,
don't look too bad.

577
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:21,605
Don't look too bad? Look at it!
It looks like the Munsters' weekend place!

578
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:25,658
Oh come on Del, let's find somewhere else.

579
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:30,086
Oh Rodney, where?
We've been everywhere in town, ain't we, eh?

580
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:35,195
And look at it, it's gonna start chucking it down again
in a minute and then we're gonna get soaked and frozen.

581
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:41,165
Now come on, this is our last chance.
You never know, it might be rather nice inside.

582
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,268
Well, I'm game!

583
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:47,347
There you are, that's the spirit, Uncle. See?
He who dares wins.

584
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:53,080
Hey, go on... go and ring the bell.
Go and ring the bell. Hurry up.

585
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:23,622
- Are you Mrs Creswell?
- Yes.

586
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,819
Oh! It's just that the lady down the road,
Mrs Baker.

587
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:30,613
She recommended us to you.
Said you might have a room for the night.

588
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,446
Come in.

589
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:55,083
- Are you Bella?
- No. Bella died ten years ago.

590
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:57,611
I hope they've buried her!

591
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:04,889
- It's cold, innit?
- That's the weather.

592
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:08,381
Oh is it? I do...
I don't know, I'm a stranger round here.

593
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:14,625
I've got a three-bedded room vacant.
It's ten pounds a night each

594
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,268
and that includes
a traditional English breakfast.

595
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:19,965
Oh well, that's uh... that sounds
just the ticket, Mrs Creswell.

596
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,941
That'll be thirty pounds in advance.
Sign the book.

597
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,609
Inga, show these gentlemen
up to the Blue Room.

598
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:31,262
Can't you see I'm serving dinner?
I've only got the one pair of hands!

599
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:33,521
Well, show them up after
you've served dinner!

600
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:36,219
You do everything your
bloody self round here!

601
00:50:39,684 --> 00:50:43,198
- I'm training her.
- She's coming on a bundle, ain't she?

602
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:50,162
The front door is locked at 11pm
and not opened again until 9am.

603
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,393
Mrs Creswell, thank you.

604
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,416
Come on, it's up here.

605
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:03,216
Would you ever come on?

606
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:29,664
- Move over a bit!
- You've got most of the bed!

607
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:32,803
You're pulling the covers off me!

608
00:51:33,439 --> 00:51:36,680
Leave it out you two!
You gonna carry on like this all night?

609
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:41,106
Tell him to stop pulling
the covers off me!

610
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:43,848
Rodney, stop pulling the
covers off Albert!

611
00:51:44,093 --> 00:51:46,507
Well, tell him to get
over to his own side of the bed.

612
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:48,851
Albert, will you get over to your own side...

613
00:51:50,695 --> 00:51:54,160
Well, this is like spending a long weekend
with Zippy and Bungle!

614
00:51:59,387 --> 00:52:02,177
God knows what Cassandra
would say if she was here!

615
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:07,981
Oh, she'd most probably say 'Roddy,
what's your uncle doing in bed with us?'

616
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,082
It's alright for you, Derek, this happens to be
my first night away from Cassandra for a whole year!

617
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:18,096
I bet she ain't half glad!

618
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,463
What's that supposed to mean?

619
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:26,109
Is this the way you carry
on when you're in bed with her?

620
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,625
Well, of course it's not!

621
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,034
So why are you giving me
all this aggro?

622
00:52:30,263 --> 00:52:36,598
Beca... because thee is a great deal of difference
between sleeping with Cassandra and kipping with you!

623
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:38,248
Like what?

624
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:45,234
Alright, like she smells nice!
Like, she wears...

625
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,979
... things!

626
00:52:47,014 --> 00:52:49,375
Woh back! Woh back!

627
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:54,125
And like she hasn't got a dopey
white beard thatkeeps tickling me!

628
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:58,363
See, you've woken somebody
up now!

629
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:07,129
Rodney, look, come on, it's only quarter past ten.
Let's whip down the old Mardi Gras, eh?

630
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:10,299
Have a couple of... a couple of jars, you know,
scampi supper, eh?

631
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:12,040
What d'you reckon? What d'you reckon?

632
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:18,341
No. Look. I promised Cassandra
I wouldn't go out and I intend to keep that promise.

633
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,617
You reckoned she believed you?

634
00:53:31,363 --> 00:53:33,596
When you said you wouldn't
go out on the town.

635
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:36,197
Well of course she believed me...

636
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:39,140
- Why?
- Nothing.

637
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:46,348
Uncle, you're not trying to suggest that if Cassandra
thought that Rodney was going out on the razzle

638
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:49,707
that she would go out on the razzle as well,
are you?

639
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:56,268
What, you mean what's good
for the goose is good for the gander?

640
00:53:56,488 --> 00:53:58,196
- Yeah.
- No.

641
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:03,345
Cassandra wouldn't have
gone out.

642
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:09,437
- How'd you know that?
- Because I haven't gone out.

643
00:54:09,472 --> 00:54:11,926
Yeah, but how does she
know that?

644
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:18,057
Beca... She just does, right?
Our marriage is based on trust.

645
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:23,449
Yeah, he's right.
Cassandra wouldn't go out enjoying herself.

646
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:24,654
Thank you.

647
00:54:24,689 --> 00:54:27,333
She wouldn't have to, she's
got that flat to herself.

648
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:31,658
So what?

649
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:39,593
No, hey, I... I just meant if she felt a bit 'lonely',
she could invite someone round.

650
00:54:39,628 --> 00:54:44,940
Yeah, like that couple at your anniversary,
Stephen and his wife.

651
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,379
So what's wrong with that?

652
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:49,749
Nothing. Nothing.
No, it'll be a bit of company for Cassandra.

653
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:52,413
She seemed to get on well
with that Stephen.

654
00:54:54,673 --> 00:55:01,110
Of course they get on well.
They work together at the bank, he's a colleague.

655
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:08,867
In fact he's more than a colleague, he's on top...
he's her immediate superior.

656
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:19,858
No, anyway,
she couldn't have invited them two round,

657
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:22,513
'cos Stephen's wife's gone away for the weekend,
d'you remember?

658
00:55:22,548 --> 00:55:24,590
Oh yeah.

659
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,170
If that Stephen's been round my flat
I'll kill him!

660
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:36,349
What put that idea in your head?

661
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:40,115
I don't know.
Something's been bugging me.

662
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,643
What? Oh! d'you wanna do?

663
00:55:41,678 --> 00:55:46,059
You wanna, you know,
pop out for a drink and sort of talk about it, hmm?

664
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:49,406
Yeah, it might make you
feel better Rodney.

665
00:55:50,077 --> 00:55:51,912
Yeah, well, I suppose I
could manage a...

666
00:55:53,305 --> 00:55:57,705
This is a conspiracy, innit?
You two are in league with each other, ain't ya!

667
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,084
You just want me to come to
the night-club with you.

668
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,665
And you want the bed to yourself.
Well it ain't gonna work!

669
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:08,257
I promised Cassandra
I would not go out and I am not going out! Alright?

670
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:12,947
Alright, alright, keep your hair on.
No, we was only geeing you up. We didn't mean any harm.

671
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:16,722
Alright. Well let's shut up about it
and get some sleep.

672
00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:25,087
Do with an extra blanket,
I'm freezing in here.

673
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,144
Yeah, it is a bit cold, innit?

674
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:31,325
Cold? You bits of kids
don't know the meaning of the word.

675
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:39,848
You should have been with me on the Russian convoys.
One night it was so cold the flame on my lighter froze.

676
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:45,400
Come on then, just one
quick light ale.

677
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:55,007
Where have I seen that bird
before?

678
00:56:57,922 --> 00:57:00,087
It's that sort, wossername?

679
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:02,351
The one you went out with
for a while, Del.

680
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,089
It's Raquel, the strippagram!

681
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:07,861
- No, it is not!
- It is, Del.

682
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:12,618
You look at the board:
The Great Ramondo and Raquel!

683
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:26,863
It is her!

684
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:57,658
Raquel!

685
00:57:59,107 --> 00:58:00,692
Del?

686
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,139
Alright?

687
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:12,592
Bloody clever that, innit eh?
Marvelous!

688
00:58:18,264 --> 00:58:20,607
So I got back to England about six months ago.

689
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:24,498
I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
I haven't got any family,

690
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:27,784
except a brother in Milton Keynes,
but we haven't spoken for years.

691
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:31,276
So I saw my agent
and she tied me in with Ray.

692
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:34,037
- Ray?
- The Great Ramondo.

693
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,197
He was working in a holiday camp
down in Devon,

694
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:42,005
his last assistant had walked out on him,
well, he's a bit of a pig.

695
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:45,377
Anyway, after that we got
a three-month contract here.

696
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,236
Oh, it's not much but it's a job,
it keeps a roof over my head.

697
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,698
I didn't mean to let you down,
you know.

698
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:59,990
I was on my way round to you
and I was unexpectedly arrested.

699
00:59:00,025 --> 00:59:02,916
I know, it's alright,
you've already explained.

700
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:06,675
Why didn't you write to me?

701
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:14,520
Write to you? I thought you'd dumped me!
I've got pride, Del!

702
00:59:15,878 --> 00:59:19,612
I've never written to the other blokes
who've dumped me and I wasn't starting with you!

703
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:23,559
D'you want another drink?

704
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:26,621
No, I'm back on stage in a little while.

705
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:36,577
It's been noone else. I mean, since we split up
I haven't - you know - I've not been interested.

706
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,732
No, no, nor me.

707
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:43,854
No, no, honest!

708
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:46,421
Yeah, alright, I believe you.

709
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:50,850
Anyway, what you gonna do...
when this contract's finished?

710
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:54,059
Oh, I'm leaving the act.
I can't stand Ray anymore.

711
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:59,851
He's got a temper, sometimes he frightens me.
Don't know where I'll go.

712
00:59:59,886 --> 01:00:02,391
Peckham's very nice this
time of year.

713
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,322
Is it?

714
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:07,136
I know a lovely little flat
you could stay at, an’ all.

715
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:12,780
Maybe I'll try Peckham
then. Thanks.

716
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:21,651
Raquel, would you give me
your autograph?

717
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:23,229
Get away!

718
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:24,995
No, I mean it, straight.
Honest.

719
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,711
I've never given an autograph before.

720
01:00:26,746 --> 01:00:28,888
Well look, it's easy.

721
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:35,669
All you got to do, look, is just write your name...
and your address

722
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,759
and your telephone number.

723
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,716
Alright? Get your pigeons
back alright?

724
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:56,976
Yes, I did! Raquel, I don't know what the hell
you were playing at on that stage,

725
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:58,761
but don't you ever let that happen again!

726
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,708
I'm sorry, Ray. I was distracted.

727
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:03,021
Professionals are not distracted, love!

728
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:06,028
You either get your act together
or you find somewhere else!

729
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:10,423
There's plenty more where you came from.
We're on in ten minutes!

730
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,467
Alright, Ray, I'm coming.

731
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,422
D'you want me to whack him for you?

732
01:01:14,457 --> 01:01:17,537
Del, please, please! Stay out of it?

733
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:21,561
My contract hasn't long to run
so all I want to do is keep him sweet.

734
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:25,930
Besides, he's right,
it was unprofessional of me.

735
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:30,922
I'll see you then.

736
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:34,268
Yeah. You've still got my
address, haven't you?

737
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:43,830
Yeah, well, you know, you can write to me or phone me,
you know, if you like. You won't forget, will you?

738
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:46,205
Oh, I'll never forget you, Del.

739
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:12,406
- The most beautiful sound I ever heard.
- Will you keep your noise down?

740
01:02:13,537 --> 01:02:15,311
People are tryin' to sleep!

741
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:19,764
She's lovely though, ain't she, Rodney?
Eh? She's lovely isn't she?

742
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:22,009
Yeah she's lovely, now shut up!

743
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:32,692
- It's locked!
- It's what?

744
01:02:32,727 --> 01:02:34,545
It's locked.

745
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,032
Oh, that's right, she said she locks it
at eleven! What time is it now?

746
01:02:39,074 --> 01:02:42,795
It's twenty to two.
I'll just have to ring the bell.

747
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:46,850
You can't ring the bell,
you'll get Mrs Creswell out of her coffin!

748
01:02:47,928 --> 01:02:52,467
Well what we gonna do then, eh?
We can't hang round here till the morning, can we?

749
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:57,097
Del, if you wake her up she'll sink her teeth
into our necks before you can say, 'wooden stake'!

750
01:02:57,564 --> 01:02:59,529
You're frightened of her, ain't you?

751
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:02,438
Yes!

752
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,387
Well, I’m not!

753
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:07,351
Well, you ring the bell!
I'm gonna hide behind the wall.

754
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:25,488
Alright, maybe there's
another way out of this.

755
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:39,826
- That's our room, innit? That one?
- Yeah, I think so.

756
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:41,434
Right!

757
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:50,541
Abandon ship!

758
01:03:55,213 --> 01:03:57,139
Throw something up at the
window.

759
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:58,826
Yeah, alright.

760
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:10,273
You wally, now look
what you've gone and done!

761
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:11,334
Me?

762
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:13,663
Yeah. You were the one that said
go on throw something up at the window!

763
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:17,321
I meant a little pebble,
you just chucked half a paving stone through it!

764
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,745
Mrs Creswell!
One of our windows has just been smashed!

765
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,651
I heard it! Phone the police, Inga.

766
01:04:23,004 --> 01:04:26,488
Oh, That's all I need, innit?
I'm gonna get nicked twice in one day!

767
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:31,153
Look alive, Rodney, look alive.
Just get out of here. Come on, let's get out, let's get out.

768
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,225
Hello?

769
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,308
Hello, Raquel? It's Del Boy.

770
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:50,535
Del? What d'you want?
It's two o'clock in the morning!

771
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,617
Yeah I know. I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,
but Rodney's been and got us into a bit of trouble.

772
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:56,994
I didn't get us into this!

773
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:59,655
Yeah you did! It was your
bright idea, weren't it, eh?

774
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,367
- You chucked the bloody thing!
- I know but you said...

775
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:06,677
Yeah, look, look, look,
look, wait! What's wrong?

776
01:05:06,712 --> 01:05:10,661
Oh, we've been locked out of our digs
and we've got nowhere to kip for the night.

777
01:05:10,696 --> 01:05:13,542
We was wondering
if you could put us up till the morning.

778
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,688
It's a bit awkward, Del.

779
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:21,849
Raquel. It's freezing out here!
We've just bumped into a brass monkey crying his eyes out.

780
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:24,782
Oh, alright then.

781
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:26,801
Push the door and come up.

782
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:28,762
Oh good girl. You know it makes sense.

783
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:51,089
Yeah, that's better.
Cor, it's 'taters out there.

784
01:05:51,124 --> 01:05:53,176
Oh, sorry about this, Raquel.

785
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:55,503
Oh, that's okay. So what happened?

786
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:59,172
Well, the old girl where we were staying,
she locks her doors at eleven.

787
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:02,271
Well, I mean, we didn't leave your nightclub
till gone one, did we?

788
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:05,961
Well, I'm afraid an armchair
and a settee is the best I can offer you.

789
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,719
No, no, that's... That's great.

790
01:06:11,662 --> 01:06:13,816
No, That's... that'll be lovely, Raquel.

791
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,059
Yeah. It's alright, look,
we'll be away first thing in the morning,

792
01:06:16,094 --> 01:06:18,713
'cos our new coach comes about nine o'clock.

793
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:22,708
Listen, sweetheart, you can't give us something
to warm the old cockles, can you?

794
01:06:23,094 --> 01:06:26,671
Yeah, ok. I'll make you a coffee.

795
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:30,213
Oh yeah. Cushty. Cushty.

796
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,185
She's a blinding bird,
ain't she, Rodney, eh?

797
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,214
What, Raquel? Yes. T'riffic, Del.

798
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:38,620
She's got a radiant smile,
have you noticed that?

799
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:40,793
- What, her radiant smile?
- Yeah.

800
01:06:41,217 --> 01:06:42,692
You can't miss it can you?

801
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:47,336
I mean when she walks in she...
well she lights up a room.

802
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:51,640
Yeah. Most of your birds
walk in and light up a fag.

803
01:06:56,643 --> 01:07:00,411
Yeah! Yeah, and she's as straight as a die,
you know, straight as a die.

804
01:07:00,446 --> 01:07:02,832
She don't mess around with other blokes,
you know.

805
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,736
What, you're saying Cassandra does?

806
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:08,256
No! No, course not.
No, I've got nothing against the girl!

807
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:12,037
That's alright then. 'Cos if I thought you...
Sorry.

808
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:14,884
You're a touchy little git sometimes, ain't you, eh?

809
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:21,335
All I was just saying was, that since Raquel met me
she hasn't been out with any other blokes.

810
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,014
Well she only met you two
hours ago!

811
01:07:25,149 --> 01:07:28,207
No, I don't mean this time!
I mean like the first time!

812
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:29,970
Oh, right.

813
01:07:30,765 --> 01:07:32,523
She has been true to me.

814
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:36,096
Raquel, what's all the noise?

815
01:07:37,196 --> 01:07:40,674
- The Great Ramondo?
- What you doing here?

816
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:42,187
What am I doing here?

817
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:45,490
We was locked out of our digs and Raquel said
we could spend the night here but we're gonna go soon!

818
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:47,579
Oh did she? Well, we'll see
about that!

819
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:51,808
Raquel. What's the idea of letting strangers
into the flat without even asking me?

820
01:07:51,843 --> 01:07:54,151
- I'm gonna kill him! Gonna kill him!
- No, stay calm, Derek!

821
01:07:55,034 --> 01:08:00,215
It's gonna take a bloody good surgeon
three or four hours to get his magic wand back!

822
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:03,888
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!
Now come on, calm down!

823
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:07,939
I wanna know what the hell
is going on here.

824
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:11,782
Sit down!

825
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:17,163
Now, look, there's probably
a perfectly simple explanation to this.

826
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,913
Like what?

827
01:08:19,676 --> 01:08:21,441
Well, how the hell should I
know?

828
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:26,109
There is a simple explanation, Rodney.
The Great Ramondo's a bleeding bully boy!

829
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,794
Raquel told me. He's got her trapped here.

830
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:32,979
If she don't play ball with him not only has
she lost her job but she's lost her home as well!

831
01:08:33,014 --> 01:08:36,527
That's blackmail and I don't like that sorta thing!
I'm gonna sort it out right now.

832
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:39,974
Oi, oi! You're not certain of anything!
Don't jump to conclusions.

833
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:45,329
Look, for all you know them two might be...
well, you know.

834
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:54,597
I don't know... look, just find out
what the situation is first, right?

835
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:58,737
Nice 'n' easy, Del? Right? Nice 'n' easy.

836
01:08:59,892 --> 01:09:02,147
Alright! Alright, Rodney.

837
01:09:02,182 --> 01:09:07,416
I'm just gonna go in there and just gonna ask
a few questions and, you know, like... and that's all.

838
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:09,911
And what happens if you
don’t like the answers?

839
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:18,690
Well, that's life, innit, eh?
Just I'll know where I stand then, won't I, eh?

840
01:09:19,715 --> 01:09:20,752
Alright.

841
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:33,060
Excuse me... I'm terribly sorry to bother you.
I just wondered if we could have a little chat?

842
01:09:33,095 --> 01:09:36,286
See if we could come to some sort of a...
an understanding.

843
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,895
That's the way, Del, nice 'n' easy.

844
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:49,867
Now do you understand what
I was trying to say, eh?

845
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,129
Why the hell did you do that?

846
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:53,906
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright Raquel.
It's alright.

847
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:58,894
You don't have to be frightened
of the Great Ramondo no more - Del Boy is here.

848
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:15,280
Right, Ramondo - or can I just call you Great, eh?
Do you understand what I've been subtly trying to indicate?

849
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:19,421
You are out, pal! Your lease has expired!

850
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:25,073
This is nature's little way of trying to tell you
to get your arse down the road apiece!

851
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:29,738
- Why don't you explain to him?
- He hasn't given me the chance!

852
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:32,413
You'd better warn him
I was in the Territorials!

853
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,212
I don't think that's gonna
cut a lot of ice with him, somehow.

854
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:37,307
Alright! There's your coat!

855
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:39,230
There's your case...

856
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:43,524
and there's the front door!

857
01:10:43,559 --> 01:10:45,496
Or would you prefer to
take the more direct route?

858
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:46,734
Can I just say something?

859
01:10:46,769 --> 01:10:48,496
Yes alright. You can say something.

860
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:51,361
You better make it quick and you better
make it polite - there is a lady present!

861
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:53,838
There is nothing going on
between Raquel and me!

862
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:57,811
Nothing going on between you two?
A fella and a bird sharing a flat, there's nothing going on!

863
01:10:57,846 --> 01:10:59,261
What d'you take me for?

864
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,938
Look, I assure you it's the truth!
You see...

865
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:07,020
Raquel is not my type!

866
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,789
What d'you mean she's not
your type?

867
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:12,208
You could do a lot worse
than that.

868
01:11:13,972 --> 01:11:16,822
This is Ray's room...

869
01:11:17,468 --> 01:11:21,899
This is my bedroom...
Do you see what Ray's saying?

870
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:27,163
If I was the last woman on God's earth
I still wouldn't be his type!

871
01:11:33,795 --> 01:11:35,982
Take your time, Del.

872
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:43,263
You see, it's purely a financial situation –
it's cheaper than us paying for separate flats.

873
01:11:44,974 --> 01:11:47,398
Oh! You mean you're...

874
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:51,028
Yes.

875
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:53,425
Well, why didn't you say?

876
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,334
It's not the sort of thing
one drops into an introduction.

877
01:11:56,732 --> 01:11:58,995
God - I'm terribly sorry!
What must you think of me?

878
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,094
No need, really. Over and
done with.

879
01:12:01,129 --> 01:12:03,639
Well you see I... I didn't know.

880
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:05,380
You didn't ask, did you?

881
01:12:05,415 --> 01:12:08,446
No, you see I thought that...
you see I thought... I mean I...

882
01:12:08,481 --> 01:12:10,968
you see... Is...
I... didn't I, Rodney?

883
01:12:11,003 --> 01:12:12,866
Yeah, yeah he did.

884
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:18,027
You see... ooh... oh dear, I do believe
I may have dropped your suitcase out of the window.

885
01:12:18,383 --> 01:12:21,655
I'll fetch it. I could do with the air.

886
01:12:23,022 --> 01:12:26,185
No, you see, I'm... you see I thought...

887
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:29,722
No, no, no, Del, you didn't think!
You never think!

888
01:12:29,757 --> 01:12:33,063
You don't look, you don't listen,
you don't notice any of the signs!

889
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,718
You just go at it like a mad bull!

890
01:12:36,444 --> 01:12:38,020
I only did it for you!

891
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:41,034
Well, if that's supposed to
make me feel better, it doesn't!

892
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:52,234
I might publish your diaries one day, Del.
I reckon that could be a winner.

893
01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:57,183
I don't believe you sometimes!
Why did you do that?

894
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:03,052
He Who Dares Wins,
I've always been the same!

895
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,856
Well, this time I reckon that
He Who Dared cocked it right up!

896
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,671
Thank you.

897
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:17,593
I know you did it for me
but you were stupid and you were embarrassing!

898
01:13:21,893 --> 01:13:23,700
Thank you.

899
01:13:27,998 --> 01:13:29,764
Magic!

900
01:13:40,972 --> 01:13:42,824
See you, Dave.

901
01:13:49,394 --> 01:13:53,406
Rodney! Here!
Oi, here a minute! Come here a minute!

902
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,297
Listen. You are master of your own flat.

903
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:01,007
Yeah, okay.

904
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:05,527
You're a man. Don't want
any rules, no collars and lead.

905
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:07,294
Alright, Del, alright!

906
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:10,559
You've gonna go in there,
put your foot down with a firm hand

907
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:13,402
and let her know where she stands. Right?

908
01:14:14,556 --> 01:14:20,440
You've just... You just gotta sort it out, alright?
Just, you know sort it out.

909
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:25,927
- Alright. I'll see you.
- Yeah, I'll see you then. Ta ta.

910
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,988
I didn't expect you
back this early.

911
01:14:50,338 --> 01:14:55,868
No... well, here I am.
Cass, can we have a talk?

912
01:14:55,903 --> 01:14:59,115
I don't think this is an appropriate time, Roddy.
Maybe later.

913
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,556
Look, I really think we
ought to sit down and discuss...

914
01:15:03,027 --> 01:15:05,941
Hi, buddy, how's it going?

915
01:15:07,491 --> 01:15:09,179
What are you doing here?

916
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:14,810
Oh, I was just passing.
So how was Margate?

917
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:17,773
Forget Margate!
What are you doing in my flat?

918
01:15:18,038 --> 01:15:23,687
Hey, back off, Rod!
I mean, what's the problem?

919
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:25,428
Roddy, what's wrong?

920
01:15:25,463 --> 01:15:27,844
Well, I'll tell you the problem, shall I?

921
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:31,515
There's something I've really wanted to do
for a long time but I've...

922
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:33,440
I've never got round to it!

923
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:38,501
So let me run this past you, Stephen.
Try and get your head round this.

924
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,226
Now you know where I'm coming from!
Okay? Buddy!

925
01:15:45,156 --> 01:15:46,820
Alright, Joanne?

926
01:15:49,973 --> 01:15:51,838
What have you done to Stephen?

927
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:54,192
He punched me on the nose!

928
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:58,775
Well, what's she doing here? I thought
she was going away for the weekend to her parents!

929
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,170
She was but there was a
rail strike!

930
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:04,323
Joanne brought this holiday
brochure round for us!

931
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:11,018
D'you see anything in it
you like?

932
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:22,756
Hello sweetheart? How are you today?
Oh good. How's the Great Ramondo...

933
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:24,794
Oh yeah...

934
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:29,993
Well, I'm sure in his heart of hearts he understood...
Oh, we've been back about an hour... Yeah.

935
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:36,988
Mm? No, everyone's alright.
We dropped Rodney off at his house, yeah...

936
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:43,943
Cassandra? No, she'll be alright,
she'll be as good as gold.

937
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:49,601
Rodney's a bit of a charmer on the quiet –
no, he knows how to handle situations...

938
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:55,593
Yes I know, sometimes I wish I was
a bit more like him and all...

939
01:16:57,339 --> 01:17:00,512
Old, Albert. He's feeling much better now,
yeah...

940
01:17:00,547 --> 01:17:04,182
Oh, didn't you hear?
He got a whack on the head.

941
01:17:05,474 --> 01:17:08,731
I dunno, I dunno. The strangest thing.

942
01:17:08,766 --> 01:17:17,527
He was lying in bed last night when all of a sudden
a rock came flying through the window,

943
01:17:19,326 --> 01:17:26,070
and it caught him a glancing blow on the head...
Dunno, it's a mystery!

944
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:31,729
It's no mystery to me!
Bloody yobbos done it! They should be locked up!

945
01:17:31,764 --> 01:17:33,927
That's right, Unc.
That is absolutely right, yeah.

946
01:17:33,962 --> 01:17:37,576
Tell her what happened to Boycie and Mike
when they was walking home from the nightclub.

947
01:17:37,867 --> 01:17:39,129
What? What was that?

948
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:42,084
Someone chucked a suitcase
through a window.

949
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:51,434
Caught Mike right on the shoulder –
fortunately Boycie's head broke its fall.

950
01:17:53,925 --> 01:17:56,488
It's a terrible old world, innit, eh sweetheart?

951
01:17:57,357 --> 01:18:01,958
Listen Raquel. Raquel, you have forgiven me now,
haven't you sweetheart?

952
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:04,751
Oh good. You know it makes sense.

953
01:18:06,209 --> 01:18:09,829
I was thinking
about taking the van out for a test drive next Saturday,

954
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:12,476
well I'm fitting a new radio, yeah.

955
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:17,871
I was thinking I might go down to Margate.
I wouldn't be in a hurry to get home...

956
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:22,616
I was just wondering if you could get
the Great Raymondo to do a disappearing act?

957
01:18:23,759 --> 01:18:31,756
Oh cushty! Yeah. Oh that's great.
Alright darling, I'll see you next Saturday sweetheart...

958
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,563
Yeah, alright. Bye for now. Bye.

959
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:37,436
Lovely Jubbly!

960
01:18:37,695 --> 01:18:42,392
Oi! What's your game? If you wanna cup of tea
go an' make one, you lazy old sod, go on.

961
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:51,182
Alright bruv? Sort it all out?

962
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:59,342
