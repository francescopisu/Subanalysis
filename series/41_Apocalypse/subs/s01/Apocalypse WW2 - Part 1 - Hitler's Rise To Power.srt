00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,840
HITLER'S RISE TO POWER

2
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,760
Berlin 1945, Europe has been freed
from the Nazi reign of terror.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,970
The Red Army is waging its final battles.

4
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,820
Captain Joseph Prautof, a Russian officer:

5
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,360
The hate ran so deep.
We wanted to end the war.

6
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,000
Annihilate that force that wanted to kill us.
Finish it off, once and for all.

7
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,440
Hitler's days are numbered.

8
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,570
He leaves his bunker
for one final bit of showmanship,

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,130
as seen in this propaganda film.

10
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,860
Is there still a soldier or a child,
willing to die for him?

11
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,040
The war left some 50 million dead.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,010
Most of them, innocent civilians.

13
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,180
For the women of Germany,
the ordeal would continue

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,080
even after the cannons had gone silent.

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,320
The book "A Woman in Berlin"
is a deeply disturbing account

16
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,590
of the Russians' rape
of German women in 1945.

17
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,400
They grab me and throw me down.
I'm lying with my head on the steps.

18
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,640
I see one of the soldiers keeping watch,
while the other rips off my under clothes.

19
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,880
And brutally forces himself on me.

20
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,920
But then we'd say, better to
have a Russian on your belly,

21
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,810
than an American over your head.

22
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,000
This German woman was referring
to the Allied bombers

23
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,390
that pounded her city into ruins.

24
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,510
The Kurfurstendam,
Berlin's most fashionable avenue.

25
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,080
13 years earlier, the showcase of Germany.
A nation still plagued by crises.

26
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,480
A monument commemorating the millions
of victims of the First World War.

27
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:33,640
Marlene Dietrich is singing "The Blue Angel"
in Berlin, Alexanderplatz.

28
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,800
Thomas Mann is savoring
his Noble Prize for Literature.

29
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,410
In the shade of the linden trees,
of Avenue Unter den Linden.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,780
Berlin is major cultural center of Europe.

31
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,620
One of the most open and tolerant cities
in the world.

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Then, in 1933, all that changes.

33
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,800
Through intimidation, demagoguery
and exploiting the bitterness

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,640
of the German veterans,
Hitler and his armed militias,

35
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,140
like the SA with their hymn,
the "Horst Wessel Lied",

36
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,540
seized control of Germany.

37
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,820
The Nazis take advantage of the fact
that the German Left is splinted.

38
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,930
And it even seems like Hitler
with his raised fist,

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,120
revolutionary salute,
wants to get on their good side.

40
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,570
German Communists take their orders
from Moscow,

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,840
which views the social democrats
as the true enemy.

42
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,940
No alliance is possible between them.

43
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,240
So, for the last time, German Communists
sing "De Internazionale".

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,590
Hitler comes to power legally
on January 30th, 1933.

45
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,000
Within a few months, his dictatorship
is firmly in place.

46
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,800
He becomes "Die Führer", the Leader.

47
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,720
His supporters rise and chant, "Heil Hitler!"

48
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,360
However, not all Germans are
totally convinced, so again and again,

49
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,190
Hitler hammers home his simplistic,
nationalist slogans:

50
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Before us lies Germany

51
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
Within us Germany is stirring

52
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,240
Behind us, all Germany is following!

53
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,770
And he eventually wins more
and more people over,

54
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,070
for he has a remarkable power
of persuasion over the masses.

55
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,150
But what does Hitler want?

56
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,240
In his book "Mein Kampf", My Struggle,
he clearly states what he calls his missions.

57
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,180
Being one of the embittered veterans
of the First World War,

58
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,250
his first mission will be to destroy France.

59
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,520
To wipe out the humiliation
of the Versaille Treaty of 1919

60
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,050
that stripped Germany of its army,
and part of its territory.

61
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,310
Then, he wants to conquer what he calls
"Lebensraum", living space.

62
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,810
Germany has a population of 80 million,
twice that of France.

63
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,820
He wants to make Germany
"The World Power" that it deserves to be.

64
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,320
A pathological anti-Semite,

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Hitler has also taken on
the mission of asserting the superiority

66
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,230
of the Germanic Aryan race,
menaced by the Jews.

67
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,400
For him, the Jews were
the cause of the Great War,

68
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,910
Germany's defeat, inflation, unemployment.

69
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,790
The next war will be a war on the Jews.

70
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,520
They will be sent to Dachau,
the first concentration camp

71
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,130
where Hitler locks up the anti-Nazis,
the communists, social-democrats,

72
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,330
and all those opposed to the Nazi regime.

73
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,820
Lastly, Hitler takes on the mission
of bringing all German speaking peoples

74
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,440
into the Reich's fold,
beginning with those of his homeland.

75
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,000
The Anschluss, Austria is annexed,

76
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,980
and immediately submitted to
the same reign of terror as Germany.

77
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,440
With the opening of one of
the most infamous concentration camps

78
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,420
at Mauthausen, near Linz.

79
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,930
Which country will be his next victim?

80
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,160
Neighboring Czechoslovakia, where there is
a German population, the Sudeten Germans.

81
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,160
But the country is recognized as
an independent state, by England and France.

82
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,670
The clouds of war gather.

83
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,840
In Munich, temple of Nazism,
an 11th hour peace conference is organized.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,050
On one side, Adolf Hitler who is becoming
more and more frightening.

85
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,050
And his ally, the Italian dictator,
Benito Mussolini.

86
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,000
Mussolini, the founder of fascism,
an indoctrination of an entire nation.

87
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
From childhood on.

88
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,760
On the other side, the Western democracies,
victorious but exhausted from the Great War.

89
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,420
Neville Chamberlain,
the conservative British Prime Minister.

90
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,520
And the radical socialist French Premier,
Edouard Daladier,

91
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,320
want to save the peace.

92
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,800
They end up accepting the unacceptable.

93
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,170
They give up the Czech province
of Sudetenland to Hitler,

94
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,590
in exchange for his solemn promise
to make no more claims

95
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,450
on another European territory.

96
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,530
But what is Hitler's promise worth?

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,720
Just six months later,
he invades the rest of Czechoslovakia.

98
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,690
And enters Prague, accompanied
by Marshall Hermann Göring.

99
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,760
Göring, a former First World War fighter pilot,

100
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,660
one of the founders of the Nazi party,
is now the Air Minister.

101
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,370
And an ogre, trying to charm
the Czech children.

102
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,770
Hitler no longer needs the excuse
of reuniting German speaking people.

103
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,540
The powerful Czech industry
will be working for him.

104
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,110
Why shouldn't he take advantage of it?

105
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,780
The Allies let him get away with it.

106
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,240
The USSR is the last major
neighboring power left to counter Hitler.

107
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,950
It had signed a mutual assistance treaty
with France.

108
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,200
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
is the official name of communist Russia

109
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,380
and its satellite republics.

110
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,960
Manipulation of the masses in Red Square,
masks the ironfisted dictatorship of Stalin

111
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:31,500
who has also thrown millions of poor
wretches into his labor camps, the Gulag.

112
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,200
Industrialization and forced militarization
have made the USSR a major power.

113
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,740
Despite their fear of communism,
the Western powers rely on the U.S.S.R.

114
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,060
Hitler is going to beat them to the punch.

115
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,930
In the summer of 1939,
in his Berchtesgarden chalet,

116
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,400
with his Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Joachim von Ribbentrop,

117
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,100
he prepares a blocking maneuver.

118
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,160
Hitler, who swore to destroy communism,
sends von Robbentrop, the Nazi, to Moscow

119
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,760
to sign a history-making treaty
with his worst enemy.

120
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,800
When Stalin's foreign affairs minister,
Molotov, signs the German-Soviet Pact,

121
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,860
communists are totally taken aback,
like these French Party Members.

122
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,880
It's August, 1939, and people in France
are enjoying their first paid holidays.

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,240
One of the major victories
of the Socialist Popular Front.

124
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,240
What are the reasons behind
this non-aggression pact.

125
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,520
The Soviets answer that Stalin
is playing for time.

126
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,520
Letting Hitler and the Western powers
kill each other off.

127
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,390
Perhaps, Stalin, who intends to grab
the Baltic countries and part of Poland

128
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,200
even has the illusion that he could share
Europe with Hitler on a permanent basis.

129
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,970
In 1936, the US Congress had passed
the Neutrality Act,

130
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,070
to avoid being dragged
into a European war once again.

131
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,350
So, with nothing to fear either from
the United States or from Russia,

132
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,880
Hitler decides to wipe out what he calls

133
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,880
"The worst monstrosity
of The Versaille Treaty", the Danzig Corridor.

134
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,400
In 1919, German territory was cut in two,
in order to give Poland access to the sea.

135
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,730
Hitler decides to launch his invasion
of Poland and recover Danzig

136
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,410
on September 1, 1939, at 5:35 AM.

137
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,880
The first cannon shot of
the Second World War, is fired on Danzig.

138
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,870
Hitler is convinced that the French
and the British will not take action.

139
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,240
Yet the two governments meet immediately,
and send him an ultimatum

140
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,280
demanding that he halt all military action
against Poland.

141
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,810
Hitler declares, "Our enemies are little worms."

142
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,160
And he adds, "Who wants to get bogged down
in a world war for Danzig?"

143
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,460
September 3, 1939

144
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,970
at 11 AM, The Ambassador of Great Britain
in Berlin delivers a declaration of war.

145
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,270
At 5 PM, France declares war on Germany.

146
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,580
Hitler can hardly believe it.

147
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:11,360
German generals find themselves facing
their worst case scenario: War on two fronts.

148
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,960
But the die is cast.

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hitler unleashes the Wehrmacht,The Armed
Forces of Nazi Germany, onto Poland.

150
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,160
Entering battle as if in a bygone age,
the Polish cavalry charges the German tanks,

151
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,650
and is slaughtered.

152
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,300
Paris, the Gare de l'Est train station.

153
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,960
Many of these men had shipped out from
these same platforms 25 years ago,

154
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,610
in a totally different atmosphere.

155
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,010
In August 1914, they marched off
to war in high spirits

156
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,380
with flowers in their rifles.

157
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,200
But there are no flowers this time.
And no rifles.

158
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,060
Nobody wants to fight this war.

159
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,500
4 million men are mobilized.

160
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,480
Many of them are farmers.
France is still a largely rural country.

161
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,720
They head for the German border on foot,
with their officers following on horseback.

162
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:50,480
Armies still rely heavily on horses and these
are requisitioned throughout the country.

163
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,760
Motorization has not kept up.

164
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,090
Gaston Chirac, a driver of one
of these outdated trucks,

165
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,480
with solid rubber tires, recalls:
There was such a shortage of equipment.

166
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,770
We had one rifle for two per truck.

167
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,410
We had one box of 10 bullets,
which we weren't allowed to open.

168
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,360
It was pathetic. If we'd had what
we needed, we'd have fought,
 
169
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,160
because we're no great friend
of the "Bosche".

170
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,280
The "Bosche" was a pejorative term for
the German soldiers during the previous war.

171
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,880
They were also called "vert-de-gris",
which in French means "field gray",

172
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,120
the color of their uniform, which enabled them
to blend in with their surroundings.

173
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,780
But just who are these soldiers?

174
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,950
Let's take for example, one of these
young Germans, marching as he sings:

175
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,950
Our flag is waving before us,
Our flag is a new age.

176
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,050
Our flag is stronger than death.

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,700
His name is August von Kageneck,
he writes:

178
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,800
I thought that a military career was the right
choice. My parents thought so as well.

179
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,700
My father would tell me:

180
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,080
At least there, you can still open
your mouth and say what you like.

181
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,480
And you don't have to do that Nazi salute.

182
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:30,720
In September 1939, August von Kageneck
is still training to become a tank commander.

183
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,560
He writes: My father who was a general
was telling me:

184
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,590
The French have 40 divisions on the border,
we have 15.

185
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,600
All the rest are in Poland.
500,000 men against 200,000.

186
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,990
They outnumber us 2 to 1.

187
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,480
French Forces attack on September 7, 1939,
4 days after declaring war.

188
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,400
This offensive launched to show public opinion
that Poland has not been abandoned,

189
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,220
advances 8 km into the Saar region.

190
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,080
The French army's cinema department
shows off the spoils of war, bicycles.

191
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,520
"...as we can see with these happy peddlers
who've recuperated

192
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,760
the bicycles that were abandoned in the
German villages."

193
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,980
The Saar offensive stops there,
and degenerates into a series of skirmishes,

194
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,590
raids by elite commandos,
led by the hero, Joseph Darnand,

195
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,160
who receives the citation of
"Premier Soldier of France".

196
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,870
Later, he will become one of the most rabid
collaborators with the Germans.

197
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,710
And eventually,
he'll be executed after the war.

198
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:09,080
The French army, in spite of its heroes and its
superiority in numbers, takes no further action.

199
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,850
General Maurice Gamelin, 67 years old,

200
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,190
is Commander-in-Chief of
the Allied-Franco British Land Forces.

201
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,330
For the French outnumber the British,

202
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,330
who also think that this war isn't for real,
and that it'll all be settled soon.

203
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,560
Gamelin himself has no desire
to re-fight the war of 1914.

204
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,950
He wants to avoid another bloodbath,
at any cost.

205
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,150
He considers that he needs 2 years
safe behind the Maginot Line,

206
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,020
in order to re-arm the country.

207
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,730
The Maginot line is the work of a former
Minister of War, Andre Maginot.

208
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,640
This complex of fortifications was meant
to stop the German enemy, once and for all.

209
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,210
It took nearly 10 years to construct,

210
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,360
and swallowed up 1,5 million cubic meters
of concrete, and 150,000 tons of steel.

211
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,180
All these gun turrets are linked together
by a labyrinth of tunnels, 100 km of them.

212
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:25,430
The line itself, stretched for 720 km,
from the Swiss to the Belgian borders.

213
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,660
The Maginot Line ends
at the foot of the Ardennes Forrest.

214
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,160
The French military command
thought that German tanks

215
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,540
could never cross this extremely rough terrain.

216
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,640
The French didn't extend
the line all the way to the sea,

217
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,280
because Belgium,
before declaring its neutrality,

218
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,800
was an ally of France, and opposed it.

219
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,410
This northern part of the front is manned
by a French army

220
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,750
and the British Expeditionary Forces.

221
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,720
Later reinforced by Canadians, and troops
from the far-flung British Empire.

222
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,720
In Britain a popular song of the day was
"The Washing on the Siegfried Line".

223
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,110
We're gonna to hang out the washing
on the Siegfried Line.

224
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,020
Have you any dirty washing, mother dear?

225
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,400
We're gonna hang out the washing
on the Siegfried Line.

226
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,120
'Cause the washing day is here.

227
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,360
The Siegfried line is the string of fortifications
constructed by Hitler, facing the Maginot Line.

228
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,880
The Germans don't attack,
they're still trying to avoid a second front.

229
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,510
The French, nevertheless,
take some precautions.

230
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,910
They evacuate the population
of Alsace and Lorraine

231
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,920
to the regions of Perigord and Charentes
in the southwest.

232
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,390
Strasbourg, a ghost town.

233
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,030
Abandoned by its population,
emptied of its soul.

234
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,390
Especially that of the synagogues.

235
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,320
On 25th of September,
Hitler orders the bombing of Warsaw.

236
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,490
The city is surrounded, but still holding out.

237
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,650
The Führer wants to strike terror into
the hearts and minds, not only of the Poles,

238
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,430
but of the French and British as well.

239
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,260
"This is what is in store for you."

240
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,010
The world is horrified.

241
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,520
In New York, the bombing of Warsaw
is up in lights in Time Square,

242
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,880
and on the front page of all the newspapers.

243
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,420
Franklin Roosevelt, the President
of The United States addresses the nation:

244
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,590
This nation will remain a neutral nation,

245
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:48,830
But I cannot ask that every American
remain neutral in thought as well.

246
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,200
Even a neutral has a right
to take account of facts.

247
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:02,400
Even a neutral cannot be asked
to close his mind, or to close his conscience.

248
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,520
The bombing of Warsaw shows how vulnerable
the cities are.

249
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,420
Paris sets about protecting its monuments

250
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,320
and hides its museum's masterpieces
out in the provinces.

251
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,500
The Champ de Mars, at the foot of
the Eiffel Tower, is dug full of bomb shelters.

252
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,300
And there are frequent air raid drills.

253
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,440
Gas masks are compulsory.

254
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,880
Poison gases were used in the First World War,
and now, everyone is afraid of them.

255
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,740
Even the horses.

256
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,630
Meanwhile, Poland, is being ruthlessly
carved up.

257
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:53,640
As previously agreed with Hitler, the Soviets
have invaded the eastern half of Poland.

258
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,090
Here, German and Soviet soldiers
are fraternizing,

259
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,130
an incongruent site, to say the least.

260
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,040
The Nazis hand out flyers that read:

261
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,830
The German Army salutes the Red Army
of workers and farmers

262
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,500
which it has always held in the highest respect.

263
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,180
The Polish Army surrenders to the Germans,
and in the east, to the Soviets.

264
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,920
Stalin then orders the execution
of 20,000 Polish prisoners.

265
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,270
He wants to eliminate the elite
of this country he intends to annex.

266
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,970
4,500 Polish officers are executed
with a bullet in the head,

267
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,010
in the Katyn forest, near Smolensk, in Russia.

268
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,440
2 years later, at the Kremlin, Stalin meets with
the head of the Polish Government in exile,

269
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,260
General Sikorski,
who delivers a list of missing Polish officers.

270
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,400
The Soviets deny any wrong-doing.

271
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,410
In 1992, the president of post-Soviet Russia,
Boris Yeltsin

272
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,840
will present the Polish president, Lech Walesa,
with the original order of execution,

273
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,650
signed by Stalin himself.

274
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,130
Stalin, by occupying half of Poland,

275
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,030
is in fact, playing into the hands of Hitler,
who needs a common border

276
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,560
with the USSR to facilitate his plans,
to invade Russia.

277
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,510
Hitler and Himmler, the head of the SS,
will now take care of Poland

278
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:04,280
by naming the Nazi, Hans Frank, Governor
General of the Occupied Polish Provinces,

279
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,920
who proclaims, "I have the power of life
and death over the Polish people."

280
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,760
After the war, he will be tried at Nuremberg
and hanged for crimes against humanity.

281
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,960
These gypsies, held in a pen, are filmed
by a German.

282
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,550
For the Nazis, they are "Non-persons".

283
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,220
The women will be forced
to undergo sterilization,

284
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,060
because they do not deserve to reproduce.

285
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,020
The Nazis declare "Open season" on gypsies.

286
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,750
Hundreds of thousands will be interned
in concentration camps.

287
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,260
The ordeal of the Jewish people, begins.

288
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,790
The Nazis now have 3 million Polish Jews
at their mercy.

289
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,350
Hitler is still uncertain about
what to do with them.

290
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,900
As long as the war is going well for him,
he considers deporting them to the east

291
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,340
or even shipping them to Madagascar.

292
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,810
It's only when the outcome of the war
becomes less certain

293
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,750
that Hitler and his accomplices unleash
a frenzy of hate and murder.

294
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,100
"The Final Solution".

295
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,830
For the time being,
the Jews have to be identified,

296
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,030
marked with a yellow star,
and herded into ghettos.

297
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,740
Some of which, are completely walled-off.

298
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,240
From the diary of one of these
unfortunate souls:

299
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,240
It's heart-rending to see the shameful scenes
of violence that take place before our eyes.

300
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,820
Women and the elderly, beaten right out
in the streets by petty thugs.

301
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,660
Tears come to my eyes.

302
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,080
All our powerlessness, all our isolation
is there to see right in the open

303
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,630
where not a single person takes our defense.
We are so weak.

304
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,980
All the major cities of Poland
will have their ghetto prisons

305
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,850
where German, Austrian, and Czech Jews
will also be interned.

306
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,590
The Jews here still feel confident
that perhaps someday,

307
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,360
they'll be able to return to their homes.

308
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,830
They don't know that they will die
of hunger and cold.

309
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,910
They don't know that the Shoah
is about to begin.

310
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,720
Inhabited by Jews
No Entrance

311
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,610
Warsaw is in ruins.

312
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,020
Hitler comes to be filmed
by a propaganda crew,

313
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,330
seen here traveling in
a car in the background.

314
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,160
These victorious German soldiers

315
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,720
march their goose step
to the sound of the grenadier's march.

316
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,490
But they weren't too efficient
during the Polish campaign.

317
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,880
Poor preparation, a lack of fighting spirit,
and even cases of indiscipline

318
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,290
are the points that the commander-in-chief,
general von Brauchitsch,

319
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,150
dares report to the Führer.

320
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,800
Hitler is furious, but he is immune to doubt

321
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,600
and orders the attack on the West
to be prepared.

322
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,540
An attack on the Netherlands,
Belgium, and France.

323
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,310
Some of his generals think its madness.

324
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,480
Some of them begin plotting
to overthrow the Führer.

325
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,650
This is a crucial moment, the course of history
lies in the balance.

326
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:36,050
November 8, 1939, Hitler narrowly escapes
an assassination attempt.

327
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,130
It seems as if he enjoys some kind of
divine protection.

328
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,000
When he attends the funeral for the victims,
he's no longer the same man.

329
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:51,960
His power over the army and
the German people has grown even stronger.

330
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,960
He tells his generals:
My decision is irrevocable.

331
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,520
I will attack France when the time is right.
I will be victorious, or die in the attempt.

332
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,690
Yet, Hitler is still uncertain about
attacking the West, for he also says:

333
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,640
War is like opening the door on a dark room.
You never know what will happen.

334
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,920
Eventually, he postpones the order to attack,
and goes back to his chalet in the Alps

335
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,470
to join his mistress, Eva Braun.

336
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,750
She shot this footage of Hitler's entourage

337
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,950
of the Reich's architect, Albert Speer,
who goes for long walks with Hitler.

338
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,240
Speer recalls: Hitler wanted
to re-christen Berlin, Germania.

339
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,770
We already had a mock-up of the future,
Adolf Hitler's Square

340
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:57,560
with a dome, inspired by St. Peter's in Rome,
but 17 times bigger.

341
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,080
I said to him, "My Führer, wouldn't that
make an ideal target for bombers?"

342
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,320
He answered:
Not at all. Göring has assured me that

343
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,820
no enemy aircraft will ever fly over the Reich.

344
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,320
From his barracks, the future German officer,
August von Kageneck, writes to his mother:

345
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,930
We are all eager to fight.
We are ready for battle.

346
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,130
His mother answers:

347
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,830
This war is a crime, and we are going
to have to pay for it.

348
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,210
The war then enters a new, bizarre phase.

349
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,320
The Germans call it the "Sitzkrieg",
"The sitting war".

350
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,190
The British call it the "Phoney war".

351
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,200
And for the French, it's the "Drole de Guerre",
"The funny war".

352
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,340
A long, strange waiting period,
especially hard on the women.

353
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,010
For them there's not only the anguish of war,

354
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,750
but also the survival of their families
to worry about.

355
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:30,560
As in the last war, the soldiers dig in
and try to make the best of things.

356
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,500
The French soldier, Gaston Chirac,
writes to his wife:

357
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,520
It's 30 degrees below zero, the bread is frozen.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

358
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,110
They gave us some straw,
and with that, we can sleep better.

359
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,040
The winter of 1939-1940 is indeed
one of the coldest of the century.

360
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:58,020
To make a bad situation worse, all the winters
of this war, will be brutally cold.

361
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,120
The commander-in-chief, General Gamelin,

362
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,040
is expecting the Germans to attack
through Belgium

363
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:43,040
and move towards Paris across
this open plain, like in 1914.

364
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,800
Gamelin plans to make his stand against
the Germans, on Belgian soil.

365
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,600
In France, Colonel de Gaulle, a tank officer,
who is beginning to make a name for himself

366
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,240
criticizes this strategy.

367
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,510
He calls it the "Maginot Line Mentality"

368
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,220
which consists in waiting for the other side
to make a move.

369
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,790
In his book "Towards a Professional Army"

370
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:13,190
he argues in favor of taking the offensive,
making massive use of tanks.

371
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,830
France is producing 300 tanks a month,

372
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,240
but they're being dispersed in all the sections
to back up the infantry.

373
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,100
French aviation has also fallen behind.

374
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,150
France ordered 4,000 planes
from the United States,

375
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,040
in spite of the ever growing isolationist trend
championed by Charles Lindbergh.

376
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,230
The hero who made the first
Trans-Atlantic solo flight

377
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,920
and now a leading proponent of
the "America First" movement.

378
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:55,270
If you believe in an independent destiny
for America.

379
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,170
If you believe that this country
should not enter the war in Europe.

380
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,150
We ask you to join
the America First Committee in its stand.

381
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,640
It's the isolationist voice of America

382
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,760
and of public personalities like Henry Ford,
the anti-Semitic car maker,

383
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:22,440
Or like Joseph Kennedy, America's ambassador
in London, who is anti-war.

384
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:28,640
Whereas his son, John, the future president,
Kennedy, supports European democracies.

385
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,070
Nazi sympathizers in America also
contribute to the impassioned climate

386
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,510
that reigns at the beginning of 1940.

387
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,960
In Europe, The British Union of Fascists
are also quite active

388
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,920
up to the moment they're banned.

389
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,560
Oswald Mosley, "The English Führer",

390
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,840
challenges the government,
right in the center of London.

391
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,460
He'll spend the next several years in prison.

392
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,840
Mosley's speeches urge people to get out
on the streets, and stop the war.

393
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,000
But Winston Churchill has taken the reins
of the British government.

394
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,160
Here, we see him with the French general
Gamelin, and Admiral Darlan

395
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,770
who were on an official visit to London.

396
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,880
A Franco-British Expeditionary Corps,
is formed to help Finland

397
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
which has been invaded by the Soviet Union.

398
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,780
France is preparing to send its elite soldiers,
The French Foreign Legion.

399
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,680
The Foreign Legion, for a century it has been
taking in the world's reprobates,

400
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,490
no matter what their past,
as long as it's not too "Shady".

401
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,400
Their headquarters, in Sidi Bel Abbes,
in Algeria

402
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,780
now signs up a good number
of Spanish Republicans,

403
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,800
having fled from their country,
after Franco's fascists' victory.

404
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,310
They're now eager to fight the Nazis,
who supported Franco.

405
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,580
They'll all make the long trip to France.

406
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,240
The Legionnaires embark at Brest, along with
the well equipped "Chasseurs Alpins".

407
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,770
A mountain corp, trained for action
in the snow.

408
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,270
But Finland and the Soviet Union
sign a peace treaty.

409
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,780
A few days later, Hitler launches an offensive
against Denmark and Norway.

410
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,810
The "Blitzkrieg", the Lightning War.

411
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,640
The Wehrmacht takes Oslo in 2 days.

412
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,400
Hitler is seeking to protect "The Iron Route".

413
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,000
Iron is indispensable to the German war effort,

414
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:12,600
and 50 percent of its Swedish iron ore
is shipped out of the Norwegian port of Narvik.

415
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,610
The Franco-British Expedition Recon
lands in the Fjord of Narvik.

416
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,020
After a month of fighting,
the Allies take Narvik.

417
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,030
The Iron Route is temporarily cut.

418
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,080
This victory is good for French morale
and adds credence to their motto:

419
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,370
We will win because we are the strongest.

420
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,640
But the expeditionary corps will have
to abandon Narvik,

421
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,480
and for the rest of the war, train load after
train load of Swedish iron ore

422
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,850
will feed the German war machine.

423
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,890
The French are brought back home,

424
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,940
for the Germans have just launched
their offensive in the West.

425
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:16,080
The 9th of May 1940, Hitler left Berlin
on his private train, code named "Amerika".

426
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,030
Heading west towards new headquarters
near the French border.

427
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,040
Hitler announces:
Gentlemen, the offensive has just begun.

428
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,480
His generals had submitted him
their battle plan during the winter.

429
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:42,600
It looks similar to that of 1914,
attack through Belgium.

430
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,390
But Hitler preferred
general von Manstein's idea.

431
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:52,080
Cutting straight through the Ardenne forest,
and swinging up and driving towards the sea,

432
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,100
encircling the allies
with a sickle cut movement.

433
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,940
But this sickle-cut movement is, in fact,
a huge gamble,

434
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,510
because the Allies could turn back
and counter attack.

435
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:10,240
However, Hitler is confident. He notes,
"The main thing is to have good weather."

436
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,590
Leftenant August von Kageneck claims,

437
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,860
"We are the Wehrmacht,
the armed forces of greater Germany.

438
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,370
Victory is certain."

439
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,390
For the German soldiers,
their homeland is in danger.

440
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,630
After all it was the French
who declared war on Germany.

441
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,840
The 10th of May, 1940, at dawn, German parachutists
make a jump over Holland.

442
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,760
Their mission is to capture the air fields
and bridges around Rotterdam.

443
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,650
At the same time, Hitler unleashes
his war machine on Belgium.

444
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,790
Hitler waits.

445
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,080
Will the Allies fall into the trap?
