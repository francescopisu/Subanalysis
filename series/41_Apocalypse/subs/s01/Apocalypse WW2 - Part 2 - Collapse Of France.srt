1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,400
May the 9th, 1940. A little French town,
with little French children.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,680
A town in the Ardennes, not far
from Germany which is at war with France.

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,120
But things have been quiet, until now.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,920
So the children continue to line
their clogs up neatly,

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,600
and their school teacher says:

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,800
Today we'll learn a nice song,
to bring peace back to us.

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,870
Round, round, round, go the puppets.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,080
This will be their last class.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,360
The 10th of May, 1940.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,880
COLLAPSE OF FRANCE

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,320
At 5:35 AM,
the Germans unleash their offensive.

12
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,340
German paratroopers 
are dropped into Holland.

13
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,880
They are the vanguard,
the first of 3 million invaders.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,120
The Wehrmacht marches into Belgium.

15
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,120
This is Hitler's decoy.

16
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,430
The Germans pretend they're going
to attack France through neutral Belgium.

17
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,430
As they did in 1914.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,200
The French General Gamelin,
commander-in-chief of The Allied Forces,

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,520
is confident, he has everything covered.

20
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,140
He find tuned his stretegy
during the "Phoney war".

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,560
Gamelin moves his best motorized divisions, 
the elite of the French Army, into Belgium

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,960
along with the entire
British Expeditionary Force.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,600
These are fighting soldiers with true grid.

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,930
They will stop the German advance
through Belgium.

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,210
But Hitler, in his headquarters, is gloating.
His decoy worked.

26
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,950
He exclaims, "I could weep for joy."

27
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,960
He instructs Field Marshall Göring,
who commands the air force,

28
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,040
not to bomb the French columns

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,860
to let them proceed 
deep into Belgian territory

30
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,800
and he attacks them from the rear.

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,960
His real offensive will be through
the Ardennes.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,040
According to a French high command:

33
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,100
No tank could ever get through those
densely forested hills.

34
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,160
But nothing stops them,
except their own traffic jams.

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,670
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands and Belgium,

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,770
people who own cars
are among the first to flee.

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,277
Everyone is suspected.

38
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,270
A so-called "Fifth column" is feared,
spies working for the Nazis.

39
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,770
The Germans continue
their diversionary tactics,

40
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,020
invading Belgium with
specially trained airborne forces.

41
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,430
The sappers belt out their song
from their campaign in Poland.

42
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,180
The girls will have to wait, comrades.
It's time to go, comrades.

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,810
On the 11th of May, at daybreak, they are dropped
into Belgium.

44
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,750
Their goal is to capture the linchpin
of the Belgian defense system.

45
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,390
Fort Eben-Emael, on the Albert Canal,
which is reputed to be impregnable.

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,340
An intrepid German soldier heaves himself
onto the top of a turret

47
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,738
with a load of explosives.

48
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,320
The conquerors stride through the ruins
of Fort Eben-Emael, the key to Belgium.

49
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,720
Images such as these, will force
the Wehrmacht's reputation of invincibility.

50
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,260
After the fort falls, people scramble
to catch the last trains to Paris.

51
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,310
In the French capital,
the Red Cross is swamped.

52
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,250
Belgian refugees are transferred
to cattle cars heading south.

53
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,880
As the German enters Liege,
panic grows and spreads.

54
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:16,600
Faced with such a force,
there are only 2 options: Obey or flee.

55
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,905
Many of the refugees are people
from the country side.

56
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,910
As in many times in history,
farmers have always been the last to flee.

57
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,770
Loath to abandon their crops
and their animals.

58
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,385
The great Belgian poet,
Emile Verhaeren wrote:

59
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,480
The people around here have nothing at all.

60
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,560
Nothing before them,
but the endlessness of the open road.

61
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,280
The people who work the fields,
the people around here,

62
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,870
have only endless misfortune.

63
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,400
The Germans unleash their aerial offensive.

64
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:45,040
Destroying strategic crossroads, airfields,
refineries, and fuel supplies.

65
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,530
Cities in northern and eastern France
are bombed.

66
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,790
The French are now facing the reality
of modern warfare.

67
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,260
In the Netherlands,
the port of Rotterdam is ablaze.

68
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,168
The result of a German terror bombing raid
like the one in Warsaw.

69
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,470
But these bombs were dropped
after the city has surrendered.

70
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
Another of Hitler's war crimes.

71
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,980
In London, the new prime minister
is Winston Churchill.

72
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,852
His first speech reveals
his determination to keep fighting

73
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,600
whatever the circumstances.

74
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,300
I will say, without a doubt

75
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,100
that the faith of Holland and Belgium

76
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,130
like that of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Austria,

77
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,200
will be decided, by the victory of
the British Empire and the French Republic.

78
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:04,864
But things have suddenly turned
very grim in France.

79
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,080
In just 3 days, the Germans have
swept through the Ardennes

80
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,290
and are advancing towards
the French defensive line on the Meuse River.

81
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,530
They are closing the net with
their "Pincer" movement.

82
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,400
Seeking to entrapped the Allied troops
amassed in Belgium.

83
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,330
The German infantry-men knock over
the French,

84
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,200
as if they came from a different world.

85
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,740
With their hand-grenades,

86
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,520
machine guns
and with their sleeves rolled up

87
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,590
they take the town in one day.

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,423
Sedan, the key to the Ardennes,

89
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,260
which was already terribly marked
by the French defeat in 1870.

90
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,870
But the real obstacle for the Germans
is the Meuse River.

91
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,600
On the night of the 13th of May,
they bring in beams to build bridges.

92
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,070
The French fight back.

93
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,450
But the Germans neutralize
the French artillery.

94
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
And the next morning
their sappers finished the bridge.

95
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Galvanized by the general Guderian,
a 52-year-old Prussian.

96
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,690
A great armored warfare strategist.

97
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,400
Using tanks to strike with force,
daring and speed.

98
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,480
The Blitzkrieg or Lightning War,
should not give the enemy time to react.

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,480
First, the tanks, followed by infantry,
and backed by aircraft, especially the Stukas.

100
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,280
The Stukas, dive bombers,
equipped with sirens.

101
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,820
Resisting the intense pressure of the descent,

102
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,490
their highly trained pilots release
their bombs at the last minute

103
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,860
with lethal precisions.

104
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,680
The French prime minister, Paul Reynaud,
telephoned Churchill in alarm:

105
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,480
We have been defeated,
we have lost the battle.

106
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,680
The French generals are at a loss.
They are unable to react to the situation.

107
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,320
With the Allied forces tied up in Belgium,

108
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,990
how can they stop the Germans
from advancing?

109
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,400
In Paris, the French authorities are trying to deal
with the increasing numbers of refugees.

110
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,610
People from Belgium and Northern France
are pouring in the city.

111
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,670
Schools, hospitals and barracks
are soon overflowing.

112
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,760
Information is sparse, rumors abound.
Has Gamelin committed suicide?

113
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,993
No.

114
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,020
The French high command has just realized
that the Germans are heading for the coast

115
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,120
and the allies have fallen into a trap.

116
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
A counter attack is ordered.

117
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,200
Allowing a certain colonel de Gaulle,
to distinguish himself

118
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,900
at the head of a tank brigade.

119
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,200
The French Army possesses more tanks

120
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,760
and they are of better quality
than the German panzers.

121
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,840
But without any reinforcements
or aerial support,

122
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,480
the French tanks become prey to the Stukas.

123
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,050
The French combatants put up a good fight,

124
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,720
but they wonder why the air force
isn't protecting them.

125
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,290
Poorly prepared and with fewer planes,

126
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,080
the French pilots are heavily outnumbered
by the Luftwaffe, but they fight courageously.

127
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,600
Dozens of German pilots are shot down
and taken prisoner.

128
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,360
Some of these pilots will be returned
to Germany when the armistice is signed

129
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,710
and will then join the battle against Britain.

130
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,240
The German tanks move swiftly
through the towns

131
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,960
and villages of northern France.

132
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,110
Valiantly, the French try to slow
the German advance.

133
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,980
The Germans crush
any pockets of resistance.

134
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,590
The Germans have reached
the English Channel.

135
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,200
Hitler's strategy of the sickle-cut has worked.

136
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,640
The British Expeditionary Force,
the Belgian army,

137
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,240
and the French armed forces are encircled.

138
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,584
The Belgian King surrenders,
along with his army.

139
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,040
The British Expeditionary Force
withdraws towards the coast,

140
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,820
leading to the final collapse
of the Allied armies.

141
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,830
In Paris, the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud
dismisses Gamelin

142
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,070
and finds a new savior,
general Weygand, 72 years old.

143
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,870
One of the artisans of the Allied victory
in 1918.

144
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,400
To bolster morale, Reynaud names
another World War 1 hero as Vice Premier.

145
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,080
84 years old Marechal Petain, who will soon
turn his back on Reynaud's policies.

146
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,560
Weygand has no choice.

147
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,790
He too is forced to order 
a full retreat towards Dunkirk.

148
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,692
Hitler lets them go.

149
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,920
A gesture of clemency towards Great Britain?
Is he still hoping for separate peace?

150
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Or has Göring assured him that his air force
is capable of preventing an evacuation?

151
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,980
400,000 men cram the beach,
helpless and in disarray.

152
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,160
They have one last chance to escape,
over the sea.

153
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,240
Churchill orders any vessel that can float
to go and get them.

154
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,660
On the outskirts of Dunkirk,

155
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,190
the French hold back the Germans,
suffering heavy losses.

156
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,100
Göring sends out the Luftwaffe's Stukas
and bombers.

157
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,280
218,000 British and 120,000 French troops
are successfully evacuated.

158
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,800
The British Army is saved but it's in tatters.

159
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,160
The French will be sent back to France
in a final attempt to defend their country.

160
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,090
The British are sent off
to re-equipment centers.

161
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,340
All of Great Britain hails Dunkirk
as an extraordinary feat.

162
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,030
Churchill, however, puts it into perspective.

163
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,610
With lucidity, he says,
"Wars are not won by evacuation."

164
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:27,920
Even so, in those first days of June 1940,
the "Dunkirk spirit" is born.

165
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,884
The ruthlessness of this war,
and the destructive power of the Nazi enemy,

166
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,020
are now apparent to the British.

167
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,440
Light-heartedness and humor give way
to frantic efforts, to mobilize the nation.

168
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,963
On the 4th of June, Churchill, who is also battling
the defeatists on his own side,

169
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
speaks out, his tone is unforgettable:

170
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,300
"We shall fight on the beaches,
on the landing grounds,

171
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,440
In the fields, in the streets and on the hills.
We shall never surrender."

172
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,356
On the 4th of June, the Germans take Dunkirk.

173
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,270
A fabulous bounty awaits them.

174
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,730
Lavishly filmed by
the Wehrmacht Propaganda Units.

175
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,210
The British have left behind almost
all of their equipment.

176
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,680
The soldiers of the Wehrmacht film themselves
in high spirits.

177
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,360
They find a French gramophone
with a famous record by Maurice Chevalier.

178
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,510
The offensive continues.

179
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
France collapses.

180
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,960
But Reynaud and de Gaulle,
who is under Secretary of State

181
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,930
for Defense and War,
want to continue fighting.

182
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,610
In Rome, the Italian dictator Mussolini,
"Il Duce"

183
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,360
has big news for his people.

184
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
A declaration of war

185
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,400
has just been delivered...

186
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,360
...to the ambassadors of
Great Britain and France.

187
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,190
Mussolini is hoping for his share of the spoils.

188
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,600
The Rhone Valley, Marseille, as well as 
the disarmament of Corsica and Tunisia.

189
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,200
The French say, "It's a stab in the back."

190
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,140
Mussolini's offensive is cut short
by the French's Alpine Division.

191
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,080
General Rommel's troops storm Normandy
and enter Loire.

192
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,720
Paris is declared an "Open city".

193
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,740
In other words,
it's turned over to the enemy without a fight,

194
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,610
in order to be spared
the fate of Warsaw or Rotterdam.

195
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,320
The government has moved to Bordeaux.
The Germans are approaching the city.

196
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,680
Rumors fly, they kill, they rape,
like the Prussians did in 1870.

197
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,955
The Parisians, abandoned by
their government, flee.

198
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,060
All of France takes to the road.

199
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,400
A cataclysm that will be come to be known 
by a biblical name, the Exodus.

200
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,900
Millions of French men and women
head towards the Loire, the last rampart.

201
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,140
But there is no rampart strong enough,
against the Stukas.

202
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,160
On the 14th of June, 1940, at daybreak,
the Germans march into Paris.

203
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,570
The Nazi emblem, the Swastika,
flies over Paris.

204
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,430
One of the first acts of the German occupiers 

205
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,120
is to seize all the records
of the abandoned ministries.

206
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,007
Lists of spies, of Jews, of Freemasons,

207
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,610
and even the original copy
of The Treaty of Versailles

208
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,150
that so humiliated Germany in 1919.

209
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,050
It is immediately sent off to Hitler.

210
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,520
The exodus has come to a halt.

211
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,580
The bridges over the Loire are blown.

212
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,540
The only hope now, is that the fighting stops.

213
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,040
Petain in Bordeaux,
also wants to put an end to things.

214
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,510
The Germans continue
their relentless advance southward.

215
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,810
Though once considered a formidable force,

216
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,520
the French army is now a shambles.

217
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,760
And yet to dispute up a better fight
that would stored, especially at the time.

218
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,620
In 1 month, 100,000 French soldiers die.

219
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,960
More than in the same period of time 
during World War 1.

220
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,130
The deadliest war until then.

221
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:14,160
1,850,000 soldiers are taken prisoner,
along with 36,000 officers and 176 generals.

222
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,720
Among the prisoners
there are many African soldiers

223
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,120
from the French Colonial Troops.

224
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,560
The Wehrmacht's amateur film makers
film them with a perverse sense of satisfaction.

225
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,570
Famished, these soldiers kill a goat.

226
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,360
German propaganda news reels insist
on showing repeated close-ups of their faces.

227
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,480
The official instructions are to portray
the degeneration of the French

228
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,900
who are forced to go to war
with their slaves from their colonies.

229
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,560
The original German commentary is revealing:

230
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,760
The Allies say they're fighting

231
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:28,120
to defend civilization

232
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,960
against our "medieval barbarity".

233
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
Just look at them, the guardians of culture!

234
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,924
3,000 African soldiers and officers
from the French army

235
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,360
will be shot and killed, after they're captured.

236
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:48,440
After 7 years of Nazi's indoctrination,
racism is rampant among the German soldiers.

237
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,440
3 dates will now be decisive
in determining France's fate.

238
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,000
On the 16th of June, 1940,
Reynaud is out-maneuvered 

239
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,640
by the Council of Minister in Bordeaux,
and he resigns.

240
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,960
As his successor, Philippe Petain,
is appointed to head the French government.

241
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,430
Place de la Bastille.

242
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,430
Those who've remained in Paris listen
to Marechal Petain.

243
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,000
The war hero at Verdun
announces that he is seeking an armistice.

244
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
I have asked our enemies

245
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,560
to cease all hostilities.

246
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,800
I have taken this decision,
painful to the heart of a soldier

247
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,000
because the military situation demands it.

248
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,320
The German radio translates this speech
announcing France's capitulation.

249
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,110
Some French people are able
to pick up the BBC.

250
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,080
General de Gaulle has arrived in London.

251
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,520
On the 18th of June, he denounces the armistice.

252
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,260
A few days later, he records a new speech.

253
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,880
We believe that the honor of France

254
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,560
lies in continuing the war alongside our allies.

255
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,343
Hitler receives a telegram of congratulations
from Moscow.

256
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,440
On June 22, 1940, Hitler arrives in Compiegne,
near Paris.

257
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,760
The setup he has ordered is designed
to humiliate the losers.

258
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,120
He is brought the same railway car that
was used for the signing of 1918 armistice

259
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,520
that sealed Germany's defeat.

260
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,360
His revenge is complete.

261
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,499
The French delegation is led
by General Huntziger.

262
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,420
An interpreter reads out a diatribe

263
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,100
accusing France of declaring war
without any reason.

264
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,860
Hitler does not utter a single word.
He stands up and leaves.

265
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:22,944
The French delegates have been informed
of the terms of the armistice.

266
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,213
One of its conditions is that France hand over

267
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,980
all the anti Nazi Germans
who have taken refuge in France.

268
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:35,400
Huntziger tries to negotiate.
The Germans refuse.

269
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,890
Huntziger calls the government in Bordeaux.

270
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,440
The German Secret Services
tape his conversation with Weygand.

271
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,960
- This is Huntzinger.
- Yes.

272
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,240
Well, it's done.

273
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,520
- It's done?
Yes, General...

274
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
I'd like to thank you
for the way you handled it.

275
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,120
- Yes Sir, well, you understand me, don't you?
Yes, yes, I do.

276
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,750
Afterwards, Hitler has the railway car
taken to Berlin.

277
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,920
In the final days of the Reich,
he will have the SS blow it up with dynamite.

278
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,680
Soon, the major symbols of France's victory
in World War 1 will be mocked.

279
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,771
Like here, in Verdun, where half a million
French soldiers were killed

280
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,740
to come to this, 20 years later.

281
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,040
Hitler jeers, as he visits his men
who've only just taken the Maginot line.

282
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,110
He is more solemn when he enters Strasbourg
and its cathedral.

283
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,110
Alsace and Lorraine are German once again,
as he promised they would be.

284
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,990
The spoils of the French campaign,
2,000 tanks, 5,000 cannons,

285
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,460
300,000 rifles,
4,000,000 rounds of ammunition.

286
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,440
At an army supply warehouse,
the Wehrmacht finds a stock of "Long johns"

287
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,180
meant for the French army.

288
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,420
Warm woolen garments which
will be stored away for future campaigns.

289
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:56,500
The spoils are the factories, the harbors,
all the riches of France.

290
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,730
It was the French who declared war,
as a consequence,

291
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:06,570
they will pay the equivalent
of $100,000,000 a day, in occupation costs.

292
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,120
General Huntziger goes to the Germany for
the first meeting of the commission charged

293
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,000
with applying the terms of the armistice.

294
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,000
To spare troops, Hitler decides to let France
retain partial sovereignty

295
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,600
under a government at his beck and call.

296
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,040
And with a limited army stripped
of heavy weapons, just to maintain order.

297
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
The country is split in two.

298
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,040
An occupied zone in north
and along the entire Atlantic coast,

299
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,780
providing access to all the harbors.

300
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,200
Italy controls the Mediterranean area
and occupies a narrow ribbon along the Alps.

301
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,960
The rest is called the "Free Zone"
with a new capital, Vichy.

302
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,630
This "Spa town" has been chosen
in part for its many hotels.

303
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,600
In early July, Marechal Petain moves
into them, along with the government ministries.

304
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,180
The atmosphere everywhere, is abysmal.

305
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,600
However, this Vichy government
continues to control a vast colonial empire.

306
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,370
And above all, a still a powerful navy.

307
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,840
Hitler's only request is that its ships
be disarmed and remain in their ports

308
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,380
for he is afraid it might join forces with Britain.

309
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,150
Churchill fears the opposite
that it will fall into German hands.

310
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,350
He orders the Royal Navy to neutralize it.

311
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,640
A British naval force
sails to one of France's biggest naval bases.

312
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,294
Mers-el-Kebir, in Algeria.

313
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,000
Churchill is taking no risks,
an ultimatum is dispatched.

314
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,670
Either join us, scutlle your own ships

315
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,140
or sail under escort for demilitarization
in the Caribbean.

316
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:20,157
The French reject all proposals.

317
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,110
The British open fire.

318
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,860
Two French battleships are heavily damaged
and one, De Bretagne, is sunk.

319
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:38,826
1.297 French sailors are killed.

320
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,560
Seeking to show his people, the world,
and above all, The United States

321
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,000
how determined he is,
Churchill strikes out at his former ally

322
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,070
whose fleet could've help the Germans
land on British shores.

323
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,800
Two days after the attack,

324
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,480
the Vichy Government breaks off
diplomatic relations with Britain.

325
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,520
All of Germany acclaims Hitler.

326
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,550
His lightning conquest of France
enthralls his generals.

327
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:19,600
He sees himself as the greatest war leader
of all time, on a par with Napoleon.

328
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,810
And like the Emperor,
no one dares to contradict him anymore.

329
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,550
The Germans occupy the Channel Islands,
Jersey and Guernsey.

330
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,400
Stepping stones towards the invasion 
of Great Britain.

331
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,440
The British get ready for a German invasion,
taking measures that might appear trivial.

332
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,680
Another urgent measure is to send the children
away to the countryside for safety.

333
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,180
Always a painful moment.

334
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,770
Their elder sisters, their mothers
and grandmothers join the war effort.

335
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,880
Every woman must defend her home
against the fearsome German paratroopers.

336
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,600
The men join up as
Local Defense Volunteers for the Home Guard.

337
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,660
Even veterans of the First World War.

338
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:02,800
The willing and able are mobilized,
while the army rescued at Dunkirk reforms.

339
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,180
America supplies rifles, machine guns,
and anti-aircraft cannons.

340
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,040
And everyone perfects their skills.

341
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,000
Churchill delivers a most inspired speech
to the British people.

342
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,080
The Battle of Britain is about to begin.
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty.

343
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:42,440
And so bear ourselves that if
the British Empire and its Commonwealth

344
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,710
last for a thousand years,
men will still say,

345
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,750
"This was their finest hour."

346
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,800
One of Churchill's main weapons
is the Royal Air Force.

347
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,370
Along with its remarkable aircraft,
the Spitfire with its Rolls-Royce engine.

348
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,300
One of the best fighter planes in the world.

349
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,050
Britain also excels in the field of electronics.

350
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,120
The British are the first to use radar
for the purpose of defense.

351
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,690
In the ops room,
radar is used for detecting planes

352
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,560
and guiding pilots towards the enemy.

353
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,840
The pilots from all over the British empire

354
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,480
are joined by airmen who have managed to flee
their countries under German occupation.

355
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:44,520
Or whose government are in exile in London,
Poles, Dutch, Czechs,

356
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,320
and the first of the free French forces
along with de Gaulle.

357
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,230
Many of the British pilots are Oxford
and Cambridge students.

358
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,270
One of them, Richard Hillary, later wrote:

359
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,200
We were known as the "Long-head boys".
We were disillusioned and spoiled.

360
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,320
The press refers to us as the lost generation.

361
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,244
Superficially, we were selfish and egocentric.

362
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,650
The war demanded no heroics,

363
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,450
but gave us the opportunity
to prove to ourselves and to the world

364
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,120
that undisciplined though we might be,
we were a match for Hitler's dogma-fed youth.

365
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,830
These German pilots have been trained
by the "Hitler-Jugend", the Hitler Youth,

366
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,330
with the idea of revenge.

367
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,911
They feel that they are invincible.

368
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,890
Their leader, Göring,
is a popular figure in the regime.

369
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,160
Göring, who is a man of luxury,
often stays at the Hotel Ritz in Paris.

370
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,860
And turns the Luxembourg Palace
into the Luftwaffe's headquarters.

371
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,530
He has promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe
could obliterate the Royal Air Force,

372
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,400
in days, take control of the air,

373
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,020
and enable the Wehrmacht
to invade Great Britain.

374
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,480
The Luftwaffe has at its disposal,
all of France's airfields,

375
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,420
their installations and their equipment.

376
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Its pilot are well-trained.

377
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,720
Like Adolf Galland, with his trademark cigar
who fought against the Republicans in Spain.

378
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,461
Or Werner Molders,
an ace from the battle of France.

379
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,200
He was one of the pilots shot down,

380
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,530
taken prisoner and then returned
to the Germans.

381
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,280
He is now part of aerial offensive
against Great Britain.

382
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,347
Taking off from these fields in occupied France,

383
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,450
the Germans will attack convoys
in the Channel,

384
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,420
harbors and airfields in southern England.

385
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,760
They will shoot down 500 British aircraft,
at a cost of 1,000 of their own.

386
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,510
The British pilots hold out,
giving everything they have.

387
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,320
Churchill proclaims:
Never in the field of human conflict,

388
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,500
was so much owed by so many to so few.

389
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,470
Hitler decides to postpone his plans
to invade Britain.

390
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,590
This is his first setback.

391
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,840
His tactics now rely more on
night-time bombings.

392
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,440
He says, "The British will surrender
when their cities have been destroyed."

393
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:09,922
German's bombers attack British cities
like Coventry and London.

394
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,600
This is the "Blitz", daily bombings.

395
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,830
As for the British people,
they hold up admirably.

396
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,670
They dig shelters in the gardens
of their cottages.

397
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,300
And in London,
they sleep in the underground stations,

398
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,939
and go to work the next day.

399
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,750
They never lose their confidence,
or sense of humor.

400
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,040
Churchill says to the French:

401
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Here in London,

402
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,240
which Herr Hitler says
he will reduce to ashes,

403
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,920
our people are bearing up unflinchingly.

404
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,900
Hitler is exasperated.
He will later call Churchill,

405
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,660
"A Jew-ridden, half American drunkard".

406
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,160
From now on, whenever he is thwarted,
he will vent his spite against the Jews.

407
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,810
On October the 12th, 1940,
on the Day of Yom Kippur,

408
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,480
the Jews of Warsaw are told
that a ghetto will be set up.

409
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,400
A wall three meters-high is erected,
enclosing half a million of Jews.

410
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,690
Men and women, children, the elderly.

411
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:32,175
Who will suffer horrifically from hunger,
cold, and poverty.

412
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,920
In his chalet in the Bavarian Alps, the Berghof, 
Hitler is filmed by his mistress, Eva Braun 

413
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,950
as he celebrates New Year,
surrounded by children of Nazi dignitaries.

414
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,520
He has another plan up his sleeve,
another big gamble.

415
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,840
His mission now is to conquer
new "Lebensraum", living space to the east.

416
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:37,880
He has allied himself with Stalin,
only to better attack him later on.

417
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,000
His failure to take Britain compels him
to move quickly

418
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:48,520
before Churchill is able to draw America in.
That would set the world ablaze.
