1
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Something in particular?

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,400
- Funeral.
- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,900
No, funeral, you know?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,100
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,600
Yeah.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,600
That's a popular one.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,300
- Who was it that passed, a relation?
- No, we worked together.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,300
- I see. A professional relationship.
- Yeah, professional.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,200
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,300
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,300
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,700
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,100
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
- Pink?
- Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,200
No, he wasn't all that.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,800
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,400
True that. How did your boy fall?

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Hung himself.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,100
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,900
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,100
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,100
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,300
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,000
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,300
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,900
Hell, yeah.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,900
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,300
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,200
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Like what?

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,700
"Rest in peace, " "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,900
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just...

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,700
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
All right. Thanks.

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
- You cloned a what?
- A computer.

40
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,000
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

41
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,200
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

42
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,200
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

43
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,900
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,100
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

47
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,300
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,200
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

49
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,900
- Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
- Yeah.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,500
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

51
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,400
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,600
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,200
I don't know.

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
What's next?

55
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,400
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,900
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

58
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,400
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,700
How are they gonna think that?

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

61
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,000
It ain't.

62
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,800
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

63
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,600
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

64
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,000
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

65
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,400
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

66
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,300
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,700
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Hey, Frog.

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,900
Come here.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,300
No, seriously. Come here.

71
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,500
without hurting you deeply...

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,800
first of all, you happen to be white.

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

75
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,200
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

76
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,700
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Second, I'm also white.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,100
Not hang-on-the-corner -
don't-give-a-fuck white...

79
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,700
but Locust-Point-I.B.S.-Local-47 white.

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,100
I don't work without no fucking contract...

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,300
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,300
like my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

84
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,200
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

85
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

86
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
you can work my package.

87
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,300
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

88
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

89
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,600
All right.

90
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,300
- Keep it real.
- Whatever.

92
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
- Everything to your satisfaction?
- Yeah, you on it.

93
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,900
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

94
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,300
Seems so.

95
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,900
My cousin always works clean.

96
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,700
None of my business, I know...

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,700
but did your man Avon even know about it?

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're on your own here?

99
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,400
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

100
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,600
And if I were you...

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,400
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

102
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,200
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

103
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,200
All y'all.

104
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,000
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

105
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,000
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

106
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,500
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

107
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Man, fuck him.

108
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,100
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

109
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,200
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
He knew that.

111
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

112
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,500
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,700
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

114
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I tried to bring him up, bring him along --

115
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,200
- You were real good to him.
- I was.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

117
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,900
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,500
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

119
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,500
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

120
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm just saying...

121
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,100
it might've been for the best, you know?

122
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,300
His name is Head. Dick Head.

123
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,500
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
- Nice.
- Nice, right?

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
- Fellows.
- We need a bug.

126
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,800
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

127
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,000
of the modern urban crime environment.

128
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,700
Let me show you.

129
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

130
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,800
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

131
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,500
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

132
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,300
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

133
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
- How much?
- $1,500.

134
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,800
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,100
- You in?
- Am I in?

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Can we give it a test run?

138
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,100
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

139
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

140
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,300
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

141
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
- Let me consult my partner.
- Of course.

142
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
You got a credit card?

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,700
- Don't you?
- It's maxed to the max, man.

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,700
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,500
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

146
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,400
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

147
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,500
I gave your man some room, that's all.

148
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,400
You gave him a home.

149
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
- No.
- Yes.

151
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,100
You could take these 14 homicides...

152
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,900
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

153
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,500
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

154
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,200
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

155
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,700
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

156
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
It's win-win for me.

157
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,200
- No.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

158
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,800
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

159
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

160
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,900
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,500
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Sorry, Colonel.

163
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,700
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

164
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Smarter than he looks.

165
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
- Where's your friend?
- Who's that?

166
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,200
- The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
- Case is done, for all I know.

167
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,700
Yeah?

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,900
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

169
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,900
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
- So you back to the usual then?
- Yeah, the usual.

171
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,100
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

172
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,300
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

173
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,500
Fairfield?

174
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,700
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

175
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
Because of terrorism, I guess.

176
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,000
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

177
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,600
You need to be uptown here with us.

178
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
You got stripes in the Southeast...

179
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,200
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

180
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Man, I've never seen that thing.

181
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
- Snug.
- As a bug.

182
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
In a rug.

183
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,400
Let's go.

184
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,700
- This shit is hypnotic.
- Boring, too.

185
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
You make a show of it?

186
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,900
Is that the Valparaiso?

188
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,400
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

189
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,900
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
- Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
- Nothing's wasted.

191
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,900
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,900
- So when they lose a can --
- I see it go.

193
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,000
Gentlemen. Ladies.

194
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,200
The future is now.

195
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,500
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

196
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,500
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

197
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,300
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

198
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

199
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,200
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

200
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,800
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

201
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,300
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

203
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

204
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,000
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

205
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

206
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

207
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

208
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,800
It's like you in a store working the register...

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,100
and at the end of the day,
the shit just add up.

210
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,300
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,900
and I want to have the package
right for once.

212
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,700
Hey, Carver.

213
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

214
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,900
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,300
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

216
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,500
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part --

217
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,500
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

218
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,800
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

219
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,700
leaving Singapore a distant second.

220
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

221
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,100
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

222
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,800
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

223
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,800
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

224
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
- That's right.
- That's efficiency, Nat.

225
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,700
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

226
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

227
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,200
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

228
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,900
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

229
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Question? Yes?

230
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,100
The GPS readings, are they exact...

231
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,700
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

232
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

233
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Coming.

234
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,900
- Hey, Jackie.
- String. You, too?

235
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

236
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
How's Brianna? Is she back there?

237
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
What's up, little man?

238
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,300
How you holding up?

239
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Bri.

240
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
- Nicky boy, you get days this week?
- No.

241
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

242
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,900
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

243
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,400
It's all there, cuz.

244
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,000
- What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
- Nothing.

245
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,000
What did Frog say?

246
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,000
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

247
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
The packages were my thing, Nick.

248
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

249
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,700
Zig, we're making money.

250
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,900
It's your move, Nicky.

251
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,900
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

252
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,800
Paternity?

253
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,700
Priscilla Katlow.

254
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

255
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,200
I only fucked her once.

256
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,900
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

257
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,600
How do you know it's yours?

258
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
You call this lawyer?

259
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,100
Figured I'd get drunk first.

260
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,400
That's a good plan.

261
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,300
- Russians?
- Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

262
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,600
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

263
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,300
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

264
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
You got the club people, I guess.

265
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,600
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

266
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,200
She looks a little bit older.

267
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

268
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
She looks about 40.

269
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,100
Grab any ass, Prez?

270
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,100
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

271
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
- I have.
- For us?

272
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,600
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

273
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,400
But once Burrell reached out --

274
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,300
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

275
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,600
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

276
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,200
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

277
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,600
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

278
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,500
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

279
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,100
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

280
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,100
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

281
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,300
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

282
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,400
If I'm looking out for number one...

283
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

284
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,300
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

285
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,500
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

286
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,300
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

287
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,700
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

288
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,900
but now, you're asking too much.

289
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,400
One more year, Nat.

290
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,700
- Not for me, for the fucking union.
- The election's been scheduled.

291
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,200
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

292
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,900
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

293
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

294
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,900
It's our turn, Frank.

295
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

296
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,900
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

297
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

298
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,900
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

299
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,600
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

300
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

301
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Think about it.

302
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,400
- Hello?
- Brucie, baby.

303
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,200
- Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
- You talk to the presiding officers yet?

304
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,000
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

305
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,700
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

306
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,100
- When did you get served with these?
- I got them in the mail this morning.

307
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,700
- In the mail?
- Yeah, this morning.

308
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,600
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

309
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,500
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

310
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,900
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

311
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,200
- Who are you calling?
- The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

312
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,900
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

313
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,200
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

314
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,700
- He got you, Zig.
- Who got me?

315
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,100
Maui?

316
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,000
Love child, never meant to be

317
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,600
Love child, born in poverty

318
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,800
Love child, never meant to be

319
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,100
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

320
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,700
I just don't have the authorization.

321
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,200
Okay.

322
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

323
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,200
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

324
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Sorry. Wrong building.

325
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Sixth floor, all of them.

326
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

327
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

328
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,200
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

329
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,400
- So we're on.
- We're gonna need help with surveillance.

330
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,600
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

331
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,400
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

332
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

333
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

334
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
the happier he'll feel.

335
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,200
New truck?

336
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

337
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
- Hell, yeah.
- For real.

338
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,800
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

339
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,900
- You got more for me?
- I got if you got for me, right?

340
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,500
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

341
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Fuck!

342
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,400
I'm with you on this, man...

343
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,900
All right, dawg.

344
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,300
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

345
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,300
Keep it fucking moving.

346
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
Jesus Christ!

347
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,000
No!

348
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,700
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

349
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,100
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

350
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

351
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,400
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

352
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,600
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

353
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,400
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

354
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

355
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

356
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,900
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

357
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

358
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,000
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

359
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,800
- Nothing's alive in these, right?
- If they don't go hot to a truck...

360
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,900
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

361
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,300
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

362
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,200
- How you hanging?
- Good. I'm good.

363
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
You ain't been working much.

364
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,100
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

365
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Jesus on the main line

366
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,800
Tell him what you want

367
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh, Jesus on the main line

368
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Tell him what you want

369
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,800
Jesus on the main line

370
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Tell him what you want

371
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,900
Call him up and tell him what you want

372
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
If you want salvation

373
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,900
Tell him what you want

374
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, if you want salvation

375
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,200
Tell him what you want

376
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,600
If you want salvation

377
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Tell him what you want

378
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Call him up and tell him what you want

379
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Oh, call him up, call him up

380
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,300
Tell him what you want

381
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Oh, call him up, call him up

382
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,600
Tell him what you want

383
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,100
Call him up, call him up

384
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,100
Tell him what you want

385
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,300
Jesus on the main line

386
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,900
You did the 221?

387
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,300
Shit look tight.

388
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,900
Sorry for the loss.

389
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
You all sent him off right, though.

390
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
As good a homecoming as I been to.

391
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,100
- You been to your share, man, I know.
- No doubt.

392
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,300
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

393
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,300
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

394
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,800
- Got a proposition here.
- Go ahead to the car, man.

395
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,300
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

396
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,100
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

397
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,100
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

398
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,700
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

399
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

400
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,000
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

401
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,800
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

402
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,700
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

403
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,800
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

404
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,600
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

405
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,800
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

406
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,300
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

407
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,700
- You connected?
- This shit is straight off the damn boat.

408
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,500
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

409
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

410
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,900
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

411
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
so you see where this thing needs to go.

412
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,400
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

413
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,100
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean --

414
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,400
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

415
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,300
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

416
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
Later for all that bullshit.

417
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,400
- I'll talk to Avon.
- You do that.

418
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

419
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

420
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
- But the grain pier is still in there.
- And the rest is just talk?

421
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,600
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

422
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,300
Talk is your fucking job description.

423
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,000
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

424
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,700
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

425
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,300
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

426
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
- Jason's at Princeton.
- Princeton.

427
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

428
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
- Whatever he wants.
- Right.

429
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,300
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

430
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,400
You know, back when we were kids...

431
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,600
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

432
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

433
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
- Tang?
- Just invented.

434
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,000
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

435
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,400
- You drink it...
- You could be an astronaut, too.

436
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,000
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

437
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,600
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

438
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,000
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

439
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,600
What do you think they grew up to be?

440
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,000
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

441
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

442
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,100
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

443
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
You're out of line, Frank.

444
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

445
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,400
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

446
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,100
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

447
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

448
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,600
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

449
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,400
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

450
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,300
You're talking history, right?

451
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,700
I'm talking now.

452
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,900
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

453
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

454
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,700
But after the horror movie I've seen today...
Robots!

455
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,800
Piers full of robots!

456
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,700
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

457
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,000
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

458
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,700
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

459
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,500
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

460
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

461
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

462
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,100
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

463
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,500
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

464
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,500
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

465
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,800
and we get some ships in here.

466
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,200
Bring it down!

467
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,500
- Got one that disappeared.
- Get the container number?

468
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,600
- 11-37 to 12-14.
- Go ahead, Lester.

469
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,700
- We got one, you prepared to copy?
- Send it.

470
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,000
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

471
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,300
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

472
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,400
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

473
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,100
- 11-99.
- 11-99.

474
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,900
We got a live one. Be up.

475
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,600
- What am I looking for?
- Stand by on that.

476
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,000
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

477
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,600
blue overalls.

478
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,200
He's hooking the truck onto the...
What do you call it?

479
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,600
Copy that. What next?

480
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,200
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

481
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,900
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

482
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,700
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

483
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,400
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

484
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
11-37 to 12-14.

485
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,300
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

486
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,600
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

487
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,800
Copy.

488
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,000
12-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

489
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,000
- 11-37 to 11-99.
- 99.

490
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,000
Target's coming at you, you see it?

491
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,300
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

492
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,600
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

493
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,000
- Target approaching your 20.
- 11-34, copy that.

494
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

495
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,700
- He's all yours, Bunk.
- Copy.

496
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,400
- 11-34, you got the eyeball.
- Copy.

497
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,700
- 11-34.
- Go ahead, 34.

498
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,700
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

499
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,900
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

500
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,100
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

501
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,000
Pyramid Inc. 5605 Newkirk.

502
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,700
Copy that.

503
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,200
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

504
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,300
Avon, you knew he was using?

505
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,700
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

506
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
I mean, he came up off that shit...

507
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,900
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought...

508
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,000
Fuck.

509
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,000
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

510
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah, everybody showed.

511
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,300
- How did Brianna do?
- Rough.

512
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,000
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

513
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,100
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

514
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,300
- You know what I mean?
- What are the prison people saying?

515
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,900
That he just hung himself like that?

516
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,700
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

517
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,300
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

518
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,300
What are you gonna do?

519
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,900
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

520
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,700
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

521
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,000
It ain't on you.

522
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,600
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

523
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,900
What's up with that other thing, man?

524
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

525
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,700
- We gonna discount it.
- Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

526
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,900
- I'm saying, I mean --
- What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

527
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,200
Re-package it and sell it off.

528
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,600
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

529
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,500
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

530
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,300
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

531
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,500
- You know, it's a thought --
- It's not even a thought, man. No.

532
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,300
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

533
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
- I know.
- All of it.

534
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,800
Anything come out?

535
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,100
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

536
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,700
- Your DNRs go where?
- Phones for dockworkers local.

537
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,900
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

538
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,700
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

539
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,700
On February 4th, and March 16th...

540
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,300
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cellphone.

541
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

542
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,100
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

543
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,400
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

544
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,200
- Conspiracy to do what?
- Smuggle shit.

545
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,900
Smuggle what?

546
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,400
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

547
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,400
- That one we know about.
- You need to do better for a wiretap.

548
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,400
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

549
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,900
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

550
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

551
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,000
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

552
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,400
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

553
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,900
That's the law.

554
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,500
Honey, I'm home.

555
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,300
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

556
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,800
- We can pay.
- How?

557
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
- Got a new job.
- Off the docks?

558
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,100
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

559
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,200
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

560
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,000
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

561
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,600
How much, Nick?

562
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
Come here.

563
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,000
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

564
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,300
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

565
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,700
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

566
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,800
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

567
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,500
for some place nice out in the county.

568
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,800
$1,500.

569
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,600
$1,250, with the police discount.

570
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,700
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

571
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,300
All right, slow up. This is it.

572
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,700
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

573
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,000
- Sobotka?
- That's what it says here.

574
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
That mean anything to you?

575
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,800
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

576
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,400
Frank Sobotka.

577
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,600
But we got Nicholas.

578
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,000
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

579
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,400
- You know what this means?
- What?

580
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,200
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

581
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,800
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

582
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,900
- No fucking way.
- Are you out $1,250?

583
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,800
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

584
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,200
has to be worth $200 for starters.

585
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,800
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

586
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,100
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

587
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,100
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

588
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,200
- Me?
- We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

589
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,600
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

590
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,300
And Daniels listens when you talk.

591
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,300
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

592
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,700
- We all got roles to play.
- What's your role?

593
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

594
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,100
You give yourself too much credit.

595
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

596
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
I'll be goddamned.

597
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,600
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

598
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,600
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

599
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,300
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

600
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,000
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

601
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,900
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

602
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
You think I can take him?

603
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,500
You can take him.

604
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,500
- Man down, berth five.
- Who?

605
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,000
New Charles.

606
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,700
- Ambo's on the way.
- Jesus Christ.

607
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,200
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

608
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,100
- You guys gonna move this thing or what?
- Jesus. Fuck.

609
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,100
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

610
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,400
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

611
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,700
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

612
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,400
One, two, three.

613
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,000
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

614
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,700
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

615
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,000
Right over there.

616
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,300
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

617
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,300
Frank, how does the leg look?

618
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,400
- Which leg is that now?
- Sir, can you hear my voice?

619
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,400
Squeeze my hand.

620
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,700
Let's get him into the ambulance.

621
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,300
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

622
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,100
- And you followed the can?
- Right to the warehouse.

623
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,300
- Surveillance set up?
- Kima is on it tonight.

624
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,900
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

625
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,400
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

626
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,900
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

627
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,800
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

628
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,400
Rawls came to me.

629
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,300
- Asked if I would take the homicides.
- You should.

630
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,300
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

631
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,800
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

632
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,800
But you let it pass...

633
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,600
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

634
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,900
From the guys in 15-14.

635
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,700
He should be all right.

636
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,600
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

637
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,200
First day of work was the same day...

638
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,600
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

639
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,600
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

640
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,200
Ever since then, New Charles.

641
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,600
He's gonna lose the leg.

642
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,600
Where's the money from?

643
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,700
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

644
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,400
No bullshit, no arguments.

645
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,400
No arguments.

646
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,400
- You're wasting all the batteries.
- So?

647
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,000
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

648
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,800
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

649
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,400
- Snitch.
- Punk.

650
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,400
- Squirrel.
- Mope.

651
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,000
- Shut up.
- Who teaches them this stuff?

652
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,200
It's my turn, you just had it.

653
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,900
Elena.

654
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,900
No.

655
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,600
I don't trust you.

656
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,900
I can care about you...

657
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,300
and I can want us to be friends...

658
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,400
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

659
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

660
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,100
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

661
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,500
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

662
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,700
It's a big, hairy one.

663
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
- Oh, my gosh.
- Come on, Mom.

664
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,200
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

665
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,600
It could still work for me.

666
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,900
Listen to yourself.

667
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,600
I love the job, Marla.

668
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,400
- I can't help it.
- The job doesn't love you.

669
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,700
You know what I love?

670
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,100
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

671
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

672
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,500
That's what I fell in love with first.

673
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,800
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

674
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,100
Your ambition.

675
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,700
Where did that man go?
