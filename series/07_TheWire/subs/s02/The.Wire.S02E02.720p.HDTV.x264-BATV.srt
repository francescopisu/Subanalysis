1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Thirteen bodies, all female...

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,900
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,100
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,900
From Eastern Europe probably.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
So this is, what, an accident?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,700
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,100
So, yeah, accidental probably.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
But that's his call, right?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,200
- Doctor.
- Frazier.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,900
How're we doing here?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,700
- How are we doing?
- I mean, what are we doing?

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,200
What's the plan with all this?

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,500
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,500
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
You got 13 for the price of one.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,400
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,700
What identification?

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,900
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,300
Who's the investigating agency?

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,800
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean Immigration.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,800
- But they're dead, so they're cargo.
- Cargo, but no contraband.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,400
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,400
- Yeah.
- That's a state thing.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
We'll eat it.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,600
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Good enough for me, brother.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,900
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,100
No crime, no investigation.

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,300
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,400
And then there was one.

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
- You don't have to do this.
- No?

37
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,100
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

38
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
You called him a Greek asshole?

39
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
You think we wanted this?

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,100
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,800
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

42
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,500
- This was a mistake.
- A mistake?

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
They fucking died in that can...

44
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,100
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
You know nothing.

46
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,900
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

49
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,600
you know, no Customs.

50
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,300
- He did not come off the boat.
- Why the fuck not?

51
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

53
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
I understand how you feel...

55
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,000
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Nobody here wanted this.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,100
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

59
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,500
in the stacks like I did, right?

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

64
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,200
Guns, okay?

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,500
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,500
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

67
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,800
- Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
- Boom.

68
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

69
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,000
But you don't ask...

70
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,900
because you don't want to know.

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,000
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

73
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Give him a couple of days, you know?

74
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
So Roberto been caught?

75
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

76
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Now the shit makes some sense.

77
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,200
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

78
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

79
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

81
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,200
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

82
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,000
- They saying you only got seven years, so --
- So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

83
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,400
They ain't saying they think it.

84
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,300
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
- So we on the outside.
- Yep.

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Look...

87
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,200
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

88
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,500
A friend in Atlanta...

90
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,100
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

91
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,200
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

92
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,800
You seen D'Angelo lately?

93
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,600
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

94
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,100
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,900
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
- I don't know what's what anymore.
- Now, what's up with Donette?

97
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

98
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,000
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

99
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,400
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

100
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

101
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

102
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,100
After all he has done for us...

103
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,600
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

104
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
- Promises were made.
- I know.

105
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,000
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

106
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

107
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,700
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

108
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,300
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Adjustments?

110
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,600
Brianna...

111
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,800
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

112
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,000
- You got these off the boat?
- What, in winter?

113
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,900
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

115
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
every now and again.

117
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,400
- Need some air in here.
- Leave it.

118
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,900
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

120
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
- You're the special kind of asshole.
- I'm special, all right.

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,800
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

122
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
took that girl over the county line?

123
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
- Three hours.
- Three hours...

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,900
with your little harbor maps...

125
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,300
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

126
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

127
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,800
- That's collateral damage.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

129
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,100
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

130
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,500
- We need Omar, Jimmy.
- You see this.

131
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,200
- Thirteen girls?
- Yeah, I heard about it.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
- Who caught it?
- It ain't ours.

133
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

134
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

136
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,200
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

137
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,700
It's time you show Bunk the love.

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
- You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
- Shit.

139
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,900
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

141
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Can you fucking believe that?

142
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,500
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

143
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
Who got to it?

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,100
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,700
- What was it?
- Vodka, I think.

146
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

147
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,800
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

148
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,100
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

149
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,600
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

151
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,600
- A couple of cases?
- Yeah, it was four.

152
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,200
- What the fuck is up with the police?
- What?

153
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,200
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

154
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,200
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

155
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
You got the tow bar set high.

156
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,600
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

157
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,600
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

158
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,800
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

159
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,100
- It ain't me, it's my boss.
- Who's your boss?

160
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,400
- Valchek, Southeast district.
- Stan Valchek?

161
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
The district commander, yeah.

162
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,900
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,900
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

165
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

166
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
- You work for a gaping asshole.
- More than one actually.

167
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,600
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

168
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,200
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

169
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,500
It's chain of command.

170
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

171
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,100
- You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
- You talk when I say you can.

172
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,500
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

173
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,500
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

174
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,900
- Man, I ain't done shit.
- Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

175
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Pets, too?

176
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,600
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

177
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,300
Clean this shit before lock-down.

178
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,400
That's four in a row, bitch!

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,300
Wait here, this won't take long.

180
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

181
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,500
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

182
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,100
- There ain't no union without it, brother.
- Your sweetheart's out there.

183
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Who?

184
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

185
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,800
- Kind of empty in here.
- Everyone's working.

186
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,200
- You getting the message?
- The message?

187
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,600
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

188
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,900
you know that?

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

190
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
told them where it was gonna go.

191
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
- You tell Father Lewandowski?
- I was gonna surprise him.

192
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

193
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

194
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,600
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

195
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
- Good for you.
- No, good for you, Frank.

196
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,600
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

197
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
What's right?

198
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,300
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

199
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,300
like a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
But that's not you, it's not your way.

201
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

202
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,200
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

204
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,400
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

205
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

206
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

207
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,400
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

208
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Fuck you! And your window!

209
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,300
Where are you gonna be?

210
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

211
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
- Give me an hour, yeah?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,700
- What the fuck is this?
- A knot.

213
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

214
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,300
So what else we got?

215
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,000
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

216
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,700
- Here's a letter, though.
- A letter? What language?

217
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

218
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,000
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

219
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,900
Can't figure the name or the address...

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

221
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,000
- Where's Magyar?
- What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

222
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,100
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

223
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

224
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
These yours?

225
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,700
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

226
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
She found them, she writes on it.

227
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,000
- I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
- Beatrice Russell.

228
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,100
- You got any IDs yet?
- No visas or passports.

229
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,000
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

230
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

231
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
- Yeah.
- Why?

232
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

233
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
There's no missing person report on file.

234
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,800
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

235
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,300
- Mine was a murder.
- A murder, you're kidding me?

236
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,300
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

237
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
I called the morgue this morning...

238
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,800
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

239
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Overseas, they think.

240
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,800
- Is that your girl?
- Think so.

241
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Looks better here.

242
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,700
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

243
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

244
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

245
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,300
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

246
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,500
- What went wrong?
- Air pipe up top got crushed.

247
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

248
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,400
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

249
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
You had cartons stacked in front...

250
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

251
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
opens from the outside only.

252
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
- They're in here the whole trip?
- Probably not.

253
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,600
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

254
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

255
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,600
He lets them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

256
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
They were clawing at the wall for air.

257
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,000
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

258
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,000
- Where's the air pipe?
- That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

259
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
You get a lot of stowaways?

260
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

261
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

262
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,100
- Not so much from Europe?
- A bit more since 9/11, actually.

263
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,900
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

264
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,300
like they used to. There you go.

265
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,200
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

266
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,900
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

267
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,400
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

268
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
Where was this one?

269
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,100
- Look.
- What?

270
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,500
- That look right to you?
- What do you mean?

271
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,600
- You said you were with the Marine Unit?
- Yeah.

272
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,300
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

273
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,700
Not a thing.

274
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
What do you want me to do?

275
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,400
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

276
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
Switch the windows, maybe.

277
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,400
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

278
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,300
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

279
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,900
I thought you had suction.

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

281
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,600
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

282
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

283
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,900
Now, that's a good question.

284
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,100
I mean, the whole I.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

285
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
and there ain't 100 checkers.

286
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,000
They got the car ships coming in...

287
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,200
the roll-on/roll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
- That's all they got?
- Pretty much.

289
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,500
Past six months,
I.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

290
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

291
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
They've been good
with the political contributions.

292
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,100
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

293
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,100
- How can they?
- You tell me.

294
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,400
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what I think?

296
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,300
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

297
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
You're the cop, not me.

298
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,400
The Grainery?

299
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,800
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

300
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah, I've seen worse.

301
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,900
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

302
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

303
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,000
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

304
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,200
See?

305
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,300
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

306
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
But yeah, from the look of it...

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,300
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

308
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,700
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

309
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,600
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

310
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,300
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

311
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,900
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

313
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,500
- They're pushing Shipley.
- See, that's racist.

314
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,000
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

315
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,800
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

316
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,100
You know what I'm gonna do?

317
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

318
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,600
That'll bring the First District in line.

319
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
That's very kind.

320
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

321
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,100
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

322
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,800
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

323
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
What for?

324
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,900
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

325
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,200
- Port guys, longshoremen.
- I.B.S.?

326
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

328
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

329
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,300
- Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
- No.

330
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

331
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,500
- What's he to you?
- To me?

332
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,800
He's an asshole.

333
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Six men for six weeks.

334
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Rawls will pick them.

335
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
You ordered more than you ate.

336
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
It's cold out here.

337
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,800
You're right. You're always right.

339
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

340
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,900
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

341
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,600
In the basement.

342
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,800
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

343
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,200
Burrell won't be there forever.

344
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,400
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

345
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
But you've got the law degree.

346
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,300
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

347
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,100
You've got options.

348
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
- Just because they don't --
- You're right.

349
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll put in my papers.

350
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,900
- Who wants breakfast?
- Christ, it's about time.

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

352
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

353
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,700
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

354
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
- Who got them?
- New Charles works for Mutt.

355
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,200
Yo, Zig. You working today?

356
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,100
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

357
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

358
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,100
- Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
- That's right, I'm thirsty.

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,100
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

360
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,100
- Nick.
- What's up?

361
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,600
Come here.

362
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,800
- I got a line on something.
- Oh, yeah?

363
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,700
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

364
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,200
- He's gonna stake me to a package.
- A package?

365
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Dope, Nicky, dope.

366
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,300
I got work today, Zig.

367
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,200
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

368
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,100
- So why the fuck you coming to me?
- I want you to come in on it with me.

369
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,900
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

370
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
We turn it around, we both get paid.

371
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,300
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

372
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,300
- Fuck that shit, Zig.
- Time to work!

373
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
- Nicky, come on, man.
- Can I ride with you?

374
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,700
Will you think about it?

375
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,900
Dolores, can I get another shot?

376
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,900
- What's up?
- DWI checkpoint.

377
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

378
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,900
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

379
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

380
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

381
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,100
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

382
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
- That's not in dispute here.
- Good.

383
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

384
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,600
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

385
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,000
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

386
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,800
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

387
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,200
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

388
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,300
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

389
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,900
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

390
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

391
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,300
- 39.4%.
- Bill, like I told you --

392
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,800
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

393
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

394
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,300
The man is a God.

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,500
Big chief.

396
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

397
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah. Come on in, man.

398
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,500
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

399
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,200
- No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
- What?

400
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,000
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

401
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,200
- Better get in this.
- No.

402
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Look, man...

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,700
if he tearing your room down, man...

404
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
we keep bringing more stuff in.

405
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,200
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

406
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,200
He fucked with my fish though, I don't...

407
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
He ain't have to go there, man.

408
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,100
- What's up with this motherfucker?
- You remember Ladontay?

409
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,300
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

410
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,900
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

411
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,600
We did that?

412
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,600
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

413
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,200
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

414
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,500
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

415
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,800
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

416
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,300
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

417
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

418
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

419
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
- What's his name again?
- Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

420
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
I seen him around.

421
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,700
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

422
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,100
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

423
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,400
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

424
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,700
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

425
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,100
Don't fret. All right?

426
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,900
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

427
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,600
The city won't take it?

428
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,900
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

429
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,900
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

430
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Case needs real murder police.

431
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,100
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

432
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
Absolutely. What can you give me?

433
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,000
- This is about fucking over your boss?
- If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

434
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
What do you need?

435
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

436
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,300
13 by 7 by 7.

437
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,500
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

438
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,400
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

439
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,700
per victim.

440
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
- He's a doctor?
- A State Bureau of Mines.

441
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,700
- Minds?
- Mines.

442
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

443
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,700
- Barksdale, right?
- Yeah.

444
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
- Listen, I want to know if you can help me --
- No.

445
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,700
- Pardon me?
- I said, no, motherfucker.

446
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,400
Off the steps.

447
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,900
What the fuck are you up to now?

448
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,900
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

449
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,500
This is bullshit.

450
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
Those computations were checked...

451
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,300
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

452
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

453
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah, so you say.

454
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

455
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,700
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

456
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,400
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

457
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
in American law enforcement.

458
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,200
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

459
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,200
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

460
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,900
then they were murdered on board ship.

461
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
That means Baltimore County...

462
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,000
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

463
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,200
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

464
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,400
This is not a city problem.

465
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,300
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

466
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,500
No, Bill.

467
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,300
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

468
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,400
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

469
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

470
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,900
- By the map, that's Baltimore city.
- And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

471
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,100
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

472
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

473
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,100
Mikey.

474
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,700
- What's up?
- No.

475
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
No, what?

476
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,300
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

477
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

478
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,000
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

479
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

480
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,200
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

481
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Mike, I thought we was friends.

482
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,000
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

483
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,100
- Sort of.
- Are you beat to shit?

484
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,100
- No.
- Take a walk, my friend.

485
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,200
- What's up, man?
- What's up, playboy?

486
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,600
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

487
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,600
So we got that, you know.

488
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

489
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,500
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

490
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,500
- Who?
- Name is Tilghman.

491
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

492
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

493
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,900
Tilghman? Right.

494
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

495
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,300
I know, I heard.

496
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
You need to get with Dee's girl.

497
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,700
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

498
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,100
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

499
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,500
All right.

500
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,500
How's Dee taking it?

501
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

502
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,100
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

503
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,500
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

504
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,700
- No, nothing like that.
- You sure?

505
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,300
- He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
- Stringer, he's family, man.

506
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,200
All right? He's family.

507
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

508
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,600
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

509
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
That's it.

510
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,800
There it is.

511
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,400
- One more, baby, come on.
- There you go.

512
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
- That's enough.
- No.

513
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,300
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

514
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,800
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

515
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

516
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

517
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,300
And Rawls!

518
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,600
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

519
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,400
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

520
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,600
- Careful, you're giving me an erection.
- Come on now.

521
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,200
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

522
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,600
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

523
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

524
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

525
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,100
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

526
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,000
All right.

527
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,700
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

528
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

529
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,600
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

530
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,900
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

531
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,600
And four months.

532
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
Fuck it.

533
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,600
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

534
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,800
- Fourteen.
- He did it.

535
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Fuck.

536
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,100
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

537
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,500
Go that way.

538
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
- Man, anybody still in there?
- They're keeping La-la.

539
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,500
He had an old warrant on him.

540
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,600
- For what?
- I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

541
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,000
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

542
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,000
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

543
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,800
- Jerking us around on the way to work.
- It's a beef I got with a police boss.

544
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,900
- Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
- You gotta get that taken care of, man.

545
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,600
- I mean, this shit is out of hand.
- I'm gonna take care of it.

546
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

547
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,400
- I'll see you.
- All right, talk to you.

548
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,400
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

549
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,000
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

550
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,100
- Bunk, Lester.
- Yeah.

551
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

552
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
What? We're not up, Jay.

553
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,200
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

554
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,000
Cole's gonna take the double.

555
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,400
- You two got pussy in a can.
- Jay, that ain't right.

556
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
You know what ain't right?

557
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,400
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

558
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,100
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

559
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,100
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

560
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
so I got my best people on it.

561
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Ray.

562
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
Lay it on them.

563
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,200
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

564
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,700
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

565
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,300
Motherfucker.

566
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

567
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

568
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,400
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

569
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,100
- What?
- A drunken Irishman.

570
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,900
But you're not really Irish, are you?

571
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,300
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

572
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,300
You're green, all right.

573
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,300
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

574
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
You're a child, McNulty.

575
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,600
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

576
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,800
- I will call the cops.
- Why would you wanna do that?

577
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Jimmy.

578
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,700
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

579
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,200
What the fuck am I, Jimmy?

580
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,800
We're good together.

581
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,900
Answer the question.

582
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,600
I've been pretty honest with you.

583
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,600
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

584
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,200
You know, what with the kids and all...

585
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,100
You got any aspirin?

586
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

587
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,900
A real police department
would have an elevator.

588
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,500
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

589
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
Lester Freamon.

590
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,100
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

591
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,500
What do we know?

592
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,700
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

593
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,200
- I'm trying to get them to hold her.
- Anyone from your CID working this?

594
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,500
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

595
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,800
and your colonel made everybody mad.

596
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,900
- All you get is me.
- Still on hold?

597
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,500
We can call this in from the road.

598
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,400
You're with City Homicide?

599
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,700
- You must know Jimmy McNulty.
- Yeah, he's dead to us.

600
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,400
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

601
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,700
I've seen worse.

602
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,200
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

603
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,500
- Furnace work?
- It does.

604
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,100
And the phone lines.

605
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,600
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

606
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
but somehow I got a feeling...

607
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,900
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

608
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,800
Now, this here...

609
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,200
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

610
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,900
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

611
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,900
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

612
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,800
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

613
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,500
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

614
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,100
So who signs the overtime slips?

615
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,000
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

616
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,500
- This is where our taxes go.
- I do good work, don't I?

617
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,200
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

618
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,200
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

619
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,900
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

620
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,800
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

621
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,800
Finishing touch, boys.

622
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,700
Bon voyage.

623
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,200
There she goes.

624
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,600
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

625
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,600
- Amir, why don't we sail?
- They're holding the ship.

626
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
- Who?
- Coast Guard, the Americans.

627
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Why?

628
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,100
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

629
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,200
Bring him up!

630
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,100
- Have a good day, Officer.
- Okay, I'll see you.

631
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,500
Now get up in there.

632
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,800
Last call before lock-down.

633
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,900
Make it snappy now.

634
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,600
- How you like that?
- It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

635
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,400
Nice. Smooth.

636
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,900
Most def, man.

637
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,700
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

638
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,400
- What up, man?
- Yeah, he left that in here.

639
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,200
It's his.

640
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,000
- So how you doing?
- All right.

641
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,600
Yeah?

642
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,100
Me and you gonna need to talk.

643
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,200
- So who's on board?
- Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

644
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,600
Eight are Sri Lankan.

645
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,600
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

646
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,100
- Anybody speak English?
- What you're asking them about...

647
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,100
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

648
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,400
- Where's your captain?
- At the Coast Guard office.

649
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,800
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

650
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,300
You ain't gonna make it.

651
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,900
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

652
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,300
- The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
- The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

653
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,100
Don't try to play tough guy.

654
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,200
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

655
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,900
Talk to me!

656
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,100
Tell me what I need to know.

657
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,000
Get him up.

658
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,600
- Talk about the girls.
- No girls, nothing.

659
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,300
No English.

660
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

661
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,700
Why you run from ship?

662
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,000
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

663
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,600
They got him in Philadelphia.

664
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,900
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

665
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,900
- What is he?
- Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

666
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,400
He don't know nothing.

667
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,900
But you kept hitting him anyway.

668
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,100
Get his clothes.

669
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,400
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

670
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,300
- Come on, let's talk.
- No English.

671
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,600
Tell me what happened to the girls?

672
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
No speak.

673
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,900
What then? What do you speak?

674
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,900
Come on, talk to me, friend.

675
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,300
Turkish?

676
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,100
You got that little hook on your nose.

677
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,400
Don't worry, patrioti.

678
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,400
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

679
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,100
Sam.

680
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,200
- I don't know nothing about --
- You know.

681
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,000
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

682
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,800
you're done, I give you my word.

683
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,300
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

684
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,700
Get some fresh air.

685
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,400
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

686
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,300
These girls, they looked pretty good.

687
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,200
- Katalavenis?
- Yes.

688
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,300
The men had cash to spend.

689
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,900
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

690
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
What happened?

691
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,400
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

692
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,200
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

693
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,200
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

694
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,200
- You kill one, then you kill them all.
- No, that was another man.

695
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,200
Another man, what man?

696
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,600
The one girl...

697
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
they saw, they knew.

698
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,100
Relax.

699
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,200
I gave you my word.

700
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,800
- Watch your shoes.
- Goddamn Turko.

701
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,400
Bleeds like a lamb.

702
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,300
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

703
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,200
$4 million.

704
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Gone.

705
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,600
Malaka.

706
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,500
Anyway, there will be other girls.

707
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,900
This one...

708
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,000
no fingerprints.

709
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,000
- No face.
- That's not a problem.
