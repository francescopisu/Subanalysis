1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
WMD. Got that WMD here.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
- This shit right here?
- The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,900
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
So this the hi-test?

6
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,800
Same shit, new name.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,800
You be all right.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,500
Okay, get dressed.

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,400
And don't forget that book bag neither.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,900
You got your chrome, young one?

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,700
I'll take mine.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
Let's go.

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
They coming up the alley!

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
They coming back!

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,300
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,800
Slide up.

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,000
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,200
- You hear me, boy?
- Okay, Mama.

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Come on!

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Fuck!

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,300
Shit!

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,100
- Why you running?
- What the fuck?

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh, shit!

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,800
Hit that nigger cold.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Bitches!

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Why you hiding?

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,100
Drama done with, boy.

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,500
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Get in, damn it!

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,000
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

34
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,600
I told you, you gotta get ready...

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No!

36
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,300
They're changing up?

37
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

38
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,300
- That shipment is tomorrow.
- Got it.

39
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

40
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,700
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

41
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,500
Now listen.

42
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Pyramid, Inc. May I help you?

43
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,100
- You got them Davinas or what?
- I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,900
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

46
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
since we followed that truck off the docks.

47
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,300
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

48
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,900
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cellphone since.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
- We tipped our hand somewhere.
- That second can, maybe.

50
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,200
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

51
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,100
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

52
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,800
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
- What?
- They probably changed that up, too.

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
If they think we're onto them...

55
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

57
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,100
- Just to see if we pull them up.
- Which we did.

58
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,900
Which I did.

59
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,400
No, they're not on us completely.

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,000
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

61
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,500
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
waiting us out.

63
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,600
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

64
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,400
Don't waste film.

65
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,700
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
Anything?

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,100
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

68
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Little late.

69
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

70
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,700
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

72
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,300
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

73
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,100
D.C.? What for?

74
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,300
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,300
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

76
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,100
So what do we got?

77
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,100
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

78
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

79
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,600
- Dead?
- Pronounced at University.

80
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
- Witnesses?
- No one offering a name...

81
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,000
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

82
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,800
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

83
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,400
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

84
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,200
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

85
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,000
Fucking pointless.

86
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

87
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,800
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

88
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,200
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

89
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,000
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

90
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
You'll feel better when you do.

91
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,400
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

92
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,500
- You said that --
- I said change the name of our product.

93
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,100
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

94
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,900
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,300
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

96
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

97
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,600
Who shot the young one?

98
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

99
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean --

100
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,900
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
They got to.

102
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,400
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,500
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

105
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,300
I know, String.

106
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm sorry, man.

107
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,700
Let me tell you something, man.

108
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,200
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

109
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
the corner you hold.

110
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,700
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

111
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,400
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

112
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Give and take on both sides.

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,400
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

115
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,200
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

116
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,100
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

117
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,100
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

118
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
All right.

119
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Coming up.

120
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,900
I got people waiting on a package from me...

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,700
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police...

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,000
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,500
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

124
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
But, Niko...

125
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,000
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

126
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,200
Why not?

127
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,900
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

128
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

129
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,100
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

130
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,600
Call that number.

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
- Talk to him.
- Mike?

132
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
This White Mike?

133
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,400
- You know him?
- From Curtis Bay.

134
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

135
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

136
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Now, for the rest of our business...

137
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

138
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
Take them to Newkirk Street.

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

140
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,900
or we will see the police.

141
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,500
If not, no more worries.

142
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,900
All right.

143
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
We are off the warehouse phone now?

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

145
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,700
This is bullshit.

146
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,500
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

147
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Five-O!

148
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

149
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,400
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

150
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Come on, keep moving.

151
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,900
Get him. Down.

152
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,800
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

153
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,100
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

154
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

155
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
- Just shut the fuck up.
- Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

156
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,500
- What are you doing in the Pit then?
- Saying no to drugs.

157
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,500
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

158
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

159
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

160
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,100
Slide over, asshole.

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

162
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
What exactly is it that we're doing?

163
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,900
Young boy killed over bullshit.

164
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

165
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,600
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

166
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,300
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

167
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,800
I'll be out there selling that real.

168
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,800
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

169
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,500
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

170
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,700
You're Westside.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,900
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

172
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
No.

173
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

174
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,100
- Sollers?
- Sold heroin like it was water.

176
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

177
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

178
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,100
I know you don't.

179
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,400
And the police don't.

180
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,300
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

181
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,000
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

182
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,300
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

184
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,000
I know. I been there.

185
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
But you ain't gotta live by it.

186
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,700
Avon's a soldier.

187
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,500
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

188
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
But as far as business go...

189
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,300
- You still got that connect?
- Right off the boat, String.

190
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
All right.

191
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

192
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,800
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

193
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,600
You can have 734, 770 and 221.

194
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,100
I keep the other three.

195
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

196
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,200
It makes sense, don't it?

197
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,600
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

198
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,600
Right?

199
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
No shit.

200
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,500
- I thought you was in with Nicky.
- Fuck Nick.

201
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
He said you was his other half.

202
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,700
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

203
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

204
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

205
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,300
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

206
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,700
A man can grow.

207
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,000
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

208
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm telling you.

209
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
You want in?

210
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
- What do I gotta do?
- What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

211
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,700
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

212
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

213
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

214
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
New Charles in the house.

215
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
- Moving pretty good.
- Waiting on a prosthetic.

216
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,000
You got a decent lawyer?

217
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,900
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

218
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,300
What's with the duck?

219
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
- You know you gotta let go of your name.
- Say what?

220
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,900
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

221
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

222
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,900
You know what? "Peg."

223
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
"New Peggy."

224
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,900
- How about "Tilt"?
- Tilt?

225
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,900
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Tilt. I like that.

227
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

228
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

229
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,500
- So, this is your first time?
- Yep, first time for me.

230
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,500
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

231
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,300
- Do you work with the police?
- No. Christ, no.

232
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,000
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know...

233
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
- Where do you live?
- I'm not gonna tell you that.

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,700
I live out of town.

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,100
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

236
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Thank you.

237
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,400
You sucked. I mean, really.

238
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

239
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,300
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

240
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,400
Hey, fucknuts.

241
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

242
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,900
Christ, Ziggy.

243
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

244
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
What's up with my cousin?

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,100
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

246
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,300
- Drank himself to death.
- Oh, shit.

247
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,700
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

248
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
That boy ain't right.

249
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,500
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

250
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,800
La-Z-Boys?

251
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,900
And Davinas. Male and female.

252
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,700
Dope and coke.

253
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
- What the hell is a Davina?
- It's like a love seat, kind of.

254
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,600
- Any line on weight?
- All whole numbers.

255
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,000
- No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
- Ounces?

256
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

257
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,200
Nothing much above five.

258
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

259
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,500
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

260
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,200
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

261
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,500
- What was coming and going last night?
- Not much.

262
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

263
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,800
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

264
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,100
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

265
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,500
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

266
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,900
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

268
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,400
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

269
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,700
All we need is the new number.

270
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

271
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

272
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,700
Probably going to a cellphone.

273
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cellphone.

274
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,300
Okay, then.

275
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

276
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,800
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

277
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,200
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

278
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,800
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

279
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,600
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

280
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
But so far, the people handling the girls...

281
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

282
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,300
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

283
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,700
Questions?

284
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,300
What was your play with those girls?

285
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Out-of-town salesman.

286
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
- How far out of town?
- What do you mean?

287
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Less like a cop you sound.

289
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,900
You do any accents?

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,100
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

291
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Crikey!

292
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,200
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

293
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,800
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

294
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Work on it, son.

295
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
$200,000?

296
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,600
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

297
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,700
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

298
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,100
- And then?
- That is all.

299
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,600
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

300
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
They are cheats.

301
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
- The chemicals we sent are good, no?
- No complaint.

302
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,800
They say they want more, even.

303
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,800
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

304
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,300
Right.

305
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
- And still, they try to chisel.
- Why?

306
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,900
What are they thinking?

307
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,800
That it is all profit for us.

308
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,000
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

309
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,900
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

310
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,000
The Greek will be angry.

311
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
This is business, Eton.

312
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
The Greek? He will be smart.

313
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Jesus.

314
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

315
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

316
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,600
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

317
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,000
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

318
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,400
Said the crime will not stand.

319
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,300
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

320
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,700
How about the street talk?

321
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,700
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

322
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

323
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,000
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

324
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
around one of our interrogation rooms?

325
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,900
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

326
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,800
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

327
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,800
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,900
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

329
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,200
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

330
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,800
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

331
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,200
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

332
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Nothing stripped.

333
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,800
- Off the docks?
- No shit, off the docks.

334
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,700
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

335
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Twenty on the dollar.

336
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,400
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

337
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

338
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

339
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,500
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

340
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,600
A stolen car is a stolen car.

341
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,400
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

342
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,600
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

343
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,400
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

344
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,200
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

345
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,900
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

346
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,300
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

347
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,700
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

348
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,100
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

349
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,100
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

350
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,300
Stepney and Mersey.

351
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,600
Excuse me?

352
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

353
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,900
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

354
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,700
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

355
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,700
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

356
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
Good work.

357
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,000
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

358
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,500
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

359
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,300
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

360
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,500
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

361
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
One other thing.

362
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,800
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

363
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,700
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

364
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,700
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

365
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,200
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

366
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,200
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

367
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,800
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

368
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,900
So what? You do that to everybody.

369
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,900
This is George Glekas.

370
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,300
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

371
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Run his ass, too.

372
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,300
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

373
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,400
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

374
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
is gonna suspect an inside job.

375
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,600
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

376
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

377
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,700
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

378
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Why bother?

379
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

380
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,800
That ain't the plan.

381
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,900
I just saw a can disappear.

382
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,400
- Talco line?
- Pakusa working it?

383
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,400
- It's him. Do we try to follow?
- We know where it's going, right?

384
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,100
12-08, you copy?

385
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,300
12-08, what's up?

386
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,700
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

387
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,100
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

388
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,300
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

389
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,300
- What do you want us to do with it?
- See if it arrives.

390
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
And if it does?

391
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,100
See what happens then.

392
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,300
You wanna know something, Carv?

393
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,100
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
we're not really respected.

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,800
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

396
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,300
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

397
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
Who do I tell?

398
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,000
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

399
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,000
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

400
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

401
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Here...

402
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

403
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,300
to some fucking dustbowl
Indian res in Arkansas.

404
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,500
- Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
- Fuck it.

405
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,700
What you got there, brother?

406
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
White boys. A different look for you.

407
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,900
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

408
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,300
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

409
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

410
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
You said Customs had intel on him?

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,300
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

412
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,400
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

413
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Got something out of San Diego.

414
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
- On Glekas?
- We'll see.

415
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

416
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

417
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,800
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

418
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,100
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

419
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,000
Agent Koutris?

420
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,800
Not much to it.

421
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,100
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

422
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,500
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

423
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,900
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

424
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,700
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

425
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
All right.

426
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,600
If you need it, let me know.

427
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,000
We need to talk.

428
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,500
Anyone following?

429
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

430
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,700
- All week I've done it. Nothing.
- Again.

431
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,700
The truck is here.

432
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,700
Lester, it's here.

433
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,000
They offload anything?

434
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,400
Not yet.

435
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay, wait on it.

436
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,200
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

437
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,500
You are.

438
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,800
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

439
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,800
He doesn't think so.

440
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,500
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

441
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

442
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,500
We know what happened.

443
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,400
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

444
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
Where that lawyer at, man?

445
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,200
See, you just fucked up.

446
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,200
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

447
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,900
That's you, right there, fucking up.

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,600
- I don't know what you talking about.
- No, you fucked up.

449
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,600
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

450
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
Which one?

451
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,600
That's you right there.

452
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,900
Lawyer.

453
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
They were asking about me?

454
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
San Diego.

455
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,900
San Diego was a long time ago.

456
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

457
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,800
Only that the people asked.

458
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,100
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

459
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,500
They were.

460
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
No FBI.

461
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,800
We've been running only clean containers?

462
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,600
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

463
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,700
No one stops anything.

464
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
And we changed the warehouse phone?

465
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,700
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

466
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,300
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

467
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,700
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

468
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,300
Fair is fair.

469
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,600
The Colombians, I think.

470
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,100
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

471
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,500
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

472
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,200
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

473
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,200
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

474
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,700
They're trash.

475
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,600
The world is a smaller place now.

476
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,200
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

477
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,300
Fair is fair.

478
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Sergei's making a call.

479
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

480
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,300
I will meet you there.

481
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,900
Recognize that voice?

482
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,100
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

483
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,000
- That's the same guy?
- Same guy, new number.

484
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,500
- Who you calling?
- Pearlman, at home.

485
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

486
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Shit is raw, String.

487
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,600
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

488
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,200
All right.

489
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,400
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

490
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,000
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

491
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,300
All right.

492
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,100
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

493
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
Start connecting the dots...

494
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,000
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

495
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,900
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

496
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,600
FBI didn't have much.

497
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,800
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

498
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,000
- In a stolen goods case that was closed out.
- San Diego?

499
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,400
These guys move around.

500
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,700
- What's with the suit?
- Date night.

501
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,300
The undercover at the brothel.

502
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Run like hell, ma'am.

503
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,800
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

504
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,600
Who's the affiant?

505
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,600
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

506
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,700
Whatever you need, chief.

507
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,900
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

508
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,300
Whatever you have.

509
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,600
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

510
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
It's a long story.

511
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,900
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so...

512
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,900
Listen...

513
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,700
you think I can get an advance on this?

514
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,200
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

515
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
- I'm just asking.
- Payment on delivery.

516
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,500
Don't worry about it, chief.

517
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,300
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

518
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,000
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

519
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,100
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

520
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

521
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,000
No, that's not enough.

522
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,400
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

523
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,200
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

524
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

525
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
But when push come to shove...

526
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

527
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

528
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,000
- Hold up, String --
- No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

529
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,500
You drive the guns to the water.

530
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,000
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

531
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
In the water.

532
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
Splash.

533
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,900
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

534
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,400
Except you, young one.

535
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,500
You ain't say shit back there?

536
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,400
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

537
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,600
And I wiped them shits down myself.

538
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,200
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

539
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,500
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

540
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
- All right.
- All right, String.

541
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,100
Lock that door.

542
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

543
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,200
Got two in the window there.

544
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You hung this on a duck?

545
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,300
Of course.

546
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,100
$1,200.

547
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,200
Fair enough.

548
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,100
- Nick.
- It's been a while, Mikey.

549
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,800
Yeah, it has.

550
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,700
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

551
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,900
Yeah?

552
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
My man called.

553
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,200
Said you was gonna take are-up from me.

554
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,500
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

555
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,500
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

556
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Who fucking knew?

557
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
- So how much you looking for?
- Two or three G-packs a week.

558
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,100
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

559
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,700
- Four each.
- Four?

560
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I wholesale for five, man.

561
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,700
I don't know.

562
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,900
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

563
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
Sergei. What up, dawg?

564
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,200
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

565
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,300
Yeah?

566
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,100
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

567
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
Another thing.

568
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,300
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

569
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,700
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

570
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

571
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,800
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

572
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,200
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

573
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,200
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

574
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,000
Idiot.

575
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,700
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

576
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,600
- Four a pack for you.
- All right, cool.

577
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,600
Thank God for the Russian's cellphone.

578
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,800
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

579
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,400
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

580
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,400
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

581
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,200
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a man's purse.

582
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,000
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

583
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,800
Them people ain't right over there.

584
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,300
The Mike has to go somewhere.

585
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

586
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
Indeed I might, luv.

587
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,200
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

588
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,900
You want us in, you say... What was it?

589
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,500
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

590
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,400
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

591
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,000
then an overt attempt to engage.

592
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,500
Spot on.

593
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,600
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

594
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,200
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

595
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,900
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

596
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
Middle Atlantic region probably.

597
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,500
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

598
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

599
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,700
Congratulations, Frank.

600
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,800
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

601
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,000
So, Nat, about the election.

602
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,900
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

603
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,700
That's what I need.

604
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Ott's turn, Frank.

605
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

606
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,600
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

607
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,500
- Terrorism?
- He needs our help tonight.

608
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,600
11-34, what's your 20?

609
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,900
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

610
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,000
Copy that.

611
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,500
Okay, we're on here.

612
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,400
Good evening.

613
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,200
Paint pigments.

614
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,700
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

615
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's in there somewhere.

616
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,600
Run it.

617
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,800
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

618
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,200
- Nothing else in there, really.
- Nothing but the pigments.

619
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,300
- What's going on?
- I don't know nothing, Horse.

620
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,600
Swear to God.

621
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,000
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

622
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,700
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

623
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,400
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

624
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,400
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

625
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,900
You think so?

626
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,100
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

627
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,500
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

628
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,200
and what happened?

629
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
He feel for that.

630
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,700
He feel for you.

631
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,000
I know he didn't see it coming.

632
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,000
- None of us seen it coming.
- I did.

633
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,900
I swear, I saw it.

634
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,000
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

635
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,000
'Cause we got a weak product...

636
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,100
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

637
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,600
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

638
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,700
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

639
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,000
I know.

640
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,900
But them wolves is at that door.

641
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,800
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

642
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,300
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

643
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,600
So I'll talk to him.

644
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,900
Mr. Cromwell.

645
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,000
Decisions, decisions.

646
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,200
Would it be wrong to take two?

647
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,300
Attaboy.

648
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,300
We should get upstairs.

649
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,500
Nothing but paint pigments.

650
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,000
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

651
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,000
Son of a bitch!

652
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,400
Okay, then.

653
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,900
Right.

654
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,700
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

655
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,200
Any time you guys want.

656
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,300
The money changed hands, right?

657
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,000
Sounded that way.

658
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,200
- And they talked about sex?
- Definitely.

659
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,100
Any time you guys want.

660
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,400
Hang on.

661
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Oh, God.

662
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,500
Is it soup yet?

663
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,600
Spot something. Spot on it.

664
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Let's go.

665
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,100
- Whoa.
- Why?

666
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,400
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

667
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,600
Calm the fuck down.

668
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,000
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

669
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,100
- Who is it?
- Baltimore police.

670
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,700
- What do you want?
- To lock your ass up.

671
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
Hands. Let me see them.

672
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,500
- Two more in the back.
- Come on, ladies.

673
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,500
You're late.

674
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,500
He okay?

675
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,100
He'll live.

676
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,500
...estimated at 1,125 kilograms
of processed crack cocaine...

677
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,900
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

678
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,700
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

679
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,600
that their investigation is ongoing...

680
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,700
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

681
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,300
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

682
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,400
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist --

683
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,800
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

684
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,700
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

685
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,900
I would die happy.

686
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,300
Our case is progressing.

687
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
- Great, what can you charge?
- We're not at that point.

688
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,200
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

689
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,000
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

690
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,200
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

691
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,300
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

692
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,600
And last night, if you check the 24s...

693
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,200
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

694
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,200
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

695
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,800
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

696
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,700
- You hit a brothel?
- Waterfront condo, high-end.

697
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,500
Jesus.

698
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,400
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

699
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,100
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

700
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Any problems on the raid?

701
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,200
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

702
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,100
Immigration is holding the girls.

703
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,700
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

704
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,900
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

705
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,200
Not while the taps are up.

706
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,400
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

707
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,200
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

708
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,800
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

709
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,400
then, yeah, we're closer.

710
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,000
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

711
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,200
What about Frank Sobotka?

712
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

713
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,000
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

714
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,100
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

715
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,500
This is about Frank Sobotka.

716
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,800
The case is bigger now.

717
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,900
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

718
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,400
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

719
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,000
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

720
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,700
and a chance at the real targets.

721
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,200
- He is the real target.
- Patience, Stan.

722
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,500
- I'm sure if they bring the case --
- You owe me on this, Erv.

723
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,100
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

724
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,600
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

725
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,000
Okay.

726
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,200
Now the votes are in...

727
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,300
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

728
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,500
now you're freezing me out, huh?

729
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,800
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

730
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,300
This is my case.

731
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,900
Mine!

732
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,600
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

733
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,100
Not fucking likely.

734
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,300
He's saying no.

735
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,300
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

736
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,900
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

737
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

738
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,500
and we might never get out from under.

739
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,200
- We don't have the product or the muscle.
- I told him.

740
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,200
I did.

741
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,400
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

742
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,200
And for muscle...

743
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,200
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

744
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,000
Brother Mouzone.

745
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,000
He sending in Brother?

746
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,400
From New York.

747
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,000
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

748
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,800
- Brother Mouzone?
- Yep.

749
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,700
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

750
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,500
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

751
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,800
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

752
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,400
You're famous behind this, you know that?

753
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,700
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

754
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,200
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

755
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,700
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

756
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,700
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

757
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,300
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

758
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,500
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

759
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,300
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

760
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,700
You fucking with me, right?

761
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

762
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,100
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

763
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,400
- Played it like that.
- Yeah, and he reached out.

764
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,400
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

765
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

766
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,300
Deal with how?

767
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,000
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

768
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,500
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

769
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,600
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

770
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,900
Shit.

771
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,200
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

772
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,300
True.

773
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,900
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

774
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,800
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

775
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,500
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

776
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,800
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

777
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,300
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

778
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,100
And that's like a week or maybe two.

779
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,800
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

780
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,900
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

781
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,800
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

782
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
All right?

783
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,400
12-08 to 11-37, you there?

784
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,800
11-37, what you got?

785
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,200
That last truck is on the move.

786
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,100
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

787
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,400
- 10-4.
- They're testing us.

788
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,600
They been moving clean cans.

789
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,200
- The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
- No?

790
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,400
- We just took out the last of it. No problems.
- Okay, then we go.

791
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,300
- What about Ilona?
- She is home. They kept the children.

792
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,900
There are always more children.

793
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,800
Why don't we tap that cellphone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

794
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,300
That call might just be our PC.

795
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,800
And this here is the little king of everything.

796
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,100
So how many we got in the sector?

797
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

798
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,800
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

799
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,700
We're on every corner.

800
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Pretty damn quiet today.

801
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,400
Today.

802
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,300
Let's go.

803
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,200
Officer.
