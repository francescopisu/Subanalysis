1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,800
What's up?

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,800
Great view.

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Harbor, I mean.

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,000
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,400
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,200
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,200
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Good anchorage, good cranes...

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,000
good railroads, close to I-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,100
That's my fucking town.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,100
Except, the thing is,
we're another 110 miles...

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,100
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,600
So why come?

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
fast and clean through the port.

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,500
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
and will make sure your cargo...

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,100
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
outside Patapsco terminal?

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,500
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,100
The cameras come back.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm serious.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,300
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
They're gone. We turned them over already.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
To who?

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,800
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,400
- I don't need this shit right now.
- I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,400
- You ain't hearing me!
- What? You think this shit is easy?

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,700
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,500
You need money, you come to me.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,300
on the docks lately.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,500
- No doubt, his pockets are full.
- You think it's for me?

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,200
Is that what you think?

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
It ain't about me, Nick!

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I know, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,500
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,800
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Come on, let's go to work.

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,200
How much?

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
Twenty.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,700
- Three-way split.
- Who's the inside man?

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,900
You don't know?

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,300
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

52
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,100
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
Yeah.

54
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,400
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

55
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

56
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
This was intentional?

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,100
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,400
with all kinds of chemicals.

59
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,400
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,400
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

61
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,200
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,500
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

64
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,700
What do they wanna know?

65
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,100
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

66
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
It got in like everything gets in.

67
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,600
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

71
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
We need to show the flag on this.

72
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
What do you mean?

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
If this case gets made from an informant...

75
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,800
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

76
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,200
if you're ready to shave some years.

77
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,500
Colonel.

78
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,400
- Jimmy.
- Winona.

79
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,600
Gilligan, little buddy.

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Don't you have a job?

81
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Ouch!

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I smell fresh police work.

83
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,200
Okay, be like that.

84
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,400
You got some paper from inside the can?

85
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

86
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,100
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

87
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,900
- You got the submission slips?
- He does.

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,200
- Lester.
- You want to pull all of it?

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,700
Hold it.

90
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,900
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

92
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,000
I got a full set of Ilene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,500
- No problem, I got you covered.
- You found Omar?

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,700
I never lost him, my friend.

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
- He's got Omar?
- Bullshit.

96
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
Who's Omar?

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
My papers are in.

98
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
They are.

99
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,000
You want out, you're out.

100
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,700
- You and me.
- Why?

102
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,400
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,900
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,300
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

105
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,900
People you can trust.

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
And you ain't that?

107
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,600
All right. You're a snake.

108
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
But you seem to know your business.

109
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,300
Why not put it off for a year or two...

111
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,300
leave the department
with a major's pension?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

113
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,800
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

114
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,200
and you'll have that posting.

115
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Why would you do that?

116
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,900
I value you, Cedric.

117
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,300
You're arrogant and disloyal.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,100
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,200
- What's the detail?
- Drug case, probably.

120
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,100
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

121
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,400
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

122
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
He thinks they've got too much money.

123
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

124
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
That it? Pretty thin.

125
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,400
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,700
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

127
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
feeling he got his money's worth.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,700
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,900
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

130
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,900
How about this?

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
If I bring in the case...

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,800
within CID.

134
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,200
Fair enough.

135
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,000
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

136
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
- A drug case or two.
- One other thing.

137
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

138
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,200
I choose my own people.

139
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,400
Fuck me once, shame on you.

140
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
- Fuck me twice --
- Make a list.

141
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,200
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

142
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,400
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

143
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,300
I mean, Tae? Lizard? If it was a hotshot...

144
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

145
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

146
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,300
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,900
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,100
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

149
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
Fucking-A right.

150
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,300
Jane Doe, number five.

151
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,100
Five.

152
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
What's up, baby?

153
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,300
Not here, put it away.

154
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Shot and a beer, darling.

155
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Kept one for yourself, did you?

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,300
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

157
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,700
- You even got film in that bitch?
- No, it's digital.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
I know it's digital, so what?

159
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,300
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

160
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,500
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

161
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,700
Thanks.

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Ziggy.

163
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,200
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

164
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Hell, no.

165
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,400
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

166
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,700
- Also, your father knows.
- How does he know?

167
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,500
Horse saw us, right?

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,900
Fuck me, he told?

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

170
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

171
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
What did you say?

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,600
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

173
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,100
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

174
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
At you, maybe.

175
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Anyway.

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,700
It's low profile for a while, all right?

177
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
All right.

178
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,700
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

179
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,900
- To get it turned around?
- No, it goes on a computer.

180
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
I got to take a leak.

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
I go next, all right?

182
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

183
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Christ, Ziggy.

184
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,700
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

186
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,700
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

187
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,200
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

188
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Okay? Great.

189
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,900
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

190
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
Motherfucker, I am serious.

191
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

192
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,200
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

193
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,500
and we haven't heard from you.

194
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
Give us a call, please.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,600
McNulty, this is your dear friend
Ilene Nathan.

196
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

197
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,500
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness...

198
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a...

199
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,400
- Go around, asshole.
- What'd you call me?

200
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm sleeping on this side.

201
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,500
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

202
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,600
Yup.

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

204
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,600
- If I could fart now, I would.
- That's a surprise.

205
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
No chance for breakfast?

206
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
No. I'll stop by the bar.

207
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,100
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

208
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,500
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

209
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

210
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,000
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

211
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,900
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

213
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

214
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,100
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

215
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,100
They're decent people.

216
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,100
- We ain't got time.
- I know.

217
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,000
- So, why you grabbing?
- They were staring right at me.

218
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll meet you out back.

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,900
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,500
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

221
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,700
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

222
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
- Who are they?
- Local 1514.

223
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,100
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

224
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

225
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

226
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
- Or not.
- Or not.

227
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
So we need to talk to a checker.

228
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

229
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Black, white, Polish, Irish, Italian,
it doesn't matter.

230
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,300
No one talks to police.

231
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,300
How do you make a case then?

232
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
I patrol.

233
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,500
I write traffic tickets.

234
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

235
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,000
I take a report.

236
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,400
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

237
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

238
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
- I keep writing.
- That's the job?

239
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
How long you been on?

240
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
- Two years.
- What did you do before that?

241
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,100
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

242
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

243
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,100
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

244
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,700
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

245
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,300
read the MDOT job posting.

246
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,500
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

247
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,200
Toll-taking days were over?

248
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,300
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

249
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
hasn't so much as called in three years.

250
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,100
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

251
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
Not with kids, I wasn't.

252
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
Did you want to be a police?

253
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,300
- Could've been me the other night.
- True.

254
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,000
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

255
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

257
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

258
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

259
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,300
- How did you know?
- I did as your uncle should...

260
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
You knew.

262
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

263
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,300
I might know who did, though.

264
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

265
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

266
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,900
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

267
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,700
Play or you gonna get played.

268
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,200
That's what I need to know.

270
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,500
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

271
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,700
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

272
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,300
Once you done with all that...

273
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

274
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,200
And not just for me, for you, too.

275
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,300
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

276
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
They need him to fall. And you know what?

277
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,300
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

278
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,200
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

279
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
and we can get some of our lives back.

280
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
You dig?

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
So, stay close.

282
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,100
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

283
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,100
we got it all covered.

284
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,900
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,500
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

286
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,100
Whatever it is.

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
Anyone seen Omar?

288
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
We're back in!

289
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Six ships in one day.

290
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,100
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

291
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,400
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

292
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
- What the fuck are you wearing?
- Italian leather, all right?

293
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

294
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,200
- How much does that shit cost?
- $2,000.

295
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

296
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,000
Fuck it.

297
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,500
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

298
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,200
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

299
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,000
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

300
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,400
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

301
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,700
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

302
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,600
- I'm gonna walk, all right?
- See you.

303
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
What?

304
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,800
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

305
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,800
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

306
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,700
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

307
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,800
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

308
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,000
I do.

309
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,100
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

310
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,600
What about?

311
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
We did good by them.

312
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah?

313
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,300
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

314
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,300
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

315
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,100
All right, no problem.

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,200
- All right. See you later.
- See you.

317
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Yo, quit it.

318
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Gentlemen.

319
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,600
We don't need that now.

320
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,900
- Say what?
- I don't give a shit about drugs.

321
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,300
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

322
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

323
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,400
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

324
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,200
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

325
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,600
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

326
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,200
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

327
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Does anyone know where he hangs?

328
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,900
Who he's running with?

329
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600
What he's driving?

330
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,900
Fuck you, Officer.

331
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,700
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

332
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
It won't take the cut like it did before.

333
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,800
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

334
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Came in at 25.

335
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

336
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,900
And lose my money?

337
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,800
I lose my money.

338
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Step on that motherfucker.

339
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,900
How hard?

340
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
Make it 10.

341
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
- It's shit now.
- I know.

342
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,300
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

343
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,700
Which leaves us the port itself.

344
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

345
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
was supposed to pick that container up.

346
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Which is why it stays on the dock.

347
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,900
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

348
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

349
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Bottom line for me is different.

350
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,700
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

351
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,100
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

352
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,300
Sir, the witnesses --

353
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,900
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

354
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
with a cocksucker's lisp.

355
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,000
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

356
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,600
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

357
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,500
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

358
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,000
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

359
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,500
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

360
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,100
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

361
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,300
So what can I tell you?

362
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,700
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

363
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
trying to explain what happened.

364
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
So, work it as you see fit...

365
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,800
but understand...

366
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,100
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

367
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
I got one to throw.

368
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Fuck me.

369
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
What did you want to talk to us about?

370
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,800
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

371
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,800
Like what?

372
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,400
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

373
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,200
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

374
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Stuff we need is not like that.

375
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
No?

376
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,100
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

377
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,100
- Chemicals?
- It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

378
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,600
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

379
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,000
No. We need much.

380
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

381
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

382
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,300
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

383
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,100
Good money for those.

384
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
How much?

385
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,200
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

386
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
- Eight?
- I'll look into it.

387
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
Yo, Bubbles!

388
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
McNulty.

389
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,900
My meanest man.

390
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Get in the car.

391
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Where you been at, brother?

392
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,300
What did you get? Walkman.

393
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,400
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

394
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Taxation without representation, you know?

395
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,200
I don't want much. I need Omar.

396
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Wild Omar?

397
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,700
You want us to wander around town...

398
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,500
looking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

399
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

400
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,600
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

401
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,400
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

402
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,700
- Here.
- Keep it, part of my tax.

403
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Your tax is Omar.

404
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,900
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

405
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Fuck!

406
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,800
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

407
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,800
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

408
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,500
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

409
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
Cellblock talk is cheap.

410
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

411
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,300
- If that's what you're interested in.
- Your terms?

412
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,200
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

413
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,100
We'd like to trim that to a year...

414
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

415
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,800
for work release and early parole.

416
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,700
One year on a seven-year bit?

417
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,700
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

418
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

419
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,600
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

420
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,300
and staff at MCI.

421
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,800
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

422
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
He has no priors whatsoever.

423
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,600
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

424
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,100
- No, sir.
- You don't remember that?

425
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,500
I remember the officer got shot.

426
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,400
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

427
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

428
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

429
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,500
"it's bad on everyone."

430
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,900
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

431
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,300
on what happened to your friend.

432
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

433
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,300
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

434
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,100
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

435
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,600
Or the day after.

436
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,100
Consider the offer.

437
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
But the next time we talk...

438
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,200
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

439
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,900
Tuna surprise?

440
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,300
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

441
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
How about a meal for that kind of day?

442
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,700
- Where's Pop?
- He's at the bar with the horses.

443
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,800
Go tell him it's dinner.

444
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,100
- We winning, Pop?
- Nicko.

445
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,200
You up today?

446
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,200
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

447
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

448
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,400
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

449
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,300
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

450
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,300
Try your system out for real.

451
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,900
Too tempting.

452
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,700
Just once.

453
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

454
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,100
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

455
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,400
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

456
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,900
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

457
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,600
She still floats?

458
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,900
Of course she still floats.

459
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,100
You ever miss it, Pop?

460
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,300
Wouldn't do no good.

461
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,700
What's for dinner?

462
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
Tuna surprise.

463
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,300
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

464
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,300
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

465
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

466
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,300
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

467
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,200
- They're all CID.
- Correction.

468
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,700
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

469
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

470
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,800
If they work for me, they need my okay.

471
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,000
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

472
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,200
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

473
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,300
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

474
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,400
- That bad?
- He quits or he drowns.

475
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,800
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

476
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,500
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

477
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

478
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,200
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

479
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
I heard.

480
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,400
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

481
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,500
Girl.

482
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,100
No! Kima, who cares?

483
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,300
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.

484
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,100
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

485
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,100
What would a lawyer say?

486
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,400
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

487
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,500
That's what I'm talking about.

488
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,700
- Get your ass down, fool.
- Fuck you, lady.

489
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,500
Ain't no lady.

490
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,400
- Bitch, drive it or lose it.
- Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

491
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,100
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

492
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs...

493
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

494
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,400
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

495
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
To perform at this level...

496
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,000
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

497
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,200
It is not instinct.

498
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
Come on upstairs.

499
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
All dogs have instinct.

500
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,900
Jesus Christ.

501
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,000
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

502
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
Who do we know at Fairfield?

503
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,400
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

504
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,600
What do they want with those for, anyway?

505
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Beats the fuck out of me.

506
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,400
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Fuck, man, shit.

507
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,600
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

508
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,200
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Clumsy, I guess.

509
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

510
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
and just clean yourself up.

511
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,300
You fucking goof.

512
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,300
Dick.

513
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,700
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

514
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,800
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

515
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,500
- I was out the damn door.
- You don't know Cheryl.

516
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,200
You don't know Marla.

517
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,000
If you want...

518
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,800
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

519
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,100
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

520
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,800
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

521
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,600
In the car, but not out in the open.

522
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
Yo, Rock.

523
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,700
Be subtle with it, man.

524
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,600
- You know what subtle means?
- Laid back and shit.

525
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,600
- Good tunes, Pop?
- Yeah.

526
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Thanks for the phones.

527
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,700
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

528
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
if you go rolling over rocks...

529
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,900
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

530
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

531
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,900
You got to give a working police his due.

532
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,600
- So, Bee's working for Lamar?
- All of them work for Lamar.

533
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
He got that whole corner to hisself.

534
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,300
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

535
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,700
In the second court.

536
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,300
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

537
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,900
How many doors down from the end?

538
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,100
Three.

539
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,200
Yo, Pops.

540
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

541
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,100
- Omar?
- Yeah, I need Omar.

542
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,100
What do you want with Omar?

543
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
Just want a word with him.

544
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,700
Just a word.

545
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,800
You want to get with Omar...

546
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,700
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

547
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,700
with a big-ass package.

548
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,200
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

549
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,200
You feel anything?

550
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,800
Let's go.

551
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,300
Come on.

552
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,600
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

553
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,000
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

554
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

555
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,000
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

556
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,700
We need the dope on the table.

557
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Of course you do.

558
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,900
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

559
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,800
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

560
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,500
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

561
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
"We are confident"?

562
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,100
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

563
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,900
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

564
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,300
But if we come up empty on this...

565
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
You won't.

566
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,000
Five will get you ten...

567
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,400
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

568
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,100
You have proof of this?

569
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,200
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

570
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,500
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

571
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,900
Lieutenant.

572
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,200
- Welcome to the southeast.
- Major, I understand you asked for me.

573
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,600
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

574
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,900
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

575
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,000
- You want to tell me about this target?
- Frank Sobotka.

576
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,400
A union man down at the port.

577
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,500
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

578
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,800
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

579
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,100
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

580
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,000
- You seen the off-site?
- Not yet.

581
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,400
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

582
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,300
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

583
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,300
It's from a young woman to her mother...

584
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,900
or at least an older woman.

585
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,200
She mention any names?

586
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
There is an Anya here.

587
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,800
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

588
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,500
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

589
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,800
- So who's she writing to?
- There is no name.

590
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,500
The letter is for the whole family.

591
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,600
But...

592
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,000
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

593
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,600
- Nadya.
- Is she in trouble?

594
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,900
She's dead.

595
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,800
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

596
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,300
If you had an envelope, I could...

597
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,500
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

598
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,500
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

599
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,900
- Father Vasyl, it says.
- There's no names or places or...

600
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,200
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

601
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,200
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

602
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,900
But leave the letter. I will try.

603
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,600
Thank you.

604
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,900
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

605
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,800
There's enough work.

606
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,800
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

607
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,700
from about a month ago.

608
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,500
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

609
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,200
Stop, Ash.

610
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,800
I was thinking...

611
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

612
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,200
You could cover that?

613
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
And maybe we don't rent.

614
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,300
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

615
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,100
Nothing too big, just...

616
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,200
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

617
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,300
has been fixed up real nice.

618
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,200
Like with wood floors and all.

619
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,700
Ash, what's that ship right there?

620
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,600
- Cable ship.
- And what's the gray one next to it?

621
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,200
Military Sealift.

622
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,500
Attagirl.

623
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,200
You cold?

624
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,400
- Dwight?
- What's up?

625
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,000
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

626
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,400
Search? What the fuck?

627
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,200
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

628
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,400
You got no call to be doing me like this.

629
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,700
- No call and no damn warrant.
- You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

630
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,900
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

631
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Where's the key, Dwight?

632
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

633
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,800
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

634
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,600
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

635
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,800
Here it be.

636
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,400
You all planted that shit.

637
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
You fucking know you did.

638
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,000
- What's with the whistle squad?
- It's for us.

639
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,600
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

640
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,900
- That's him.
- That's Horseface?

641
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,500
- How did he get the name?
- You need a close-up?

642
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,500
Thomas Pakusa.

643
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
We need to talk to you about something.

644
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,700
What?

645
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

646
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,300
If you say so.

647
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,500
You remember that container
that came off that day?

648
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,700
- With all the dead girls.
- No.

649
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,200
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

650
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,700
Come on, Horse.

651
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,000
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

652
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,600
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

653
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,400
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

654
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
No.

655
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Get the fuck in the car.

656
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,000
- Am I locked up?
- Get in the damn car.

657
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,200
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

658
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,100
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

659
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,700
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

660
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,700
Dad, what --

661
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,400
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

662
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,400
Say cheese.

663
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,400
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

664
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,700
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

665
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,200
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

666
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,700
All right.

667
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,200
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

668
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,600
Get your dick out of my computer!

669
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,700
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

670
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,100
Dead. To me, anyway.

671
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,700
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

672
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,500
What kept you?

673
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,300
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

674
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,200
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

675
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,200
- How's it hanging, Prez?
- How're you doing?

676
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,500
I'm all right.

677
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,000
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

678
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,600
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

679
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,100
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

680
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,300
Not McNulty though.

681
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,000
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

682
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,100
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

683
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,400
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

684
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,300
I'll leave you to it, then.

685
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,300
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

686
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,900
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

687
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,400
On what?

688
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,700
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

689
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,400
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

690
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,100
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

691
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,300
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

692
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,600
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

693
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,600
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

694
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,200
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

695
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,900
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

696
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,700
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped --

697
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,100
Jackpot.

698
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,200
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

699
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,300
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

700
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

701
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,900
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

702
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,200
Okay?

703
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,500
This is good, right here.

704
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,300
This is $10 right here.

705
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,900
Snitching Bubs.

706
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,200
You be asking for me?

707
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,600
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

708
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,300
- You hear the boys?
- No, it's quiet up there.

709
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,900
A little too quiet.

710
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,500
That means they're probably
playing video games.

711
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,500
Or with a book of matches.

712
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,000
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

713
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,900
I did.

714
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,900
- And?
- He says I shouldn't sign it.

715
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
Says I'm giving away too much.

716
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,900
I would never, under any circumstances...

717
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,800
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

718
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,300
That's what he says?

719
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,800
Signed and notarized.

720
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,000
I don't wanna argue about the money.

721
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
I wanna get back together.

722
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah.

723
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,000
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

724
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,300
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

725
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

726
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,400
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

727
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
a 10-year veteran.

728
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,100
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

729
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,500
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

730
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,800
to announce that the maximum penalties...

731
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,400
will be sought against this officer...

732
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,900
I got a midterm. I got to study.

733
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,700
- So this is their joint?
- What's the plan?

734
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,000
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

735
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,500
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

736
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,800
I hate that country shit.

737
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,100
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

738
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,700
No, sir.

739
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,400
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

740
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,400
Left tackle.

741
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,000
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

742
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

743
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,800
Darling.

744
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,500
What's the deal?

745
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,300
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

746
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,400
How about you?

747
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,500
I'm leaving after this one.

748
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,000
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

749
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,100
- City Homicide.
- Homicide?

750
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,100
- Who got killed?
- Those dead girls in the can.

751
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,400
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

752
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,800
That's what I heard, anyway.

753
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,900
Excuse me.
