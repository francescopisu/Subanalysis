1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,100
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,200
Elena, you gotta talk to me.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,900
Last call.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,500
Why is she such a pain in the ass?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,700
- Excuse me.
- Hey, pal.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
It's all right. One more, please.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,200
- Save some for the other customers, okay?
- Pour it!

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,600
- You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
- There's a cab picking me up.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
Bite me.

11
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah, coffee.

12
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,900
- What's with the hand?
- Just a scratch.

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,100
Get me some eggs, will you?

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,600
- Can I get a scrapple with that?
- You can get anything you want.

15
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,700
Oh, God!

16
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,100
Look at him, all high and mighty.

17
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,600
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?

18
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,000
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.

19
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,100
He's built kind of solid, though.

20
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.

21
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,900
- You think?
- His ass is candy, Zig.

22
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,700
You, you're the legend of the docks.

23
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,100
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.

24
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.

25
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
So either we bring in a hell of a case...

26
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,400
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.

27
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,800
That sounded a little desperate.

28
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,000
Not entirely.

29
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,600
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.

30
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,500
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

31
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Come take a look at this.

32
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,700
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...

33
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,900
where we tracked the suspect container.

34
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,500
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...

35
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...

36
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
among other traffickers on the East Side.

37
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.

38
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...

39
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...

40
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
that we've already
made controlled buys from.

41
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.

42
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,300
- What's your PC on the truck driver?
- Sergei Malatov:

43
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,500
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,700
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.

45
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,900
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.

46
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,700
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...

47
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,200
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cellphone.

48
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
Checking the DNR log's history...

49
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,500
we matched seven other calls
from that cellphone...

50
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,800
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.

51
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,700
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?

53
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
On a CI's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...

54
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,900
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...

55
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

56
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,600
When we ran that phone number
from that address...

57
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,400
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.

58
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,700
But when we checked it against
the cellphone of our friend, Sergei...

59
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,400
- We got a couple of hits.
- Sobotka's your stated target, right?

60
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,800
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...

61
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

62
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,200
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.

63
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,100
- No offense to Stan Valchek.
- Okay.

64
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,700
I admit, you've got PC.

65
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cellphone, too.

66
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Now what have you got for exhaustion?

67
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,200
Any possible informants?

68
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,100
- Nothing on the docks.
- No one we can buy weight with.

69
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
- Surveillance?
- That got us to the front door...

70
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,200
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

71
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,700
Start typing. I'll call the judge.

72
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,300
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.

73
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,300
- I hear Charles lost his leg.
- What?

74
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,500
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?

75
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.

76
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.

77
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,700
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.

78
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Banana, too.

79
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
Fucking shit!

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
- Take us up.
- Son of a bitch! God damn it!

81
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,100
Fuck you!

82
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,100
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.

83
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,100
You're the fucking wimp.

84
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
No, fuck you, Maui!

85
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,600
- Stay there.
- Fuck you!

86
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
God damn it!

87
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,200
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.

88
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,000
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!

89
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Shit.

90
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
- What the hell are you wearing?
- No one mentioned all the perks.

91
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,000
Lacrosse?

92
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,800
What, a brother can't run with a stick?

93
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,300
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.

94
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,700
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?

95
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Lester, I'm just saying...

96
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
I thought you were born in pinstripes.

97
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,100
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...

98
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,100
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...

99
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
lost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...

100
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,000
a veteran police of means and talent...

101
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

102
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,700
Up to a point.

103
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,500
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

104
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,000
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.

105
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Take that one over there.

106
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm homesick already.

107
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,900
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.

108
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,300
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.

109
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Fucking Ziggy.

110
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,100
- What are you looking for?
- Can't find the fucking bills.

111
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,600
- End of the month, everything's hanging.
- We got anything for the Greeks?

112
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,200
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

113
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.

114
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,700
Let me ask you something important.

115
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
You like fake tits? I can't decide.

116
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,900
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.

117
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,000
I thought I knew what paperwork was.

118
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,400
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls...

119
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,800
You all cannot spell for shit.

120
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Would we be police if we could?

121
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,300
- Who's the duty judge this week?
- Vanderwal.

122
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
You think he'll sign?

123
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,700
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.

124
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,700
Fucking Vanderwal.

125
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
Wash windows?

126
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,000
- Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
- Yes, Your Honor.

127
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...

128
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?

129
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes, Your Honor.

130
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Absolutely.

131
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,900
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

132
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Sash installation.

133
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
And then if you can give
the windows a wash... Thank you.

134
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,900
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.

135
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,300
- Fuck, my knee.
- Sorry.

136
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
- First name?
- First name: Francis.

137
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
Spell the last name on the account.

138
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

139
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.

140
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,100
- You've been flagged.
- Flagged?

141
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,900
It says right here on the computer.

142
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,800
Yeah? You're kidding me.

143
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't have any more information
on that now.

144
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Whatever, okay.

145
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.

146
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,700
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?

147
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,100
No phone.

148
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cellphone,
but they let me go...

149
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
even before I mail the check in.

150
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,300
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?

151
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
- I've been flagged.
- Flagged?

152
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:

153
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,900
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,400
"Flagged, " what the fuck is that?
What am I, special?

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,700
Maybe you been touched by an angel.

156
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,300
Told you, B.

157
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.

158
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,400
- Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
- No, that ain't it, man.

159
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.

160
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Damn.

161
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,800
- Pud, how we doing?
- Slow as a white man in slippers.

162
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
All right, later.

163
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,500
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.

164
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,500
It's that bullshit, man.

165
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
You two got a reason to be here?

166
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,400
- We're just going about our business.
- Keep moving.

167
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,400
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?

168
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,700
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.

169
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
Shit is fucked up, man.

170
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
Damn, junior, you had a night.

171
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,000
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself --

172
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
Drop it.

173
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,600
What is wrong with you, man?

174
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,600
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...

175
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?

176
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,800
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.

177
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
Come and get me.

178
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?

179
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,300
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.

180
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800
You jealous, bitch?

181
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,700
I'd rather be back in Homicide.

182
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,000
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.

183
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Why?

184
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,800
- That floater showing up in your dreams?
- No, it's not just her.

185
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,600
I mean, who am I, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.

186
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,400
I need to do a case.

187
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
I mean, if I'm not gonna...

188
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,400
If I'm no good for...

189
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,700
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.

190
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,900
- He'll put you on this straightaway.
- Yeah, why wouldn't he?

191
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,700
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...

192
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,500
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.

193
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,900
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.

194
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Where is it now?

195
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,300
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

196
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,500
How's that for your kid brother?

197
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,500
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

198
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,900
Just this.

199
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,900
Read it.

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,100
- What is it?
- A confirmation letter, like.

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,900
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?

202
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,300
I put you up for it. You're on.

203
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm on?

204
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,300
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?

205
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,900
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

206
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,900
You mean, you greased it.

207
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.

208
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,800
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.

209
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,900
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

210
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,900
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.

211
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.

212
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,900
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.

213
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
That's not for me.

214
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
What's for you?

215
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,100
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.

216
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.

217
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,300
Whatever I got comes straight.

218
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,200
That's real noble, big brother.

219
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Not noble. Right.

220
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,000
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?

221
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
The only difference between me and you...

222
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,200
- Is you picked the wrong union.
- That ain't the only difference.

223
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,900
- If you were in my position --
- I'm not.

224
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,000
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.

225
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,200
Come on, kid.

226
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Sit down.

227
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,100
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?

228
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
We all did back then.

229
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.

230
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.

231
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.

232
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,100
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...

233
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,100
when he was in the bag.

234
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,600
How come they don't fly away?

235
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,300
His wings are clipped.

236
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,100
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?

237
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.

238
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,300
Them things got lice.

239
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.

240
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,600
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

241
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,900
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.

242
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,300
- With reasons.
- But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.

243
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,600
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.

244
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
- But good police.
- Always.

245
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...

246
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,800
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...

247
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,700
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.

248
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And when he is policing...

249
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,500
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.

250
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,200
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.

251
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,700
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.

252
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Go back to Rawls.

253
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
So I get paid?

254
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.

255
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,100
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?

256
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential Informant Number 238...

257
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,400
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.

258
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,400
- So you're gonna send my picture --
- And your social security number.

259
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,400
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.

260
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?

261
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Did you?

262
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,900
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,100
We brought back
very significant information...

264
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.

265
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.

266
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?

267
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,100
10%.

268
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,500
10% goes to me and I don't tell.

269
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,700
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.

270
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,100
- That's why you don't tell.
- We're not even gonna use your real name.

271
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

272
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,800
10%.

273
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,700
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

274
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,100
It's payday, Zig. Once again.

275
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
All that?

276
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,000
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.

277
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
Nice sled you got.

278
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.

279
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,100
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?

280
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,900
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.

281
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.

282
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

283
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,700
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

284
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,900
Worry about yourself.

285
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I heard you took on Maui.

286
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,900
- Boy needed to get schooled.
- What are you, some kind of badass now?

287
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,300
- Yeah, it's me.
- Niko, things okay?

288
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,900
- Things are going great.
- If you need more, talk to Sergei.

289
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,500
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?

290
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,900
Is that the man?

291
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,200
- You don't have to concern yourself --
- I wanna meet him.

292
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,900
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?

293
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.

294
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,000
- Take the money, Zig.
- You don't think I can do it?

295
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,500
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.

296
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,300
- I don't want it. You pick it up.
- You.

297
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
Fuck you.

298
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,700
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?

299
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
- How many you ordered?
- That'd be three.

300
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Your order's in.

301
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,700
- Yes?
- It's Nick.

302
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,200
How's it going?

303
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,600
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
You just say where and when.

304
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,400
I'll call you back.

305
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,800
- Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
- This ain't West Baltimore.

306
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.

307
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,300
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.

308
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,300
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.

309
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,300
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.

310
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,100
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?

311
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,400
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.

312
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,400
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire -
in-the-belly garbage, either.

313
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,100
The answer is no.

314
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,600
What I need from you, I get.

315
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,800
- No bullshit, no arguments.
- What?

316
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,100
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?

317
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,600
I need McNulty on this detail.

318
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,700
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...

319
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,800
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.

320
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
You want me to clear those bodies?

321
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,300
See that you do.

322
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,100
Who they?

323
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,100
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...

324
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

325
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
This far over?

326
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
I know one thing, though.

327
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
- What?
- They're serving our customers.

328
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
- Marine unit, Diggins.
- I'm looking for McNulty.

329
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,000
McNulty, for you.

330
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
It's Daniels...

331
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
Get back to your office.

332
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,100
Thanks, Lieutenant.

333
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,900
This new generation with the names...

334
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
$150? Jesus.

335
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,800
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

336
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,900
This is the other half of the case, right here.

337
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,500
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, Inc...

338
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,900
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.

339
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?

340
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,900
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.

341
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
A building this nice is for the johns.

342
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,400
- Makes them feel safer.
- How do they bring them in? The lobby?

343
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,800
- Garage, probably.
- Either they have a garage card...

344
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,100
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.

345
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,400
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...

346
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...

347
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.

348
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Tickle the wire like that.

349
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Exactly.

350
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,700
Pleasure boats, topless women.

351
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.

352
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Thanks.

353
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,600
- We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
- And the day before that.

354
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,500
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?

355
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,700
We up, but we ain't in it.

356
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,000
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so...

357
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.

358
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,500
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.

359
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,400
How you gonna act like that?

360
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,800
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so...

361
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?

362
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,000
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.

364
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,800
Separate your ass.

365
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,000
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...

366
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,800
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.

367
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,700
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...

368
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,100
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

369
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.

370
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,100
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

371
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,700
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

372
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,500
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.

373
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,300
- Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
- Same for me.

374
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,400
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...

375
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
if she even heard tell of it.

376
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,500
What?

377
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,100
Takes a whore to catch a whore.

378
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,100
What the fuck did I do?

379
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.

380
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,200
I say, look at this.

381
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,100
Dolores, is that you?

382
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,400
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.

383
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...

384
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,400
but he can. So, if you will...

385
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,100
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.

386
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,100
- Tell me he's a fake.
- That'd be lying, hon.

387
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,100
Is they real diamonds around its neck?

388
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,500
You sick, boy. You just sick.

389
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,900
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...

390
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,400
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?

391
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,300
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.

392
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,200
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.

393
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,600
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.

394
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Easy, there.

395
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,600
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.

396
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,200
He needs a chaser.

397
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Put it on my tab, Dolores.

398
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,900
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.

399
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,800
That look right to you?

400
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,100
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.

401
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
What about the passenger?

402
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,500
Looks the part to me.

403
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,400
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.

404
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,400
Our man Horseface on it?

405
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,900
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.

406
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,500
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.

407
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,100
There goes the shuttle.

408
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,500
What's he waiting on?

409
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.

410
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,600
Lying to the wife's easy.

411
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,100
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.

412
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,300
Police!

413
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,600
Let's see your license.

414
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,900
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?

415
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,800
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?

416
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,000
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.

417
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,000
How does he go about it?

418
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
He'd dial that phone number.

419
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,100
Dial the number. What else?

420
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Punch in those four numbers there.

421
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,000
- And?
- Ask for Eve.

422
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
- What?
- Ask for Eve.

423
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
Go on, go home.

424
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,200
Godspeed, Bob.

425
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,400
- Johnson.
- My ticket to the dance.

426
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
Here we go. We got one.

427
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,000
12-14, Kima.

428
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,600
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

429
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,800
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.

430
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,600
- Raise our boys.
- Right.

431
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,400
- What's Kima rolling as?
- Gas and electric.

432
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,700
- Yes?
- Everything's good.

433
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,200
- You coming in now?
- Yes.

434
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.

435
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,600
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...

436
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,900
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.

437
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,000
- Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
- Copy.

438
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.

439
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,600
The van has too much profile on it
right now.

440
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Copy that, too. We're up.

441
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,300
- Broken seal?
- Hey, Frank.

442
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
What's missing?

443
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,600
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

444
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,800
- Diapers?
- Disposables, yeah.

445
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,300
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?

446
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm not so sure.

447
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,400
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.

448
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,000
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?

449
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,800
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.

450
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,600
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.

451
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,300
- Yeah?
- She's detailed.

452
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
Something to do with city police.

453
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,900
All right, we're up.

454
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm out. You have the eyeball.

455
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,900
12-08, copy that.

456
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,200
First I got this thing on my phone bill.

457
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,300
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.

458
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,800
You're paranoid, Frank.

459
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,300
- Why would she lie?
- Shit if I know.

460
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,400
- The Greek has two today, right?
- Boris comes back in an hour.

461
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,400
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.

462
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?

463
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,900
Enter it on the computer, like any other.

464
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,600
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.

465
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,000
You want me to lose a clean can?

466
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,600
- And give it to the Russian, yeah.
- You gonna tell them?

467
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,700
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.

468
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.

469
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,100
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.

470
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,600
I know.

471
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
We got something here.

472
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,000
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

473
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,400
They're running them out in tandem.

474
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
- That means "one after the other, " Jimmy.
- I know what it means.

475
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
12-08.

476
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,800
Carver, what's the status of your truck?

477
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,400
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.

478
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,800
- You want us on the truck or the can?
- The can.

479
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,100
Copy.

480
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
- I got no eyes at the port.
- Kima?

481
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
- She pulled up.
- I got it.

482
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,600
But the truck already left. You won't make it.

483
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,200
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.

484
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,400
Do it. You're still here?

485
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,000
Good call.

486
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,600
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.

487
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
- You stop for 24 mph?
- License and registration.

488
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,100
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

489
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

490
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,000
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.

491
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,200
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.

492
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,700
Not on the phone, Frank.

493
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,700
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.

494
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,700
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

495
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,700
Go ahead, open it.

496
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,000
Bobbie Dolls.

497
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,000
What the fuck is this bullshit?

498
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,000
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.

499
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,800
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.

500
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,800
Are they thieves or are they stupid?

501
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,200
He's dialing the same number.

502
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
It came, but it's nothing.

503
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,400
It's bullshit.

504
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,800
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.

505
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,900
Get rid of it where?

506
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Drop it in the fucking street.

507
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,200
- This is sweet.
- The boss man.

508
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
And we're on him.

509
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,000
- 7 a.m.?
- Man, what the fuck do you think?

510
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,600
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.

511
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,000
Shit is early.

512
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,000
Y'all down for this?

513
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,700
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.

514
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,300
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.

515
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,900
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.

516
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,800
- Hey, Poot.
- Yo, Poot.

517
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
Come on, man.

518
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,400
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.

519
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,800
A nigger can't look at a female?

520
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,500
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.

521
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,500
- At least I be getting some.
- Well, I be getting some, too.

522
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
But I don't make it my everything.

523
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Lieutenant, you still up?

524
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,300
I'm here.

525
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,300
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

526
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,700
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.

527
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,700
Now he's dumping it.

528
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
10-4. Come home.

529
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,200
- You don't wanna sit on the can?
- Negative. The can is clean.

530
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
I don't know, Uncle Frank.

531
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,100
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.

532
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,400
Maybe.

533
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,400
You called Spiros still, right?

534
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,700
Spiros will know what to do.

535
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,500
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.

536
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,900
All right.

537
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,900
I can't keep up with him.

538
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,800
What's with the duck?

539
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,500
Ziggy.

540
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,000
Is Daniels around?

541
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,800
- No.
- What's the deal with can number two?

542
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
No contraband.

543
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,800
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.

544
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,800
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.

545
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,500
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?

546
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.

547
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,300
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.

548
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,900
- But more than one, I get sleepy.
- Yeah, me, too.

549
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,400
- What, you short a car?
- Need new brake pads.

550
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,700
Two. Boys.

551
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,200
How about you?

552
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,600
Boy and a girl.

553
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,600
And your husband, he...

554
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,000
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?

555
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,300
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?

556
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,100
I was just asking.

557
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,100
He left me.

558
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,200
Left us.

559
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,500
Picked up, moved south.

560
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Said it was either my job or him.

561
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,100
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

562
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,800
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.

563
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,600
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.

564
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,700
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?

565
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,800
She died.

566
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,400
- Not now, Gus. I'm good.
- Whatever you say, Jimmy.

567
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,000
So, you about ready to go?

568
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,300
- Sure.
- Be right back. I just gotta make a call.

569
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,900
Please enter your code now.

570
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,300
- Hi, may I help you?
- Yeah, let me talk to Eve.

571
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,500
- This is Eve.
- I'm looking to connect.

572
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,100
Would you like a date tonight?

573
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,700
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.

574
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,000
- Have you been entertained by us before?
- No, first time for me.

575
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,800
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.

576
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,400
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

577
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,000
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.

578
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,200
When are you thinking of coming?

579
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,300
Just give me a minute.

580
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,500
Stop! Move away from the cookie jar.

581
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,700
Long day.

582
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,700
Yeah, me, too.

583
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,100
Thanks for the beer.

584
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,200
Goodbye.

585
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Hey, y'all, they coming.

586
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,900
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?

587
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,000
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.

588
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,900
- You're standing on my real estate.
- Mine now.

589
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,700
- Took it while you was resting.
- Y'all too late.

590
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,500
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.

591
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,500
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?

592
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,500
- You gonna see me in your sleep.
- Yeah, I know.

593
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,400
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.

594
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,100
They gonna come back.

595
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,300
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.

596
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,500
- Where is he?
- You can talk to me, Frank.

597
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,500
- This is bigger than you.
- I'll tell him what you say.

598
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,500
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.

599
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,800
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.

600
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,400
Have a seat.

601
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,800
A long time since we talk, Frank.

602
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,900
- Coffee, something?
- We're good.

603
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,500
What's on your mind?

604
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,600
Every goddamn thing.

605
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,900
For one,
I think my cellphone's being tapped.

606
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,600
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.

607
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,300
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...

608
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,600
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.

609
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,100
- So you switched the can.
- I ran a test.

610
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,800
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

611
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,600
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...

612
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,800
right after he picked it up.

613
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,500
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.

614
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Very smart.

615
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,900
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

616
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,600
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.

617
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,800
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

618
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,900
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.

619
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,600
Our cut stays the same though, right?

620
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,400
You kidding?

621
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,400
What's your name?

622
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,500
- Nick.
- Sobotka.

623
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,000
That's a fair question, Niko.

624
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,800
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.

625
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,100
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.

626
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,700
- That's work, isn't it?
- We take gas, so do you.

627
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,000
- You don't understand --
- I understand completely.

628
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,200
No one is in this for love.

629
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,400
It ain't just the money.

630
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,400
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!

631
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,500
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!

632
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,700
Okay. We pay you still.

633
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,900
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...

634
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,700
and I want you should be happy.

635
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,600
Thanks.

636
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,900
It's a new world, Frank.

637
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,300
You should go out
and spend some of the money...

638
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,500
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.

639
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,300
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
