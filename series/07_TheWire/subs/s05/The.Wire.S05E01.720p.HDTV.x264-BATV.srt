1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,699
You see now,
I'm here to tell you,

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,700
this remaining silent shit
ain't nothing like they make it out to be.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
You up in here all tight with it,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,900
waiting for your paid lawyer,

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,700
thinking you all wise, ain't you?

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,300
No, see...

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,500
that work when you some kind
of criminal mastermind...

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,000
when you ain't been seen
runnin' from the deed.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,100
When your own fuckin' running partner
ain't in the next room,

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
putting you in.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,800
Yep.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,100
He's telling it like a little bitch.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,700
We even went to Mickey D's for him
because he was so motherfucking helpful.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Two quarter pounders, big fries,

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,900
McDonaldland cookies, Dr. Pepper.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's how your boy roll, right?

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,600
All right. Step out.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,700
Where we going?

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,700
Break room.
So you can enjoy that, huh?

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,400
- All right. But I still ain't sayin' shit to you.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,600
Marnell, what the fuck?

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,400
How many years you figure
we've been doing the same shit?

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
20, at least.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
True.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,000
True.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,400
False. Load them up.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
- So, this shit actually works.
- Hell yeah.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Americans are stupid people.
We believe what we're told.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
All right.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
So, it can feel my heartbeat?

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,000
Pulse, yeah.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
If Marnell say I had the gun, he lying.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
The machine tells the tale, son.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,100
Are we ready, Professor?

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,300
- Yeah.
- We'll start with an easy one.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
Is your name, in fact,
Dashawn Fredericks?

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Yeah.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
True.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,000
And do you reside, in fact,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,800
the 1200 block of Woodyear Street
in West Baltimore?

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,300
Yeah.

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
- True.
- And did you and Marnell

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,500
shoot your boy Pookie down on Cary Street
just like Marnell said you did?

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,900
No. No.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,700
Lie. You lying motherfucker.

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,800
Machine is never wrong, son.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Fuck, man!

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Nigger can't never
keep his damn mouth shut.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
I should've busted a cap
in Pookie ass my own self.

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,400
Left Marnell home and shit.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,700
He just a bitch, is all.

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,900
The bigger the lie,

54
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,200
the more they believe.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,700
Where's the BlackBerry?

56
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,900
He brought his tunes.

57
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,800
All the running shit pay, don't it?

58
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,900
We got one coming in. Unidentified
number-one male. Got him, Jimmy?

59
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah. More face-to-face.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Oh, man.

61
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, this would be more fun
if we were actually getting paid.

62
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,200
Hey, you know, I heard a story about you,
when I was back in the West.

63
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
- It's not true.
- I haven't even told it yet.

64
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
Whatever it is, it's not true.

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
You were on a vice undercover one time,

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
and instead of pulling up,
you went ahead and closed the deal.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
I read this report where
you got blowed by this whore,

68
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,300
and you actually wrote it
that you got blowed.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
You believe everything you read?

70
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,500
Look, man, all I'm saying,

71
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,900
if I'm gonna take your package,
split me and be fair.

72
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,200
I got to pay all my people the same
and you upping the price on me.

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,500
Pay your people less.

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
They my people, though.

75
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Show it yourself.

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Split it 60/40.

77
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,500
You want better?
You need to tool up.

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,900
I'll wait for Chris, Snoop,
and the rest of my people call on your people.

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,400
We will be brief
with all you motherfuckers.

80
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,900
I think you know.

81
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
All right.

82
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
Northbound on Fulton.

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Lester, coming your way.

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,000
- I see him.
- Roger that.

85
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,800
Every day, same shit.

86
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,100
- Look at this pretty bitch.
- Ten-hut!

87
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,900
Just sit the fuck down.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,300
I'm not gonna pretend to be insulted because
you all are pretending to respect the rank.

89
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Today, he's an SIC.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,300
Tomorrow, he might be
a newly minted lieutenant.

91
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,200
You never know with these
career-minded motherfuckers.

92
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,300
If I was minding my career,
would I be in the Western

93
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,700
in command of you useless fucking humps?

94
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,700
OK, let's go to the readouts
and the warrants first.

95
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,300
- Fuck the readouts.
- Fuck the warrants.

96
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
What the fuck is going on with our hours?

97
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Yeah.

98
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,700
Easy, easy. If I had an answer,
you'd have an answer.

99
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm in the same boat as you.

100
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,400
It's five weeks since I've seen
overtime or court pay,

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,100
and I gotta pay the credit union,

102
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,500
the archdiocese for my kid's tuition

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,400
and my ex-wife so she can pay
her cunt of an attorney...

104
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Shut the fuck up
and sit the fuck down!

105
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,500
In your fucking seats.

106
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
We're still authorizing overtime and the
state's attorneys are still signing court slips.

107
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
But you ain't fucking paying us.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
The union says we're going down
to the NLRB and deal with this shit.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Word coming down is that
when the city's budget situation is improved,

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,900
we'll all see that as back pay or comp time.

111
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,100
- Every last hour.
- Back pay my ass.

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
This shit here is just paper.

113
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,500
65 hours of worthless paper right here.

114
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,400
Officer Brown, sit your ass.

115
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Sit!

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
We're all professionals.

117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,300
And we're about to police the roughest district
in one of the roughest cities in the world.

118
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Show some pride.

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If promises were made,
promises will be kept.

120
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
The situation in the city
right now is bad

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
but it won't stay bad forever.

122
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,500
We wait this out like professionals.

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,800
Now, then,
back to the readouts.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
First item is from motor pool.

125
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,600
No marked or unmarked units can be shopped
on Dickman Street until further notice.

126
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,800
What?

127
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Cutbacks and fleet budgeting
require that all districts

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
make do with vehicles in their
current state of repairs. That means...

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Shitbox cars are falling apart,
don't they fucking know that?

130
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,400
Where you at?

131
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,100
On his ass.

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,100
- You guys got the eyeball.
- All good, Lester. It's all good.

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,700
Natives are restless, huh?

134
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,600
I don't know how long we go
before the wheels fall off the cart.

135
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,500
A year ago, they were promised
pay raises, pension bumps,

136
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300
better equipment, better cars.

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,900
Now we can't even pay the OT.

138
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Gave them the professionalism bit, right?

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
In the real world, they pay professionals.
That's why we call them pros.

140
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Major, there's a problem on the back lot.

141
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
- If it really bothers you, clean them up.
- Fuck you.

142
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Fuck you right back.

143
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,300
That thing was all fucked up
when I got it for midnight, ask anyone.

144
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,100
You clean it or you get
the midnight shift to clean it.

145
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,800
Clean this.

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
Fuck you, Gene.
You don't leave it like that for the next man.

147
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,900
You're the one whining
like a little bitch, Bobby.

148
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
As SIC should I stop this?

149
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,100
What, you think this is
good for morale or something?

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
These guys haven't had
an honest paycheck in weeks.

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,700
We have no fucking morale, Sergeant.

152
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,900
Kid ran us around for half an hour.

153
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,000
Amazing, ain't it?

154
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,100
Here we go.

155
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,700
Got a meeting.

156
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
- Want me to come?
- No, no.

157
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
You go check on your corner.
I'll send word if it's on.

158
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,300
- He's moving.
- All right.

159
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Lester, are you there?

160
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
Up on Reisterstown with Chris.

161
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Marlo's on the move.

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Should we follow him?

163
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Why? We know where he's going.

164
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,800
No, sir, we've cut it to the bone already.

165
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,400
The cars are gonna go in service
for the next month.

166
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,000
And for as long as we can get away with it,
we're deferring all overtime and court pay.

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
How's crime?
How are your stats?

168
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,300
The double-digit decline you wanted,
not possible with these cuts.

169
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400
For God's sake, you got to
show us some kind of reduction.

170
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,100
- I campaigned on that.
- All this deferred overtime...

171
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,700
We'll pay it as we can.
And the pay raises I promised?

172
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,200
They're still coming, just a year late.

173
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,400
I got to throw every dollar at the schools,

174
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,200
but you tell your people
I know I made promises.

175
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Where else can you guys trim?

176
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,700
Well, we've been running
a prolonged investigation...

177
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,800
into all the bodies
we pulled out of those houses last year.

178
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Months of surveillance.
Thousands of man-hours.

179
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,300
At this point,
we're not close to an arrest.

180
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,500
You're saying you want us
to come down on a case

181
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,100
in which 22 people were murdered
and left to rot in city houses?

182
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,600
We caught national news coverage
on those murders.

183
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Last year.

184
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,700
I don't want anyone saying
we're giving up on those murders.

185
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
I don't want to see that headline.

186
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,700
But given our fiscal situation, we could...

187
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,700
temporarily suspend the investigation...

188
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,200
pending new developments.

189
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,600
Anything else?

190
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,200
We need to take away the ten-hour cap
on secondary employment.

191
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,600
You do that and your police
aren't doing police work.

192
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,200
They're guarding liquor stores,
bouncing nightclubs, putting up drywall.

193
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,700
Respectfully, morale is at rock bottom.

194
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
You need to throw our people a bone...

195
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,500
or you could lose them for good.

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
Hold the line now

197
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,700
and we'll get to a better place,
I promise.

198
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
Say it, Norman,

199
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,200
you're thinking it.

200
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,600
Truth to power, Norman.

201
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Isn't that what
I keep you around for?

202
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,500
When the governor threw that
50-some million on the table,

203
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,900
you should've picked that shit up.

204
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,400
He takes the state bail-out
and he never becomes governor.

205
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,100
He shorts the police department,
the crime rate stays up,

206
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,600
he ain't no governor, neither.

207
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,700
Just a weak-ass mayor
of a broke-ass city.

208
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
- Feel better?
- A little bit.

209
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,700
You?

210
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Boy folded it up.

211
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
He taking our shit 60/40.

212
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Yeah, nigger showed no heart at all.

213
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
- So my people could stand down there?
- Definitely.

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,200
- All right.
- Won't need no drama behind this nonsense.

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,300
And po-po's still up on you, huh?

216
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah, hot all the time, man.

217
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Today they got the white boy with the black
hair up on the roof with Booker T Washington.

218
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Watching with his spyglass.

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,700
The young'un
saw him climbing up. Yeah.

220
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,200
All right, so we'll do like this, then.

221
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
That's it.

222
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
All of that so he could swap a few words.

223
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
How do you wiretap that?

224
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800
- Lester?
- Are we done for the day, man?

225
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
You don't want to stay on Chris,
see where he goes next?

226
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,600
We've been on this guy for months, man,
he doesn't slip.

227
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,200
And no one's kicking our OT.

228
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Yeah. We're done.

229
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,200
Copy that.

230
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Greenhouse gas right here. Gas up.

231
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,500
Hey, Marcus,
you got a count for me?

232
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
- Spider, you got a count for me?
- For you? No.

233
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,100
How we do?

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Can't say for sure.

235
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,600
They short, huh?

236
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Man, I just know they ain't told me.

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,700
Greenhouse gas. Gas up on the green.

238
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,200
Go home, man.
Bug'll be out of school pretty soon.

239
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,500
I ain't you, Michael.

240
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Go get Bug. I'll see you tonight.

241
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,200
Greenhouse gas right here.

242
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Yo, we short?

243
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,700
No, we good. Got 60 left from 1,400.
We on it, Mike.

244
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,500
So why you ain't tell Duke?

245
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,300
- Why you fucking with Duke, nigger?
- I ain't fucking with nobody, man.

246
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300
He just acting like a bitch, that's all.

247
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Greenhouse gas is hot.

248
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,600
They're getting a little sloppier.

249
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,400
Did that meet in the same lot
they've used twice in the last week.

250
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,100
The one in McCulloh?

251
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,600
That's pretty thin considering how long
we've been on these guys, Lester.

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
They're gonna get lazy, fall into a pattern.

253
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,800
They all do, over time.

254
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,100
Someone say overtime?

255
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,800
We did 14 hours today
and we'll only get paid for 8.

256
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Cases gotta go green
before they go black.

257
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,800
That's how I was taught.

258
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,300
180 hours and counting.

259
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Couple more weeks
and you get a month's work.

260
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,300
Couple more weeks, I'm gonna be in jail
for late payment of child support.

261
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
Who needs a taste?

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Shit. Who's buying, motherfucker?

263
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll cover a round or two.

264
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,300
Then I guess I'm drinking a round or two.

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
Oh, yeah, and a boat dock, huh?

266
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,700
Yeah. And the gazebo here... for my wife.

267
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
You get any word from downtown on
when they'll start paying out the OT again?

268
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,100
Cos we going double shift
on these surveillances.

269
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
They haven't told me anything.

270
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,300
Guess I ain't in the loop.

271
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,800
We have to shut it down, Colonel.

272
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,500
Explain to me how we come up
on 22 bodies. Explain that to me.

273
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,300
This comes straight from the hall.

274
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
You're talking about a year's worth of work
by my best people.

275
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
To just give up on all of that?

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,300
Colonel, we haven't made
an honest payroll in over a month.

277
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
Where the fuck is Carcetti?

278
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,200
The man promised us a new day.

279
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
He's tangled up with the schools
and we're on hold.

280
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,300
The mayor's made a few
commitments to me personally.

281
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,300
If you want to call in a marker
on behalf of this department, feel free.

282
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,500
And while you're at it, see if you can
get your take-home car back.

283
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Budget officer called an hour ago

284
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,000
telling us to relieve colonels and below
of take-home vehicles.

285
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,400
Hold on. See, if you move it here,
then I got you.

286
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,200
OK. The little man bringing it.

287
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,900
Yo, Duke...

288
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I've been thinking.

289
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,500
You ain't need to put in time
on the corner if you don't want.

290
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,100
I mean, you doing enough here
with Bug to get paid.

291
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,700
How you mean?

292
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm saying, looking out for him.

293
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,600
And I've been thinking, like,
if you were to get locked up

294
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,200
for some shit,
how'd it be for Bug, you know?

295
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,200
So, who's gonna watch
your corner in the morning?

296
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,500
Thought I might promote Spider,

297
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,000
see how he do for a week or so.

298
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
So, I'd be like a nanny and shit?

299
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
What am I gonna do before
Bug get home from school,

300
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,300
clean the stove and bake some cookies?

301
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Do what you wanna, yo.

302
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,100
Before he get home, time is your own.

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
You beat me.

304
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Oh, snap, you beat me.

305
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,500
Fucking liars,
motherfucking liars.

306
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,800
Easy, boy.

307
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,000
I was happy on patrol. I was fine.

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,500
- You were bored.
- Fuck no. I was happy.

309
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Motherfuckers come to me and say,

310
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,300
"It's a new day, Jimmy,"

311
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,900
talking shit about how it was gonna change.
Shit never fucking changes.

312
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,000
If they had left me up and running
when Marlo was on them cell phones,

313
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,400
I'd have had him a year ago.

314
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,500
See? But they can't do the right thing.
It ain't in them.

315
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Now we're back on Marlo's ass,
we need to be on him 24/7.

316
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,900
The motherfuckers cut our overtime
and they shopped our best surveillance van.

317
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,100
Don't even think
about trying to requisition

318
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,300
a new fucking digital camera.

319
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,800
They want to do it on the cheap.

320
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,100
- Bunk on the prowl.
- Hey, Bunky-Bunk, come here.

321
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,700
- Jimmy.
- Come here, you virile beast.

322
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
Come on, Bunk.
Buy me a drink, you whore.

323
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
With what?

324
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,100
I'd have thought the bosses
would've at least figured out

325
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,000
how to keep paying Homicide.

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,600
Pete, come on.
Take these slips off me.

327
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll pay you 50 cents
on the dollar against my tab.

328
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,900
- Cash only.
- When we get paid, you double your money.

329
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,100
City's never gonna be healthy enough
to go all that back pay.

330
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,400
How the fuck are we gonna
pay the bar tab?

331
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,600
We could always
knock off a liquor store.

332
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,300
G & L on Edmondson.
Thin Plexi, I'd take out the counter man.

333
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,100
- I'll cover you.
- I got the door, no problem.

334
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,700
Who's gonna be our wheel man?

335
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Every plan, a weak link.

336
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I heard they're closing the foreign bureaus -
Jo'burg, Beijing, everything.

337
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
- I heard layoffs as bad as in Philly.
- Bullshit, they're not gonna lay off.

338
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,900
They'll offer buyouts first.

339
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,600
If they don't get enough,
they'll go right to layoffs.

340
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,300
What the fuck you care?
You got all the seniority in the world.

341
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,400
Be a shame to rid of them twenty somethings
in the newsroom.

342
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,100
Degenerate motherfucker.

343
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah. Kleppner sure do like to hire
them sweet, young things.

344
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
23, 24 years old, model-thin.

345
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Long, straight hair
and big traffic-light eyes.

346
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,000
And half of them can't write a lick, can they?

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,800
Yeah, our esteemed managing editor.

348
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,900
Certainly does favor
a certain type, don't he?

349
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,900
Gentlemen...

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
Question mark.

351
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Someday, I want to find out what it feels like

352
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,300
to work for a real newspaper.

353
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,200
What? I've got calls out.

354
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
You start writing now, and I'm not here
ten o'clock tonight reworking your lead.

355
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,500
- Reworking my lead?
- Come on, Fletch.

356
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,200
Try to make the e-dot deadline
for once in your life.

357
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,300
- A-matter for the council meeting?
- Yeah.

358
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,900
I'll top it with whatever smells fresh,
make the double-dot.

359
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,200
They're gonna vote
on a homeless ordinance, right?

360
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Maybe not. Nerese is making noises
like she might throw it back to committee.

361
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,100
Yeah? Well, find me some news somewhere.

362
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,600
Something's burning.

363
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,400
You... wondered what it might be?

364
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,900
Hey, I'm not the police reporter.

365
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,900
But you called Twigg, though, right?

366
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,600
At least he's a columnist, he's paid
to sit on his ass. What's your excuse?

367
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,300
Just left him in the smoking lounge.
Hit him on his cell.

368
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,500
What kind of people
stand around watching a fire?

369
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Some shameful shit right here.

370
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Where else would you rather be,
huh, kids?

371
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,900
Hey, Gus.

372
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey, Jay.

373
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,100
A.P. has got something
on more cutbacks in city bus lines.

374
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,400
You don't say.

375
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Daily Record had it this morning.
M.T.A. trial balloon.

376
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,100
State desk is covering.

377
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Daily Record.

378
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,900
All right, people, it's two o'clock,
I need budget lines

379
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,900
in case anybody's threatening to commit
an act of daily journalism.

380
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,200
City desk. Haynes.

381
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
You didn't, huh?

382
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,500
What the fuck are we supposed to do
for centerpiece art?

383
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,900
Great. Wonderful.

384
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,100
Photo didn't get out
for the racetrack piece.

385
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,800
What about art for
the Hopkins press conference?

386
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Scratched it for racetrack.
Hey, Swag, it's me again.

387
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,700
Something's on fire over in East Baltimore.

388
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,100
Surprise me with
a nice, pretty picture, huh?

389
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Look, what we have is drug violence
and plenty of it.

390
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,700
What you have are federal gun statutes that
come with a five-year minimum, no parole,

391
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,000
and we need to lower our murder rate.

392
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,000
Especially since you shorted
your police department budget.

393
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,300
It's no secret we have budget problems,

394
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,000
all the more reason
for the US Attorney to pitch in.

395
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,000
Officially, my priorities
are counterterrorism and political corruption.

396
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,600
So you told me when I asked you for help
on those bodies in the vacant houses.

397
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,300
But I'm inclined to provide you
with a dozen FBI agents

398
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,800
and all the wherewithal
they need to work that case.

399
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,300
But we want Clay Davis to go federal.

400
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,700
Our state's attorney
has developed that case.

401
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Our state's attorney
decides what to do with it.

402
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,100
He seems inclined to keep
Mr. Davis local at this point.

403
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,400
But if you could convince
Mr. Bond to reconsider,

404
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,900
we might find the resources not only for
the probe of the row-house bodies,

405
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,300
but the time to run
some of those gun cases for you.

406
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
But unless you get Clay Davis,
you'll let the killing continue.

407
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Now look, the FBI
and the US Attorney's office

408
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,500
are not here to do the job
that your police department can't.

409
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,800
- Don't blame us for your ineffectiveness.
- Baltimore is knee deep in blood.

410
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,700
Unless this guy can hang a Democratic
legislator, he couldn't give a damn.

411
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,100
And to protect that legislator,

412
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,000
who happens to be one of the most corrupt
extortion artists in the state,

413
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,400
- You'll burn every last bridge.
- Do you think I give a shit about Clay Davis?

414
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
- I am not protecting him.
- Then give him up.

415
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
- It's Bond's call. Talk to him.
- I have.

416
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,400
And he told your Republican ass
to go fuck itself?

417
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
Well, let me double down on that.

418
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,000
Good luck with your crime problem.

419
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That go well?

420
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,700
You know why he wants
the Clay Davis investigation so bad?

421
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,600
So he can stomp all over the Democratic party

422
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
and help give his asshole
Republican golf buddy

423
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,500
another four years
in the governor's mansion.

424
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,100
So, Bond is keeping the case local
to help the party, huh?

425
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,400
No. Bond is keeping the case so that
Clay Davis can be a trophy for Bond.

426
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
My guess is, our newly elected state's attorney

427
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
wants to, one day, run for mayor.

428
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,800
Cuts both ways for you, Nerese.

429
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,400
If the Feds get Clay Davis,
then the case doesn't give Bond any profile,

430
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,300
But if they get him and flip him,

431
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,600
Clay might take half
the Royce administration with him.

432
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,900
You included, maybe.

433
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,400
Don't you worry about me.

434
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,800
You, on the other hand,
just slammed the door on the feds,

435
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,300
when we need all the help we can get.

436
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,600
That's on them.

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,100
Pussy call.

438
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm just glad to know Marlo has a hobby.

439
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Take her to her room,

440
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,500
You know, let her hit the minibar, watch TV.

441
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,800
When she's settled,
we'll take care of the other thing.

442
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
I'll use Monk for my ride.

443
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,900
All right, then,
moving on to new business,

444
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,900
with John Hopkins buying up
everything north of Monument Street

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
and tearing the shit down,

446
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,000
I think we all see the writing on the wall
in East Baltimore.

447
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,900
Yeah. They moving the hood out.

448
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,300
Yo, niggers are going across the line
to Baltimore County.

449
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,100
Pretty soon,
East Baltimore won't be in Essex.

450
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,800
There's a market already along route 40
and down at Turner Station.

451
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,000
- And new territory go to who claim it.
- No. Ordinarily so.

452
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,400
But here we got some of our
east-side people being displaced, right?

453
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,300
I think we need to take care
of those most affected.

454
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,600
Meaning you.

455
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Well, I am east side,
for the most part.

456
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,900
But I'm talking about Hungry Man
and Parker and Ghost.

457
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,600
You know, others beside myself.

458
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,200
Hopkins ain't gonna affect
your market share, Marlo.

459
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
- So for those of us who suffer...
- All right, I see that.

460
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,800
Why don't you let one of your juniors
get a shot to open the county up?

461
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,400
Let a fresh face get a shot at it.

462
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,300
No disrespect, son,
but how I delegate to my lieutenants

463
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
is not a co-op concern.

464
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,300
Yeah, but how Slim feel about that, though?

465
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,900
How you feel, tall man?
Ready to pioneer out there for us?

466
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Nah, I'm good where I am.

467
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,100
Marlo, man, you're a little out of order here.

468
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Yeah, well, it's just a thought.

469
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Look, man,
what's the percentage breakdown...

470
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
Don't sleep on Marlo.

471
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,900
He up to some shit here.

472
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
That was some prime real estate.

473
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,500
It took me six years
to build up them corners.

474
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,300
Reginald.

475
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
Reginald.

476
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,300
I'm going to work,
you know I got night shift all this week.

477
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,800
You know,
I could stay down here quiet like,

478
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,100
you ain't need to sweat.

479
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,300
You don't stay here when I'm not around.
That's our rule.

480
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm your brother.
I got nowhere to go when I leave.

481
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,900
Last time I left you alone in my home,
you dragged half my kitchen to a pawn shop.

482
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Remember that?

483
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,800
But you can keep the door locked, right?

484
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,200
I'm down here.

485
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,100
My rules.

486
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
You said.

487
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,400
The courthouse? What the fuck?

488
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
I'll go in.

489
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,300
Rupert.

490
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
What now?

491
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,900
Major crimes is being disbanded.

492
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,400
The detectives return to regular rotation.

493
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,000
I got the word yesterday from command.
The mayor signed off.

494
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,100
They're quietly deep-sixing the investigation
into the bodies and Marlo Stanfield.

495
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
- A money thing?
- They're pulling back on everything.

496
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Man hours, equipment,
lab work, motor pool.

497
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,300
Every last dollar we can find is being
shipped over to plug the school system budget.

498
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,700
Cedric thought he would try
to reason with Carcetti,

499
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
maybe see if we can keep
the Stanfield detail, at least.

500
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,500
What about Clay Davis?
That's going to grand jury soon.

501
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,700
If they ship Freamon back to homicide,
I don't have him on that, either,

502
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,400
and Lester pretty much is that case.

503
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,100
Excuse me.
Y'all know where the clerk's office at?

504
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,800
- Criminal or civil?
- Criminal, definitely.

505
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
End of the hall, last door.

506
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,200
- When are you meeting the mayor?
- About an hour.

507
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,400
They gave me a few minutes
on the end of his day.

508
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,100
I'll go with you.
Come by my office and get me.

509
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,900
So, where you off to now?

510
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Motions hearing in part 18.
It's the last thing on my sched.

511
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,300
And for state desk?

512
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Additional cutbacks are said to be coming
in the city M.T.A. routes.

513
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,900
- Trial balloon from the governor.
- Affects a lot of people, no?

514
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,200
If it happens.
They floated this once before.

515
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,900
Still, we can go outside
and give them the potential impact.

516
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Well, the truth is, we're following
the Daily Record on this one.

517
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,400
Why don't we have that?
If it's a trial balloon...

518
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,600
We've been without a transport reporter
since the last round of buyouts, so...

519
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
- We should still pick that up.
- Probably so, but...

520
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,700
Just because Chicago tightens its belt,
it's no reason for us to fall down.

521
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,900
Their cutbacks there shouldn't affect
our ability to put out an excellent product.

522
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,300
Simply have to do more with less.

523
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
We have more resources
than the Daily Record.

524
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,900
Though not a transport reporter.

525
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,100
Your eminence,
slumming at the Metro meeting today?

526
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,000
- What do you know?
- City desk.

527
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
State's attorney complains about
the decline in quality police casework,

528
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,200
20 inches from Warmcastle.
Got the city council tonight.

529
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,100
Won't get a vote on the homeless initiative,
but we'll scratch some news out somehow.

530
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,800
Two-car fatal on the Beltway,
two overnight murders in the city,

531
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
and a fire ongoing
in a Baltimore City row house

532
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,900
for which we may or may not have art.

533
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,100
Regional affairs.

534
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
We have the Hopkins piece on biomed,

535
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,700
though I'm told we didn't get art
on today's press conference.

536
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,400
And 15 inches from the college park stringer
on UM not making it's deseg goals again.

537
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm told that, numbers aside,

538
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,200
the campus has become
much more hospitable to minorities.

539
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,000
- I'm told things have changed for the better.
- Really?

540
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,700
As you may know, Gene Robbins
is dean of journalism there.

541
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,600
I had lunch with him the other day...

542
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
- Nevertheless, they haven't...
...and he was saying

543
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,000
how the last few years have really transformed
the school's reputation

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,300
with black faculty and students.

545
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
- He's a white guy, right?
- Who?

546
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,500
Journalism fellow. Dean Wormer,
Dean Martin - whatever his name is.

547
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,100
I worked with Gene Robbins
in Philadelphia.

548
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
He is an excellent journalist
and a reliable source.

549
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,700
I think race is beside the point.

550
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,400
So why don't we hold on the deseg story

551
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,400
until we can assign someone
to do some more reporting,

552
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,100
get a real sense of how UM
is perceived by minorities?

553
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
All right, then. Let's firm things up,

554
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,800
Take a look at where we stand
an hour from now.

555
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,200
Why poke him with a stick?
You know who Gene Robbins is.

556
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
Who's poking?

557
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,300
If I think something about a story,
I'm gonna speak on it.

558
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,200
You know what a healthy newsroom is?

559
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,200
It's a magical place where people
argue about everything all the time.

560
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,400
- I'm not poking anyone here.
- "Dean Martin"?

561
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,900
Yeah, a little poke.

562
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Thank you.

563
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
I know that wasn't no court date.

564
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,100
You already got the gun charge
postponed twice.

565
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
So what the fuck was that about?

566
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,600
Remember that Russian
we locked up for murder,

567
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,300
part of the port case years back?

568
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,200
I didn't work that case with you, man.

569
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,100
So, no, I don't remember.

570
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Well, Chris Partlow does.

571
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,100
Miss Gutierrez.

572
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,600
Gutierrez!

573
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,900
Get your ass over here.

574
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
Yeah.

575
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,500
You say that 120 people were evacuated.

576
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,900
Yeah. They were.

577
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,500
You can't evacuate people.

578
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
I mean, you can, if you want,
but that's not what you want to say here.

579
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
A building can be evacuated.

580
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,100
To evacuate a person
is to give that person an enema.

581
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,400
The details, Miss Gutierrez.

582
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,400
At the Baltimore Sun,
God still resides in the details.

583
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
You teach them, Spry.

584
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,900
What are we gonna do
with these children today?

585
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,100
Fuckety-fuck.

586
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,300
Another burnt doll.

587
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,900
Carlyle again.

588
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
- Photo.
- I'm looking at the fire art from East Baltimore

589
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,000
and I got a burnt Barbie in foreground.

590
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

591
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,000
And I might actually believe you
if it wasn't Carlyle who took the shot.

592
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,900
No fuckin' way I believe in this picture.
Print me something else.

593
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,200
Every fire photo he brings in

594
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,600
there's got to be some burnt doll
somewhere in the debris.

595
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,600
I can see that cheating motherfucker now
with his fucking harem of dolls

596
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,800
pouring lighter fluid on each one.

597
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,400
You check his fucking trunk,
you'll find a whole collection.

598
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,500
What's your lead?

599
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,200
Council delays vote on
the homeless initiative at Carcetti's behest.

600
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,900
He doesn't want it to look like the city's
running the homeless out of downtown,

601
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so he asked Nerese
to redraft the measure.

602
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,300
He's right.
You don't evacuate people.

603
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,200
- What?
- Never mind.

604
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,500
- Working on anything good?
- Just what day cops missed.

605
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,600
A fatal in Charles County
and a gas leak downtown.

606
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,200
Briefs, huh?

607
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,600
Quiet day so far.

608
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,500
- It's a shit news town.
- You think?

609
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,400
How many stories go national out of here?
Not many.

610
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,600
Those bodies in the houses last year.
That got a lot of play.

611
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,500
And they didn't even solve it, right?

612
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
The story had no legs at all.

613
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
Since then, what else?

614
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,700
Jeff. Jeffy-Jeff.

615
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,100
What?

616
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,600
Come here. Jesus Christ.

617
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,700
What now?

618
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Did you stay for the zoning bills?

619
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,200
- No, I came back here to write.
- Check the fucking library.

620
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,400
Shit, check the clips too.
It goes back a-ways.

621
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,100
Check that. You go back to the hall,
you get the vote on this thing.

622
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,500
Find out who sponsored this.

623
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Find out whether Carcetti
or Nerese or whoever's behind it.

624
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,300
You buttonhole them,
find out what the hell's going on.

625
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Why? Who's Ricardo Hendrix?

626
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,700
A drug dealer. Fatface Rick.

627
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Alma, Scott, this property
on Baltimore Street is a titty bar

628
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,900
the city wants for
the Howard Street enterprise zone,

629
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,400
but this other property
they want to trade with him,

630
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,900
I want to find out what that's all about.

631
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,500
This is a drug dealer
they're trading properties with?

632
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,400
He's got a record as long as your arm.
Couple of convictions too.

633
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,300
Go, go. Get some good quotes.

634
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,600
Alma... I want you to go to this address.

635
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,000
It's a strip club called Desperado.

636
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,900
You ask around for the owner.
His name's Ricardo Hendrix.

637
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,000
You tell them until we get a comment,
we'll put Ricky on the front page every day.

638
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,500
Who is he?

639
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,900
He's a drug dealer.

640
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,500
But from the look of this,
he's running some sort of game at city hall.

641
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,300
We want a comment as to why
he's trading property with the city,

642
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,700
- What he stands to make off the deal.
- OK.

643
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,100
What do you want from me?

644
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,500
Pull clips, check the morgue files,

645
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,400
write the A-matter on Ricardo's history.

646
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,700
Wait, she goes to strip clubs
and I'm pulling clips in the morgue?

647
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,900
- You late for the council meeting?
- Looking for you.

648
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,800
Me? I'm racing. Late for some
charity thing at the Walters'.

649
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,200
Mr. Mayor, I was told I could
get a few minutes tonight.

650
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,400
- You're on my schedule?
- Everything ran late today.

651
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,300
- They were supposed to ring you, I think.
- What, do it quick or do we resched?

652
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,500
Burrell's disbanded the unit
that's working the bodies in the houses.

653
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,600
When we're fat with money,
you can come back on it.

654
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,400
Investigations are not like that.

655
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,400
You can't just drop one
and then pick it up down the road without...

656
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,700
Colonel, we got no money.
No fucking money at all.

657
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,700
There's nothing we can do
until the new fiscal.

658
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,400
But, Tommy, that kills Clay Davis for me
and we're about to go to grand jury on it.

659
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,600
Same unit is doing Clay?

660
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
I need some profile for my shop.

661
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,100
How much of that unit do you need
to bring the case in?

662
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,600
A couple of detectives.

663
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'll tell Rawls you can keep two men for Clay.
The rest is shut down until we can dig out.

664
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,100
I got to run.

665
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So one thieving politician
trumps 22 dead bodies.

666
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,500
Good to know.

667
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,000
To save money, they're not even
putting ops cars in the street.

668
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,300
No more two-man patrols.

669
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,100
Jesus, where did the money go?

670
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,100
Schools.

671
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,300
Carcetti didn't want to lay off teachers,
so he fucks us instead.

672
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,000
Seems like you got out
at the right time, huh?

673
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
Look at you.

674
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,400
Here's our boy Thomas sporting
the latest in downtown businesswear,

675
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,800
An understated ensemble
that puts the "b" in subtle.

676
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,500
There's a "b" in subtle?

677
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,000
Seriously, you look well, Herc.

678
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,500
I'm doing good, man.

679
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,200
I got more work than I can get to.

680
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,800
It's like once word got around,

681
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,500
these fucking lawyers
came out of the fucking woodwork.

682
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,900
Which reminds me, I need one of you guys
to run a name for me.

683
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Tags, registration, and phone.
While you're at it, run a sheeting photo.

684
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,500
'Cause I'm buying the next round, right?

685
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,300
About fucking time!

686
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,000
Not used to having money,
you kind of forget. Let's get a round.

687
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,100
How does it read?

688
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
It's clean and it bites.

689
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,200
- Deserves a front, off-lead, maybe.
- And we're saying what?

690
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,800
That it's a sweetheart deal
for a titty bar owner with a big criminal history.

691
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,600
He sells his existing location
to the city for 1.2 million

692
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,800
and they sell him
a better piece of real estate

693
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
to relocate his club
five blocks west for 200,000.

694
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,200
- He clears a million for laying in the cut.
- What's the quid pro quo?

695
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,400
We're going through donors
in Nerese's campaign committee.

696
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,200
So far, we got 40,000 from Ricardo Hendrix

697
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,200
and a bunch of people all using
the same address as the bar.

698
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,700
Why wasn't this on your budget?

699
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,100
Well, we found it...
Actually, Jeff Price found it

700
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,900
hidden in the zoning bills,
bottom of the council agenda.

701
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,900
He caught it late, but he caught it.

702
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,500
All right, front page, below the fold.

703
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Yeah.

704
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,200
Metro desk, Phelps.

705
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,900
Gus, Price for you, line two,
and he's got Nerese with him.

706
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,100
Aw, shit, here it comes.

707
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,300
Gus? It's Jeff.

708
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
The council president
would like a word with you.

709
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,500
- On the record?
- No. She's given me her quote.

710
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,100
- She wants to talk to you off the record.
- Put her on.

711
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,900
This is all perfectly above board.

712
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,600
No doubt, Madam President.

713
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
We need this property for redevelopment

714
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,800
and it's in the city's interest
to allow Mr. Hendrix to relocate.

715
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,200
Is it in the city's interest
to give him a property

716
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,000
with twice as much floor space

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and give him a million dollars for his trouble?

718
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,400
Do you think you made it clear to the council

719
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,500
that Mr. Hendrix donated $60,000
to your campaign committee?

720
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,500
I don't know, ma'am,

721
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,500
where I live, 60,000 buys a lot of goodwill.

722
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,300
Hey, Jeff, is that you?

723
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,400
I'm putting you on hold for Spry.

724
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Yeah, give me your on the record for Nerese.

725
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,800
- Ready?
- Yeah.

726
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,500
Shame we couldn't use
what she just gave us.

727
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,300
What do you got?

728
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,800
Keep running through
that campaign finance shit.

729
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,300
There's at least $20,000
in contributions we haven't found yet.

730
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,200
Nerese all but confirmed it.

731
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
I'll be back.

732
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,200
It's me.

733
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,500
Yeah, we're going late tonight.

734
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,900
Fine.

735
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,300
No, I'm not.

736
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
I'm just tired, is all.

737
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
I slur when I'm tired.

738
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,000
That's all.

739
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,800
Yeah.

740
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,700
Night.

741
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Blue tops, all the rocks.

742
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,500
Blue tops.

743
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,800
Blue tops, get 'em while they hot.
Come and get your blue tops.

744
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,800
Bubs, yo.

745
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,300
Hauk?

746
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,100
It was a great pull at deadline.

747
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,700
Hey, any night a Baltimore politician
calls you a son of a bitch is a good night.

748
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
Am I right?

749
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,900
Hey, that was a good pull by Alma,

750
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,800
getting that quote from
Fatface Rick for the home final.

751
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,000
"Hey, I'm a businessman. City wants
to help me out, I ain't gonna argue." Sweet.

752
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
- Thank you.
- How'd you get him to talk to you?

753
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,800
I just walked in, sat down,

754
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,600
watched the dancers for a few minutes,
and he came over to me.

755
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,000
Thought I was looking for a job.

756
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,000
You deserve more than
a contributing line for that.

757
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,900
I don't know, a contrib line is cool.

758
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,100
You can't go far on contrib lines.

759
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,900
Where do you want to go?

760
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,400
Times or Post. Where else?

761
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,600
I don't know.
This is still a pretty good paper.

762
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,000
I brought it to the mayor personally,

763
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,800
but they're throwing their last dollars
into patrol and crime suppression.

764
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,900
You think being on Marlo and his people
every damn day for a year

765
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,600
isn't crime suppression?

766
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,100
We lowered the body count
just by sitting on these people.

767
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,100
- They know they're hot, huh?
- After a year?

768
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,400
Look. Promises were made to me, as well.

769
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,400
I was told a new day was coming.

770
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,200
Clearly, this isn't it.

771
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,500
Where are we going, then?

772
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,700
You and McNulty are back
to the Homicide rotation.

773
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,800
Dozerman is temporarily assigned to tactical.

774
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,400
Lieutenant, you're going to fill
a vacancy in the Northern, four to 12 shift.

775
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,400
Freamon, Sydnor, you two are assigned
to the state's attorney's office

776
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,900
to help grand-jury the Clay Davis thing.

777
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,800
When the money starts to flow,

778
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,500
I'll get you all back on this somehow.

779
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,700
Sorry.

780
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,200
Wonder what it feels like to work
in a real fucking police department.

781
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,600
50 cent.

782
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,400
50 cent.

783
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,100
Obliged.

784
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,700
When did this break last night?

785
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,600
Gus saw it on the council agenda around 9:30.

786
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,600
It's a good fucking story.

787
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,300
Who's doing the react piece?

788
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,700
Jeff will, why?

789
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,100
I'm just...

790
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
I need a story. I'm up.

791
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,200
Yeah. Stay hungry like that.

792
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,800
Good things come when they come.

793
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,100
It's two o'clock, people.

794
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,700
I need budget lines.

795
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,200
There are a million stories in the naked city,

796
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,200
but today you poor mooks
only need to throw me three or four.

797
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,300
The Orioles will not pay for pitcher.
I should have never left the Bronx.

798
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,600
- You see this?
- What?

799
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,600
One of our clients on the front page.

800
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,600
Represent Tiger Woods?

801
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,800
All it cost me was a round of beers.

802
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,900
They fucking love me in the department.
I'm a fucking martyr is what I am.

803
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,500
Pull over some black minister,
piss him off,

804
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,000
and I lose my fucking job.

805
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,400
One round?

806
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,300
You, a prominent defense investigator,

807
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,000
let these other guys
buy a round of drinks ever?

808
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,100
Kid, it's time you learned a little something
about the expense account.

809
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
That's my desk.

810
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,500
What the fuck you saying?

811
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,600
The prodigal son.
