1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
- 23-16.
- Yeah, Lester.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
- Where are you at?
- On Monk in East Baltimore.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,700
- Who's on Marlo?
- No one right now.

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,800
Marlo's been the hardest to follow.
Too paranoid. Too much counter-surveillance.

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,900
Well, peel off Monk and head out
Broening Highway to the marine terminals.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Map 44, grid G-as-in-George 10.

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,700
- 44.
- Affirmative. This is a fresh one.

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,300
If they're going all the way out there,
it might just be...

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,500
- Damn right.
- On it.

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,300
23-06 to all units on this detail.
New 20 is map 44.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
Grid G-George 10.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,600
That's 44 G-George 10.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,800
Flood that grid and look for suspect vehicles.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,200
23-12. 10-4.

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,300
Take me a while. I'm up Northeast.
You want me to stay on Cheese?

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Negative. New 20 is a priority.
Think we're on the main stem.

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
- Yeah?
- McNulty? It's on.

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,700
- Yeah?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
All right...

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,700
OK, whatchya got?

21
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,000
We rolled around until
Bobby spotted Chris Partlow

22
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
pulled up on a lot two blocks from here.

23
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,100
So we sat on him until Marlo posted.
They talked for a minute, then Marlo bounced.

24
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,500
And Chris goes to the warehouse gate alone
and a coupla white boys open up.

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,900
He's inside now?

26
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,700
Entrance is around front, it's the only
working gate. Everything else is rusted up.

27
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
- Who's watching the front?
- Two units.

28
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
They're out on foot, a block away,
with a clear view of what comes in or out.

29
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,500
So what do we do if Chris rolls out?

30
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,900
Let him go. Partlow is muscle.
He's here to make sure it looks right.

31
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,700
And if it does,
Monk or someone else'll come on down.

32
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
- Cheese, too, maybe.
- So this is a re-up.

33
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,900
Fuck a re-up, son.
This, here, in the middle of nowhere...

34
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,400
Miles from anywhere these mopes meet...
This is re-supply.

35
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
Other than Chris,
anybody else that goes in there,

36
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,900
if it's a Stanfield lieutenant
he's coming out dirty.

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,500
Follow them back to town. If he doesn't know
you're on 'em, see where he takes you.

38
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,700
If he catches a scent, fuck it.

39
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,500
Pull 'em over, jack 'em up and get the dope.

40
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,400
And you want to snatch the man's cell
before he has a chance to erase anything.

41
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,900
The case is in the phones...

42
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,000
Though we're gonna need a title three
to take a look at them.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,700
Where are you going?

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Time to 'fess up.

45
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,400
We straight?

46
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
I said we straight, right?

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,600
Them guns was mine.

48
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
Which guns specifically?

49
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,500
Whatever guns them cops
took out the truck last year. They mine.

50
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Even though I ain't touched that iron.

51
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,100
Ain't you got to do the bit.

52
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,400
With your limited priors, Mr. Hill,
you're exposed to two, three years, tops.

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
You'll be well compensated
for the time, I'm sure.

54
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,500
No good to us no how.
You on three legs.

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Familiarize yourself with the make and model
of the weapons you left in the truck, Mr. Hill.

56
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,600
- The details matter.
- I get shot up an' then this shit.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,800
- Y'all ask a lot, don'tcha?
- You can't hack, go down Wal-mart.

58
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,500
And see if they take care you
while you laid up for a while.

59
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,900
C'mon, nigger.

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,700
Jeez.
In the department, you take one in the line

61
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,800
they give you light duty
for as long as you need,

62
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
then you get to name your next assignment.

63
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Marlo runs a tighter ship.

64
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Open it.

65
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Six icebox, 20 each.

66
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
You count, we wait.

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,100
You no count, we go to lunch early.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
23-14 to 23-06.

69
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Suspect number three is in.

70
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,600
- You sure?
- Been following the damn truck for a week.

71
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
- Should know by now.
- Copy that.

72
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Ticks have six legs or eight?

73
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Must have been a readjustment.

74
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,900
London was a sweet posting. I can't lie.

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
My only regret is I didn't
get the full three-year tour.

76
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,100
- Thanks.
- It's no reflection on you, man.

77
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Shit, Gus, they even sold
the building in Kensington.

78
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,800
We bought that sucker
for nothing 50 years ago,

79
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,400
and now Chicago sells it off
for a couple million pounds.

80
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
Capitalization, they call it.

81
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,200
These newspaper-chain guys
just don't give a fuck, do they?

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,300
Any idea where they're gonna drop you now
that you're back in Charm City?

83
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,500
No, I got no idea yet.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Klebanow wants to have lunch, so I guess
it'll come at me, soon enough.

85
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
- Up for something now?
- Depends.

86
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,100
I gotta problem. I need someone...

87
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,100
A veteran reporter, quiet,
subtle, discreet, good with details,

88
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
careful to cover his tracks...

89
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't care how far we go back, Gus,
no way I'm gonna kill your wife for you.

90
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,000
You know Scott Templeton? City G.A.

91
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,300
The guy talking to the homeless killer?

92
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,400
Not really.

93
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,000
- He got hired after I went to London.
- It's better you don't know him.

94
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,600
No opinions, one way or the other.

95
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,900
No, no, I'm not saying anything.

96
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm not. I just need
fresh eyes on the fella. Just a careful look.

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,400
- One of Whiting's pets, isn't he?
- I said discreet.

98
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
- I hope you're wrong.
- Course you do.

99
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,800
- It sticks. Dag.
- Course it sticks. It's barb wire.

100
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Sticking's what it's s'posed to do.

101
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,200
Come on. I ain't got all day.

102
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Hurry up now.
Grab the aluminum strips there first off.

103
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,600
- How am I supposed to get back over?
- Climb the damn fence.

104
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,400
Do a better job of it second time, I expect.

105
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,100
Grab them steel pipes quick
before we get spotted.

106
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,700
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

107
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,200
I need a global printout on everything
under Scott Templeton's byline.

108
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
All of it, every edition.

109
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey, I'm a fan.

110
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,100
23-14.

111
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,500
Monk is westbound onto O'Donnell.
Cheese Wagstaff is on the way in.

112
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Also, the truck we saw back
on the loading dock is leaving.

113
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
That'd be empty. They've offloaded,
it's all in the warehouse now.

114
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Bobby and me will stay on Monk. Karen'll
follow Cheese out, you stay on the gate.

115
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,700
Forgetting for a moment
our little problem of the serial killer,

116
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
we came in promising a double-digit drop
in violent crime.

117
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,500
Right up on the gubernatorial primary,
and we're looking at another record high.

118
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Michael, this department has been crippled
by the budget cuts.

119
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
For a year now, we haven't had
the manpower or the tools.

120
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,400
- You have them now.
- Now. But this thing is a ship,

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,200
a super-tanker.
We can't just turn it around like that.

122
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
More foot patrols.
More cars on the street.

123
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Get a handle on it, dammit.

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,400
See that's what doesn't work.

125
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,600
More cops where people can see them.
More cops on the pavement,

126
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
more cops riding past,
more cops showing the flag

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
so that you guys can say
you're being tough on crime.

128
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,700
Respectfully, sir, what works
is committing to building a real deterrent.

129
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,200
We take the time to retool,
to teach our people not to chase stats,

130
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,600
- But to do actual police work.
- Who pulled your string, deputy?

131
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,000
I was told by our mayor at the outset that
there would be no more Band-Aids,

132
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,900
no more stat games...

133
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Then we got hit with the school budget. And
lost some of the time we needed to address

134
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
the systemic things you're talking about.

135
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
Understood. We will work back on those,

136
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,900
and we will support that kind of reform,
if not from City Hall

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
then from Annapolis, if need be.

138
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,000
But now, deputy, right now,
my boss needs the crime to go down.

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Not three years from now.
Not even a year from now.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,900
He needs a ten-percent drop
in the next quarter...

141
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,400
Or no one is gonna be in a position
to reform anything.

142
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Be creative, gentlemen.

143
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,000
Deputy. A detective's outside for you,

144
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
says it's urgent.

145
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,300
Sydnor and I developed a source

146
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
and ran fresh surveillances on Marlo Stanfield.

147
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,200
And we believe we're about to catch
his people very dirty.

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
- What?
- We wrapped on that Clay Davis thing

149
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,900
and instead of shutting Major Crimes down,

150
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,500
we took a couple weeks
and got back up on Marlo.

151
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
With the right warrants, he's about to fall.

152
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
- How the fuck...
- There's no time, Cedric.

153
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,700
In an hour or so, I'm gonna need...

154
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah?

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,700
- Lester...
- What's up?

156
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,500
We pulled up Monk.
Dirty as a motherfucker.

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,500
Eight keys of the raw.

158
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,100
No, he jersey-rolled a stop
and when we tried to pull him over,

159
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,800
he went rabbit on us.

160
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,900
We ran him down on Lafayette,
by the overpass.

161
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,400
- You got the phone, right?
- Yeah, man. I got it.

162
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,800
Good work.

163
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,700
It's down.

164
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I need teams to arrest Marlo Stanfield,
Chris Partlow, and Cheese Wagstaff.

165
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,600
I also need someone from our S.A.O.
to get on the horn

166
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
to Baltimore county for an S-and-S warrant
on a Middle River warehouse.

167
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
And, oh yeah...

168
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,600
Bunk Moreland
has a warrant on Partlow

169
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
for a separate homicide.

170
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,300
He held that back so we could
do this business here.

171
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,000
Anything else you've neglected
to tell me, Detective Freamon?

172
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,100
No sir. I think you're caught up.

173
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
- Hello?
- Ronnie, dear.

174
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,700
Hey...

175
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,500
- Are you sitting down?
- Why?

176
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,200
He was trying to erase shit
when we tackled him.

177
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,200
Secure this location
until we have written search-and-seizure.

178
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,200
Shit's on TV, yo.

179
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,900
With a street value of almost
sixteen million dollars in heroin,

180
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,300
and charges against high-level traffickers

181
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,600
who were going to put this poison
on the streets of this city...

182
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,500
Do this mean I still gotta take
that charge for y'all?

183
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,500
...and perseverance
by our police department.

184
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,900
And while I am told that this
investigation is continuing,

185
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,500
it is my understanding
that there is at least one murder warrant

186
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,600
associated with this drug organization,

187
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,700
which is believed to have been responsible

188
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,100
for many of those bodies found in vacant
rowhouses more than a year ago.

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,400
We did not give up on that investigation
just as we do not give up trying every day

190
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,300
to address ourselves to the task of making
this city safe and vibrant again.

191
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Let me just say to all others responsible for the
drug trade's assault on the welfare of this city,

192
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,800
a day like this is coming for you.

193
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,300
Oh, you are so butch.

194
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,300
I have seen what drugs
have done to Baltimore.

195
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,400
Drug dealers do not just
destroy individuals. They destroy families.

196
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,700
Don't forget the communities.

197
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
They destroy entire communities.

198
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,800
Today the mayor of Baltimore,
our state's attorney,

199
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,300
our police department,
and our communities are saying,

200
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
"We have had enough."
Thank you.

201
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,100
Deputy. Alma Gutierrez, Sun papers.

202
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
Care to comment?

203
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
It's a good day for the good guys.

204
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
Could you be a bit more substantive?

205
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,000
Last time the Sun had me in its pages,
you had me doing things I didn't do.

206
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,300
- Regarding?
- Something about me

207
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,300
stabbing someone in the back.
Look it up.

208
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,500
"A source of information

209
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,900
"identified the transmission of photographs
via cellphone."

210
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,600
Fuck do that mean?
"Source of information."

211
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,700
- They sayin' somebody talkin'?
- Who the fuck even know?

212
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
I wanna talk to the lawyer.

213
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,800
And you caught a murder, too.
Says the same shit on yours, huh?

214
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,800
"From information received,
investigation led to DNA analysis of the victim."

215
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,500
- They got you on DNA?
- My hair, I expect.

216
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,200
"From information received."
More of that snitchin' shit.

217
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm sayin', where the information come from?

218
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,600
Onliest people knew is us right here.

219
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,900
- Snoop knew.
- Shit.

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,700
What about your young'un Michael?
Maybe it was him ran his mouth.

221
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,300
- He got picked up, right?
- I did that thing for him.

222
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,400
- Why would he talk about it an' put hisself in?
- He been tested on the streets.

223
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Maybe he act different in the rooms downtown.

224
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
Boy been throwin' up
all kinda backtalk 'bout shit.

225
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
- Buck' wild about this 'n that.
- Like what?

226
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,300
Cryin' about how June Bug
and his people got lit up.

227
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,800
Cryin' about how Omar in the street runnin'
his mouth, callin' for you to step to...

228
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,000
- Omar say what?
- Nuthin'.

229
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,200
Omar tried callin' you out by name.
But, shit, it wadn't nothin'...

230
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,100
- What he say about me?
- Nuthin', man. Just talkin' shit.

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,300
He use my name?
In the street?

232
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,300
- Talk, motherfucker.
- He just, ya know...

233
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
Say that you need to step to and that...

234
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I dunno, he just runnin' his mouth some.

235
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,900
- He call me a punk?
- It was bullshit, man.

236
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,600
- You ain't need that on your mind.
- What the fuck you know about

237
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,900
what I need on my mind, motherfucker?

238
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
My name was on the street.

239
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,400
When we bounce from this shit here,
y'all gonna go down to them corners,

240
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,500
let them people know.
Word did not get back to me.

241
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,000
Let 'em know Marlo step to any motherfucker.
Omar, Barksdale... Whoever.

242
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,600
My name is my name.

243
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
- Don't see the boy snitchin'.
- Neither do I.

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
But you ready to bet your future on that?

245
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
Ya see that, McNulty?
Ya see it?

246
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
One detective, working the file,
running a few things down and bang...

247
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,300
He's got an arrest.

248
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,900
Shit, now that Chris Partlow's locked up,
we might have some witnesses coming forward

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
on those cases in the vacants.

250
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,800
- Clear 'em all on paper.
- We got the one is all, boss.

251
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,000
One today, more tomorrow.
And from what?

252
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,900
From the Bunk just workin' a file.

253
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,600
Business as usual. But you...

254
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
With your overtime and your cars
and your surveillance detail

255
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,000
and your bullshit, where the fuck
are you on your red ball?

256
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Nowhere.

257
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,200
Killer stopped calling.
Stopped killing, too.

258
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
I admit it. I'm nowhere.

259
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,400
From everything we've given you,
fire should be shooting out your ass,

260
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
but no, there you sit like a genital wart.

261
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,900
C'mon, McNulty.
Show me something.

262
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,600
So what are you gonna do now?

263
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Keep half a district worth of manpower
on the street, chasing bullshit?

264
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,300
It'll wind down.

265
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,400
No more killing, no more disappearances,
no more calls.

266
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
- Marlo is in cuffs.
- Fuck Marlo.

267
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,500
Fuck you.

268
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,600
- What's going on in Klebanow's office?
- Planning meeting.

269
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,100
- Pulitzer submissions.
- This early?

270
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,200
The important thing is that we build on this

271
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,800
through the end of the year,
with no falloff of coverage.

272
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Exactly.
And Scott, we need to start looking

273
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
for the points where the response
to the problem can be criticized.

274
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
The "gotcha". I know.

275
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,300
At this point, we can't tell what category
we'll enter with this,

276
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
but in public service especially,

277
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,500
greater weight is given to stories that result
in changes to policy, or new legislation.

278
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,900
So covering the reactions to our stories
is as important as the stories themselves.

279
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,200
Until New Year's, we want to hammer
at whatever changes or discussions

280
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,500
or actions result from your
coverage of the homeless.

281
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,100
And graphics matter. Our presentation
must be clean and professional

282
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
when it goes to the committee.

283
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,100
You guys really think
this has a shot at a Pulitzer?

284
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
I do and it does.

285
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,800
Being on the Pulitzer board
for a couple of terms,

286
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
I've seen the process up close.

287
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,900
There's a way of doing these things.
Time honored.

288
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Knowing how is
why they pay me the big bucks.

289
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,600
All right. What do we want to say exactly?
With our coverage.

290
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,100
What do we want to say about homelessness?
I mean, it's bad.

291
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,700
It's very bad, granted. But isn't it actually
symptomatic of a much greater dynamic...

292
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,000
We want to rediscover a world
that for too long has been ignored.

293
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Examine the tragedy
underlying these murders, the neglect...

294
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,300
- The Dickensian aspect.
- Exactly.

295
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,200
Alma, dearest.

296
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,700
This quote from Daniels,
"It's a good day for the good guys."

297
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,300
- He couldn't come up with anything better?
- He wouldn't play.

298
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,700
Says we took his name in vain
last time we used it.

299
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,800
When was that?

300
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,900
When we had him backstabbing
Burrell at City Hall?

301
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,100
Do you want me to call Daniels at home?
Try him again?

302
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
- We're past deadline, Gus.
- I'll cut the quote.

303
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
All right.

304
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,900
Drink with me, Jimmy.

305
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,900
This is what you wanted, man.

306
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Then why do I feel like shit?

307
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,900
Postpartum depression, son.

308
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
It's the journey, not the destination...

309
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We got Marlo Stanfield.

310
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,300
- What about the serial killer?
- Marlo is he.

311
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Daniels wanted me up there
at that press conference.

312
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,700
Up there with all the rest of
those preening motherfuckers,

313
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,900
congratulating themselves
on a job well done.

314
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,900
Part of the problem, all of them.

315
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Yet when the bracelets come out
and the dope is on the table...

316
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,300
We've still got the surveillance teams.

317
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,500
The districts still have guys
watching the homeless,

318
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
undercovers dressed as homeless...

319
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,100
That shit'll end.

320
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,100
It always does.

321
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,900
Well...

322
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
If you ain't gonna celebrate with me,

323
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
you're gonna at least
chauffeur my drunken ass home.

324
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Shardene better be awake, too.

325
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,300
'Cause I do believe Lester Freamon's
in the mood for love...

326
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,300
Yo, I'm tellin' you, it was Kenard.

327
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Murder police been to his crib
three times tryin' to catch up with him.

328
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,600
Bullshit.
Omar got kilt by them Pimlico boys.

329
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,200
They ran up on him with three
AKs an' jus' blazed away.

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,900
- What up, soldier?
- I don't know. You tell me.

331
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,300
I mean, everybody locked up, right?
Damn...

332
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Yeah. 'Cause-a that shit, I'm 'a need you
for some serious business tomorrow.

333
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
- Anyone I know?
- Big Walter.

334
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,000
- Big-nose Big Walter?
- Nah, skinny Big Walter,

335
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,900
the one be right there in front of the
Cut-rate on Calhoun and Riggs all the time.

336
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,200
- He witnessin'?
- Marlo say he need to get got.

337
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,600
So it is, what it is.

338
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
- You got a problem with that?
- We straight.

339
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,300
No need to bring your iron.

340
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
I got a clean nine for you
with shaved numbers.

341
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
I'll pick you up tomorrow night.

342
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
You a'ight?

343
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,600
- Yeah, yeah.
- A'ight.

344
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,100
In the last five years, the United States has
given 15 billion dollars to fight HIV and AIDS

345
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,800
around the world.
But only part of it goes to Africa,

346
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
where there's a huge epidemic
of HIV and AIDS.

347
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
I mean, ten percent
of the population of the world

348
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,900
lives in sub-Saharan Africa, but 70 percent
of the new AIDS cases are there.

349
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,600
In Kenya, one in seven people
have HIV and AIDS,

350
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,100
and in Zimbabwe,
one in four people have it,

351
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,200
according to the article in
the New York Human Rights Law Review.

352
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Plus, the US Surgeon General has said that
there are 22 million people with HIV and AIDS

353
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
in those African countries.

354
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,100
In the next ten years,
more people will die from AIDS

355
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,700
in these countries than
all the wars in the 20th century,

356
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
including World War Two,
the deadliest war...

357
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,900
How's it feelin', Bunny?

358
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,500
I tell ya, if I had that boy's gift to talk,
I'd a really caused a stir.

359
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Look at him go...

360
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,000
Don't sell yourself short.
He's got your way of makin' an argument.

361
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,500
Lucky for him, though,
he looks like his stepmama.

362
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,200
And AIDS in Africa said US Money
can make a huge difference in Africa

363
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,300
where even very small
amounts can go a long way.

364
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,700
There seems to be an agreement that
the money should be spent in two ways:

365
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,300
Medical treatment
and for education and prevention.

366
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,500
However, there is not an
agreement on how much money

367
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,400
will be needed and what programs...

368
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,800
- When do we bounce?
- I'm working on bail reviews.

369
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,000
Cheese maybe...

370
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,500
On a high surety bond, if he wants
to put up his mama's house. Monk, the same.

371
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,500
But with the murder warrant,
there is no bail for Chris,

372
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,000
and most likely, there's no bail for you,

373
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,800
as the charging papers portray you
at the top of the conspiracy.

374
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,200
How can they say that
when I ain't go near no drugs at all?

375
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
The full affidavit says they developed
a source of information...

376
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Bullshit.

377
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,100
A source of information who told them that
you communicated with each other

378
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,200
using photographic transmissions
on cellphones. Coded transmissions.

379
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,700
Ain't nobody know about the code 'cept me,
Chris, Monk an' Cheese...

380
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,500
An' we all locked up behind this.

381
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
No one else even have a phone.
Not even Snoop.

382
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,000
- No one 'cept the supply.
- You trust the supplier?

383
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,600
Well, someone knew and someone told.

384
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
And now they've got your cellphones,
and they're going for a title three.

385
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,000
So they was on our cellphones...

386
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,000
No, the affidavit says the source told them
the date of your re-supply,

387
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,900
they followed Monk and others
to the warehouse, followed him out,

388
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,400
and found the drugs.

389
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,100
They're going to get their title three and they're
saying that by examining Monk's phone,

390
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,400
your phone, and the others,
they're going to prove the conspiracy.

391
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,100
You see? They weren't on a wiretap,
but now they're using

392
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,200
the phones and photographs
to link you all together.

393
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,700
So who knew that there was a re-supply?
Who knew what you all were up to yesterday?

394
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,300
- Snoop.
- And you trust her?

395
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,700
Who else?

396
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,300
Known sex offenders, Southern district.
Three possibles.

397
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,800
- You want us to sit on them?
- A day or two. Yeah.

398
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,500
- If nothing shows, then we'll move on...
- OK.

399
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,500
Dead and homeless.

400
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Jack Street in Brooklyn.
Christeson's down there.

401
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,700
- Strangle?
- Sounds like a beating, actually.

402
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,500
- Red-ribbon tied around the wrist?
- Actually, it was more of a burnt sienna

403
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,300
and it was lashed around his dick.
Fuck do I know? Get down there.

404
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Jay, this doesn't sound like...

405
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,300
Waste of your time, huh?

406
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,400
That what you have seen here today

407
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,900
is indicative of the progress that city schools
are making under this current administration.

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
Now I know the governor has had
some harsh things to say

409
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,400
about Baltimore schools, but I find that to be
cynical and disappointing.

410
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,500
The 15-point jump in third-grade test scores
is a trend that can't be ignored.

411
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,000
But we've seen third grade scores rise before,
Mr. Mayor.

412
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,000
And it doesn't seem as if any gains
in that grade can be sustained

413
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,300
into fifth and seventh-grade scores.

414
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,600
Kathy, you know, we are committed
to substantive change in Baltimore.

415
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,300
The kids that you saw today
in this citywide debate...

416
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,800
They are achieving at a high school level

417
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,100
and disproving any negative stereotypes
about the city school system.

418
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Could you excuse me for a moment, please?

419
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,000
- Major Colvin.
- Just Colvin.

420
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,300
You know, I always wanted to say
how sorry I am how things turned out.

421
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,300
There wasn't anything I could have done with
your experiment in the Western district.

422
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,100
There wasn't anything that anyone
could have done with that.

423
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Yeah, well, I guess, Mr. Mayor...

424
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,400
There's nothing to be done.

425
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Mr. C., you know the mayor, too? Dag.

426
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,100
I can't even believe I'm talking to you, Gus.

427
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,300
After that shit you pulled.

428
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,700
That's how you all do. Slam somebody
an' then come back the next day

429
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
like it never happened.

430
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,000
It's jus' bidness, Nerese.

431
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It was your turn to read about yourself.

432
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,400
Now, if Carcetti's governor
and you become mayor...

433
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,900
Is Bond gonna run against ya?
Or is he done?

434
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,600
- What do you think?
- After the Clay Davis farce...

435
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,900
He smells like he's done to me.

436
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,400
- There's rumor that Keiffer wants the job, too.
- I'll deal with that as it comes.

437
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,900
What about this Daniels fella?

438
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,100
You think he's ready to run the copshop?

439
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
It's kinda ugly the way he put a knife
to Burrell like that. I mean...

440
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
I read that and wondered
where the hell you people got it from.

441
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
What do you mean?

442
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,000
I was behind Burrell until the moment I wasn't.

443
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,700
And if he had someone backstabbing him
at City Hall...

444
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,100
I'd've heard about it.

445
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Daniels wasn't even on my radar.

446
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,400
Daniels didn't undercut Burrell?

447
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,200
At the end, after his name was floated, Daniels
went around saying he didn't want the job.

448
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,500
Talk about it.

449
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
Well, he's been beat pretty good,

450
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,900
but I've got neck bruising too,
so it could be an attempted strangle.

451
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,500
- No ribbon?
- Nope.

452
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
- Bite marks?
- Not that I can see.

453
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,000
- This fuckin' guy stinks.
- He probably evacuated.

454
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
- What? He left and he came back?
- No, he shit himself.

455
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,800
It's not my guy. Sorry, rook.

456
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,300
He's all yours.

457
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,600
Does the governor think that's a problem,
something that needs addressing?

458
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,400
Hold on a sec...

459
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,200
You got the military records from the Marines?

460
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,100
Three weeks at least, they said.

461
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Sorry about that.

462
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,400
Hey Steven, I gotta little problem.

463
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Well, it's common in men your age.

464
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,600
I need to get into Walter Reed.
I gotta talk to a vet down there.

465
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,300
The fella that was with our homeless vet
when he saw that firefight.

466
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,800
The one Templeton was writing about.

467
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,500
- Why go back on that?
- I just want to talk to a guy.

468
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,600
Homeless fella gave me the name,
said he's in-patient down there.

469
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,100
After the Post series blew up
Walter Reed's shit?

470
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
If you tell them you're a journalist,
you're dead to them.

471
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,500
I know. You know
somebody down there, right?

472
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,200
Not at the hospital.
A neighbor of mine is with AW2.

473
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
- What?
- The army's Wounded Warrior program.

474
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,100
She could get you in, if you're not actually
writing a piece.

475
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
- I'm not.
- What are you doing, Gus?

476
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Scratching an itch.

477
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,800
- I do miss the shift-change parties.
- No, you don't.

478
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,900
You never missed a fucking one of them.

479
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,200
That was one sweet bust you
people put on Marlo Stanfield.

480
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,000
My number, right? I mean, it definitely
smells like a Lester Freamon wiretap.

481
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,500
I watched the news,
all that dope on the table.

482
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,600
I swear, Carv, I was fully erect.

483
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,500
Your dick got hard? How could you tell?

484
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,900
'Cause the head was poppin' out
of the back of your neck.

485
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,500
Seriously, it was a wiretap, right?

486
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,000
Seriously, I couldn't fuckin' tell you
if I knew, Herc.

487
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,300
What're you saying?
My phone number wasn't shit?

488
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,500
What do you want me to fuckin' say, Herc?
You're the tits.

489
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Without your little contribution,

490
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,600
the whole fucking city
slips into the Chesapeake Bay.

491
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,200
Better?

492
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,800
So you grew up there?

493
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,100
When did your family move to Baltimore?

494
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,200
Reginald. You down there?

495
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,100
- Yes.
- Come to the steps.

496
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
Got a coupla things for you.

497
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,800
Soap, deodorant and the like.

498
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,500
Appreciate that. Usin' the washing basin
to clean up.

499
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,400
And to pee in.

500
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Don't worry, I rinse it out.

501
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,900
I was wonderin'... I got this anniversary
comin' up, at the meetin' place.

502
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,500
Sometimes kin folk come along
to show support.

503
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,700
I was wonderin',
maybe you could...

504
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,100
It's hard for me to make plans
with my schedule at the hospital.

505
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,700
We got a little celebration after.
Thinkin' I could cook us some dinner.

506
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
I mean wouldn't be a fancy thing,

507
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,200
mac and cheese, like that,
but I guarantee it'll be good to you.

508
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
We'll see.

509
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,500
OK.

510
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
My sister. She good people.

511
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,100
Been through a lot though, you know?

512
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,900
- Levy.
- 'Scuse me?

513
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,200
- Levy. The lawyer.
- I know who he is.

514
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm not looking for any lawyers.
I'm following the money.

515
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,500
Follow the lawyers.
Levy, Bronfman, Silverstein, Cray...

516
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
All those guys who take
the high-end drug work.

517
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,400
They don't just make money
off the criminal fees.

518
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,100
- How's he...
- The lawyers?

519
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,000
They make a path
for all this street-corner money.

520
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,300
They showin' all these kingpin motherfuckers
how to send it overseas, bring it back,

521
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,900
Invest the shit.

522
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
They the ones who these ignorant
ghetto motherfuckers always listen to

523
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
when it comes to cash money.

524
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,700
And Levy, man, he got the most grease.

525
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,700
So Levy routes it through who?

526
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,900
Anyone who got a project
or a game in need of cash.

527
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,800
Developers, people lookin' to capitalize,
elected folk like myself.

528
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,700
There's a lotta people
need a dollar now an' then...

529
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,500
And the lawyers take their cut.

530
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,400
On both ends, though I got to say,

531
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,000
he gonna let you rob
one of his clients only so much.

532
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,500
I mean once you get a Barksdale
or a Joe Stewart on the hook,

533
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
you want to go deep on they ass.

534
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,300
Levy'll let you get a taste,
but he won't let you run wild.

535
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,600
'Cause once you get past these motherfuckin'
lawyers, you can really play the pimp.

536
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,200
This one time, I had this fella named Bell

537
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,400
hooked up on this Howard Street condo thing.

538
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,900
Got him so that he wasn't runnin' his shit
past the lawyer...

539
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,700
Boy, I tell you, we bled that motherfucker...

540
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,700
Lawyers, huh?

541
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,700
Most definitely, detective.

542
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Me? Shit, I'm just small potatoes.

543
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,800
Just a workin' politician
from Walbrook Junction,

544
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,000
tryin' to make his way
from this world into the next.

545
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,600
What else can you give me on Levy?

546
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,600
Nothin' other than what I have.
I ain't up in his business or nuthin'.

547
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,700
- I just takin' what he throws.
- Bullshit.

548
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,000
You got something solid or I'm on my way
to the US Attorney.

549
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,900
You ain't nuthin' but a shakedown artist.

550
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,400
How's this...

551
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,900
Levy got someone at the courthouse.

552
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,400
Oh, hell yeah.

553
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,200
Levy been buyin' papers for years and
sellin' 'em to whoever needs an early look.

554
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
And don't think there ain't
no real money in that.

555
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,000
- A prosecutor?
- I don't have a name.

556
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Truly I don't,
but it seems to me, you start lookin'

557
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,600
at the people hangin' around the grand jury,
you'll find I'm right.

558
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,800
Now I know I've said enough
to buy my case back.

559
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,300
You know, you could buy a round, too.

560
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,900
I get you?

561
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,000
Nah, feels good, Hubert.

562
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
You dig in there, you got a mind to.

563
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
You admiring my hand, sir?

564
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,300
Oh, call me Gus.

565
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
It's hard to get out the habit.

566
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,000
- That's pretty damn lifelike.
- Yeah.

567
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Prosthetic digits. Five of 'em,
individually controlled.

568
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,500
I got my key grip...

569
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,600
And my power grip...

570
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,000
My precision grip...

571
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,300
And my index point.

572
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,200
These new models got a thumb that rotates,
which makes all the difference.

573
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,900
Used to be you just had this one grip,
right here for everything.

574
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,200
- You got your...
- Not yet.

575
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
- Brave new world.
- Yeah.

576
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,800
Do you mind if I?

577
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,400
The A.W.2 lady says
you weren't writin' no story.

578
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,600
No, I'm just verifying details of one
we already printed in my newspaper.

579
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,200
Profile of your buddy.

580
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,400
Terry.

581
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,300
Yeah, he come down
visit me every coupla weeks.

582
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,500
He takes that Peter Pan bus
down from Baltimore.

583
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,200
Walks a couple of miles down Georgia Avenue
from the Silver Spring terminal.

584
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,300
He's having some trouble as you know.

585
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,300
Did you read the article?

586
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,500
Yeah.
Man who wrote it got some stuff right.

587
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,500
Terry was pissed, I tried to play it off,

588
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,200
make him good with it.

589
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,400
What did the story get wrong?

590
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
Well, that day wasn't
no Black Hawk Down thing.

591
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
You know, when shit went bad...

592
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
After I lost my hands,
them Habudabi motherfuckers

593
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,400
weren't even around after the shit went off.

594
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,200
That's how they do.

595
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
- How you doin', marino?
- Outstanding.

596
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,500
Let me ask you this.
Could Terry have exaggerated?

597
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,800
Why not?
If he got wound up say...

598
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,400
You lie about combat
because you weren't there.

599
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,800
And Terry was. Two tours.

600
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,000
He's got stories if he wants 'em.
Just not on that day.

601
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,400
He ain't lie, y'all did, sorry t'say.

602
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,900
Kima, what the fuck are you taking about?

603
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm sayin' you made a mistake letting McNulty

604
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
run your people from one case to the other.

605
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,900
Why? What's the big deal?

606
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,000
Their run sheets, office reports.
McNulty covered them, right?

607
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
So fuckin' what?
They did police work.

608
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,400
They did good fuckin' police work, in fact.

609
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,800
Your guys...

610
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,100
You coach 'em good, Ellis.

611
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,200
You let them know when I.I.D. Comes callin'
that their answer is

612
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,600
that they didn't know anything about it,

613
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,700
that they did what they were told,
they turned in clean run sheets,

614
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,700
and they don't know what anyone else sent
upstairs for staff review.

615
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,600
Know about what?

616
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,300
When you spoke up on Colicchio
how did that feel?

617
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,700
- Like shit.
- You OK with it?

618
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,300
It was a forced move.
Tony was around the bend.

619
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,200
But are you OK with it?

620
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,100
...Q Jams. The most hip-hop and R&B.
It's your girl Neke here...

621
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,600
We got our peoples in the street.

622
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,200
They big, they fat, and they gorgeous.
What up, Porkchop?

623
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,900
What's up, Neke, it's your boy Porkchop...

624
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,200
We just gonna sit.

625
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,800
I should cut it. With what they charge
at the pump, don't make sense to idle.

626
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,300
- You can go.
- Where to?

627
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Sayin' you can leave the car with me.

628
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,600
You rent by the night, right?

629
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,500
I ain't seen no medium of exchange.

630
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,200
Look, when you done, leave my short
on the street where I pick you up at.

631
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,700
Oh, my God. Look at this.

632
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,400
- Bubs.
- Walon, man...

633
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,300
This here's my boy Fletcher.
Newspaper writer been followin' me 'round.

634
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,000
You're welcome to sit in.
But I have to ask that you respect the privacy.

635
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,500
No notetaking, no recorders,
what you hear today stays in the room.

636
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,700
Not a problem.
I'm just here with Reginald.

637
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,700
I'm his fuckin' sponsor and I don't believe
I ever got a Christian name out of him.

638
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,300
- Reginald. Hot shit.
- See what you done?

639
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,400
- What, man?
- Come on.

640
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
My name is...

641
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,500
My name is...

642
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Reginald.

643
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,500
- Round the way they call me Bubbles.
- Hey, Bubbles.

644
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,300
I'm a drug addict.

645
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,100
Celebratin' my anniversary.

646
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,700
My people couldn't make it here tonight.

647
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,000
I left a trail of fire behind me.

648
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Time gonna make it right with them, I guess.

649
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,400
That's right, it will.

650
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,100
Same thing get me right with myself.

651
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,100
Coupla days ago,
I took a walk down in Druid Hill Park,

652
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,100
right when the sun was goin' down.

653
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,400
You know how that time be like,
with the sun throwin' shadows an' all.

654
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,700
Got me thinkin' 'bout when I was a young man,
sittin' in that park.

655
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,900
You know, watchin' the girls,
smokin' on a little herb, drinkin' a cold beer.

656
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
You know where this is goin'.

657
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,900
I had this moment where, you know,
I was wantin' to feel that way again.

658
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,500
I remembered, what y'all said,

659
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
if the urge was to come,
call a group member up and talk.

660
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,000
First thing I called Walon up,
him bein' my sponsor an' all,

661
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,700
turns out he's on a ride
with his motorcycle club.

662
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,200
So I pulled out that sheet
that got passed out...

663
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,600
Dialed a few numbers,
couldn't get an answer.

664
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,400
I left a coupla messages,
but nobody called me back.

665
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,400
You didn't call me.
'Cause I would have got up with you, Reginald.

666
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,600
You can believe that.

667
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,500
Obliged.

668
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,500
Well, anyway...

669
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,900
I didn't get high.

670
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,100
See, I knew if I did I wouldn't get that
good feelin' back that I was daydreamin' on.

671
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,200
That's right.

672
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,200
It got me thinkin' about a friend of mine...

673
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,200
Boy named Sherrod.

674
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,200
I been carryin' his passin' for a long while.

675
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,500
Like that memory I had
about those summer days in the park.

676
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,900
Thinkin' on that make me smile.

677
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,100
With Sherrod, it's more of a hurt.

678
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,600
But not as...
Not so bad like it was.

679
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,700
Ain't no shame in holdin' on to grief.

680
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,300
As long as you make room
for other things, too.

681
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,500
It's all right.

682
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,000
So thank you for listening.

683
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,500
- Thank you for lettin' me share.
- Thanks for sharing.

684
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,200
Where my gun?

685
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,300
In the trap. You get it when we set up.

686
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,000
A detective is here to see you.
Greggs, I think she said.

687
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,000
What? What's the matter?

688
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,100
How you all even know if Walter behind
everybody gettin' jacked?

689
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,900
I mean, ain't you all ever wonder
if he even deserve any of this shit?

690
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,600
Deserve got nuthin' to do with it.
It's his time, that's all.

691
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,900
Yo, pull over in that alley right there.
I gotta piss sumpin' fierce.

692
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,200
You better piss in that cup
right there on the floor.

693
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,000
Man, I'm gonna need ten cups.
Yo, pull over, Snoop.

694
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,200
What now, motherfucker? You shy?

695
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,900
Smart nigger. You always was.

696
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,300
How you know?

697
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,100
Y'all taught me. Get there early.

698
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,500
Why? What I do wrong?

699
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,000
Chris locked up behind
somethin' he done for you.

700
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,000
- You downtown with the police.
- I ain't say a word.

701
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,100
Yeah, that's what you say.
But it's how you carry yourself.

702
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,900
Always apart. Always askin'
why you should be doin' what you told.

703
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,200
You was never one of us.
You never could be.

704
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,500
How my hair look, Mike?

705
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
You look good, girl.

706
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,500
They're sayin' the only O.T. that anyone
has been seeing has been

707
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,000
through getting detailed
on the homeless killings.

708
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,200
- They say that's the case.
- And no wiretaps up?

709
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,300
I asked about that.
And I'm hearing, off-the-record kinda,

710
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,300
that it was a wire.

711
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,500
And it makes sense,
'cause that's how Lester works.

712
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,900
He gets hold of a number
and works it to death.

713
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,600
Where he would get the number
I have no idea...

714
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,700
But a wiretap is hours, and you say no one
is making any money...

715
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,100
Fuckin' department's more fucked up
than even I remember it.

716
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,300
Where you been at, Mike?

717
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,000
You gotta see this. There's a serial killer,
but he only be killin' other serial killers...

718
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,300
- Yo, yo. We about take a ride.
- You ain't got no whip.

719
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,400
Just gather your stuff.
Come on, we gotta move quick.

720
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,800
- Come on. Let's go!
- OK.

721
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But that means...
All the calls to the newspaper.

722
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,200
The photographs of the missing man.

723
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,200
- We have a wiretap. McNulty has a...
- On a cellphone.

724
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,700
Jesus Christ.

725
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,400
- He wouldn't dare.
- What's the number?

726
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,900
It's on the paperwork...

727
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,700
- Come on.
- Where...

728
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,600
Evidence control.

729
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,800
I always thought you were bullshittin'
'bout havin' an aunt out here.

730
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,600
She expectin' him.

731
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,600
An' what's in this box.

732
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,700
It's nice here, huh?

733
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,900
Let's go, Bug.

734
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,700
Wish I was going with you.
You gonna have your own room.

735
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:23,500
She probably got one of them
plasma TVs, too. Them joints is wet.

736
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,000
Let's go.

737
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,900
OK, give that to Aunt Carla.

738
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,800
Tell her there's more behind it
when she finds the need.

739
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,000
A'ight?

740
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,700
Make sure she cop you some fresh things, too.

741
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't need you going
to a new school lookin' all...

742
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,400
Come on, now.
A man don't be sheddin' no tears.

743
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,800
Go on, Bug.

744
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,900
Bring it up front for re-seal
when you're through, would ya, sir?

745
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,100
Thanks, Augie.

746
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,900
- Glad you landed OK.
- Yeah.

747
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,400
Beats workin'.

748
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,400
Why here?

749
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,000
Why you wanna mix with their kind, man?

750
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,700
They give me work.

751
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,400
Who you talkin' to?

752
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,400
I know what they be doin' in there, Duke.

753
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,900
I could still hang with you, then.

754
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,600
You know I'm too hot.

755
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,500
You remember that one day, summer past?

756
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,500
When we threw them piss balloons
at them terrace boys.

757
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,300
You remember?
Just before school started up again...

758
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,600
Y'know, I took a beatdown from them boys,

759
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
I don't even throw a shadow on it.

760
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,000
That was a day...

761
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,900
Y'all bought me ice cream off the truck.

762
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,000
You remember, Mike?

763
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,600
I don't.

764
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,800
See you 'round, Mike.

765
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,200
See you, Duke.
