1
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,682
Yo, Renaldo!

2
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,643
- Renaldo!
- ¿Qué?

3
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,271
Next time you finish up the box,
you need to holler on it, yo.

4
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,814
Sí, sí.

5
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,567
Mamma mia.

6
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,150
Hey, y'all, it's Omar.

7
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,656
- Omar.
- There he is.

8
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,159
- Omar step, yo.
- Omar, yo.

9
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,764
Y'all ain't got no Honey Nut?

10
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,849
Whatever you see.

11
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,522
And a carton of Newports.

12
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,857
Omar comin'.

13
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,443
Hey, y'all, here he come.

14
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,118
Omar, Omar.

15
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,870
Omar strollin'.

16
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,218
They don't have the Honey Nut?

17
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,015
I don't even want this, dawg.

18
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,309
Why not?

19
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,563
It ain't what you're taking,
it's who you taking it from, you feel me?

20
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,068
How you expect to run
with the wolves come night

21
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,322
when you spend all day
sporting with the puppies?

22
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,084
When you walk through the garden

23
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,086
Watch your back

24
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,589
Well I beg your pardon

25
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,425
Walk the straight and narrow track

26
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,553
If you walk with Jesus

27
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,347
He'll save your soul

28
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,977
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

29
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,230
He's got fire and the fury

30
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,566
At his command

31
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,027
Well, you don't got to worry

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,279
Hold on to Jesus' hand

33
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,199
We'll be safe from Satan

34
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,952
When the thunder rolls

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,205
But you gotta keep the devil

36
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,957
Down in the hole

37
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,047
Oh yeah, mm

38
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,637
We'll be safe from Satan

39
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,226
Gotta keep the devil

40
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,020
Down in the hole

41
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,108
- Keep him in the hole
- In the hole

42
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,860
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

43
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,697
- Keep him in the hole
- Keep him in the...

44
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,074
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,243
- Keep him in the hole
- Keep him in the...

46
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
- Down in the hole
- Down in the hole

47
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,015
- So you staying with Royce, I see?
- What you mean?

48
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,435
Oh, man.

49
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,314
Makes sense since I know
you got your fill of Carcetti.

50
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,900
They've been puttin' up
a crop of these things

51
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,153
on every lawn on the block.

52
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,827
And as fast as I take 'em down,
they bring more.

53
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,912
That's what they do this time of year.

54
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,415
I see you're at your leisure.

55
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,793
I work two nights a week,

56
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,130
three day shifts and no weekends.

57
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,383
I'm off till this afternoon.

58
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,469
You're good with it?

59
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,972
It ain't the Hopkins gig, but it'll do.

60
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:34,727
Pullin' 52, good bennies,
got a take-home car.

61
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,856
I mean the hotel manager's
a pain in the ass, but still.

62
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,151
Well, if you was a bit free,
I heard something.

63
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,238
This thing over at University
of Maryland School of Social Work -

64
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,700
- they got a grant. Big money.
- Just stop.

65
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,620
Half a million to look at
repeat violent offenders.

66
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,830
Clinical intervention, all that mess.

67
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,166
So they gonna study some shit, huh?

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,587
Melvin, I had me a good helping
of them downtown, tie-wearing,

69
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,674
come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well
college types last year.

70
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,136
You sure? Cos I sold 'em on it,
should you want it.

71
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,639
Bunny, you're a big man
down on the campus.

72
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,766
You the police that legalized it.

73
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,684
The college boys loved that mess.

74
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,686
Nobody else did, though.

75
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,024
Well, I tried.

76
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,194
You did.

77
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,615
Yo, blacktops, pandemic.

78
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,496
Pandemic, got that pandemic.

79
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,289
Pandemic.

80
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,630
My mack, pandemic,
blacktops right here.

81
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,140
That's my boy, right?

82
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,350
Ain't taking no handouts,
but he workin' for it.

83
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,602
See what I mean?

84
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,814
This nigger's made
a little something out of this corner.

85
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,360
Now hold on, son.
We're just talking now.

86
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,781
- All right?
- Man, y'all did good with this spot.

87
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,409
You a rightful hustler.

88
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,412
What's your name again, man?
Boney? Biddy?

89
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,914
- What's it now?
- You know my name.

90
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,292
Yeah, but now here's the thing.

91
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,169
With this spot all built up and shit,

92
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,005
we need it, yo. Yeah.

93
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,923
- What?
- Two choices -

94
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,885
you can start taking our packages
or you can step off.

95
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,012
My man Chris
is gonna holler at you, all right?

96
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,097
You tell him what it need to be.

97
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,894
Don't wait for the pandemic.
It's right here, y'all.

98
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,104
Don't sleep on the pandemic.

99
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,235
I want to know more
about that boy right there.

100
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,487
Got good signs on him.

101
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,115
Big paws on a puppy, huh?

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,409
Yeah, big paws on a puppy.

103
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,036
To a T.

104
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,079
Get that blacktop before you flop.

105
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,207
Get that pandemic.

106
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,876
The truth is we don't know why he was killed.

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,462
It could have had to do
with him being a witness

108
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,173
or it could be unrelated.

109
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,009
Now, whoever leaked that shit
to Carcetti's camp,

110
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,847
- they lied on us.
- Yeah, well, that's it.

111
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,018
Eight points -
close as Carcetti gets.

112
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,021
He wants to go big dick with me?

113
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,606
I'll show him one he can't handle.

114
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,234
We put it out there,

115
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,071
anyone contributing to both sides
gets frozen out of my next term.

116
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,907
- No one rides the middle anymore.
- Done.

117
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,954
Next, I want DPW and HCD out there today

118
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,039
tearing down all Carcetti's signs.

119
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,584
Any lamppost, median,
any city-owned buildings,

120
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,337
unless the homeowner's
out there arguing, tear it down.

121
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,048
- Done.
- Third, I want Transport

122
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,550
camped outside of
Carcetti's headquarters.

123
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,638
Any car, any violation,
the meter flag goes up,

124
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,266
- inspection sticker - tow it.
- Done.

125
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,019
Next, you two, slow it down.

126
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,900
Nothing else comes out about that murder
until after the primary.

127
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,444
And I want both of you
to go to the press

128
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,072
and talk down that witness angle.

129
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,908
Take the full weight either way it goes.

130
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,161
Clarence, I'm running dead even
with Bond right now.

131
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,832
How are you gonna be running,
I drop you from the ticket?

132
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,336
OK, that's it. Thank you, gentlemen.

133
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,130
Go to it. Now.

134
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,965
Mr. Mayor.

135
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,313
- What?
- Carcetti has a point.

136
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,817
I went down to Annapolis,
got matching funds for witness protection.

137
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,987
You didn't earmark a dime
to put 'em into play.

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,991
- Next fiscal year.
- Don't claim poverty on this.

139
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,701
We're only talking a quarter of a million.

140
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,040
I match those funds now and that
motherfucker's got a campaign highlight -

141
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,001
"Tommy Carcetti expands
witness protection program.

142
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,421
"Fought for and won extra funds."
Hell with that!

143
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,216
I go after that state-match funds
after the election.

144
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,419
Nah, I paid for three pills.

145
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,879
Look, blue shirt gets two.

146
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,131
- Nah, I get two.
- White shirt gets one.

147
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,509
- Cheatin' motherfucker.
- I get four.

148
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,221
Look, blue shirt gets two,
white one, no shirt one.

149
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,681
Y'all can take
what y'all paid for and walk away

150
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,351
or just walk away with nothing.
Motherfuck a refund.

151
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,478
No, nigger, I paid for three.

152
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:14,191
You need to rethink what putting
a hand on me's gonna get you.

153
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:18,445
You can thank your friend here
for snatching away y'all highs.

154
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,156
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up.
Can I get my two?

155
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,791
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

156
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,545
You don't rattle. Yo, you come up
under my wing, young'un,

157
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,880
you ain't gonna do nothin' but rise.

158
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,592
- I don't know why you thinkin' about quittin'.
- Look, man, like I already told you,

159
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,178
I'm all the way repaid,
and tomorrow's school.

160
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,515
Come on, man, what the fuck
do you want to go to school for?

161
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,560
What do you want to be?
An astronaut?

162
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,020
A dentist? A pay lawyer, nigger?

163
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,607
Look, check it out.

164
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,985
Why don't you just come
down here after school

165
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,530
and just work these rush hours for me?
How about that?

166
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,964
Hey, hey!

167
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,514
Thank you. I know that kind of money...

168
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,811
I said I know that kind of money
doesn't come easy to anyone.

169
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:37,399
No, it's just something on my end,
some construction or something... Right.

170
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,735
Yeah, right. Thanks again.

171
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,490
Two hours, 30 grand.
Am I getting the hang of this or what?

172
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,992
What the fuck is that?

173
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,245
DPW's tearing up the sidewalk
right outside our door.

174
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,748
You really pissed him off.

175
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes, I did, didn't I?

176
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,002
Come on.
Door-to-door in Irvington.

177
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,464
- Right.
- And we got that dead witness tonight.

178
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,069
Yeah. Federal?

179
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,405
Nah, she ain't no federal.

180
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,115
That there a city girl.

181
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:32,371
I like shorty too. She all right...
long as she don't get in my way.

182
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,293
Re-up right there.

183
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,212
Por qué?

184
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,881
School ain't starting till tomorrow, right?

185
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,676
The little one'll be all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

186
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,719
You know it too, don't you, girl?

187
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,099
The camera.
If you go in front, they...

188
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,561
They're supposed to know it's me.
I'm my own trademark. You feel me?

189
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,229
But if they know it's you...

190
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,565
What, you scared on bein' made, huh?

191
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,650
Claro que sí.

192
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,279
How 'bout I put you
in a full-body bunny suit?

193
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,323
You'd be like a six-foot rabbit
putting a pistol in their face.

194
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,926
Let me get a pack of Juicy Fruit.

195
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,773
You look like one of them
half-soul, half-Chinese types

196
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,859
from Vietnam and shit.

197
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,448
Come again now, Mama-san.

198
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,468
Patience, girl.

199
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,386
More patience.

200
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,640
The guy drives a shit box.

201
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,810
He's got a two-bit minimart
but the back door in there is reinforced steel

202
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,813
and the security camera
on the street is high-end.

203
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,067
Not only that, but I think
I made the re-up today.

204
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,362
- Schoolgirl with a heavy backpack.
- Mm.

205
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,074
Well, I pulled Andre's phone history
trying to find Marlo's organization,

206
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,451
cross-referencing DNRs to other cells.

207
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,955
This is Fruit, this is Monk, and there's
three or four other good probables.

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,958
Not likely to find a direct line
to Marlo that way.

209
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,960
Andre had to go through Monk
to get to him.

210
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,630
No, but we might get
a cell on Chris Partlow,

211
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,799
or for Toad, or for one of the top lieutenants.

212
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,009
We're gettin' close.

213
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,137
Deputy pulled me downtown.
You guys aren't into any shit, are you?

214
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,056
No, sir.

215
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,813
Good he wasn't down at the ocean today.

216
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,775
And the subpoenas?

217
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,444
You won't see a page of anything
until after the primary.

218
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,781
After that, if a document lands
and there's no one there to read it,

219
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,575
will the mayor and his people
honestly give a shit?

220
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,038
Other than that, what can I tell you
except to get that unit back on the street?

221
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,878
Lieutenant, you are relieved
from command of Major Crimes.

222
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,715
You've done exceptional work,
and in light of that,

223
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,093
we want you to improve
another vital aspect of our mission.

224
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,220
- Sir?
- Telephone Reporting Unit.

225
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,223
You report there tomorrow, 0800.

226
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,435
Have I done something wrong?

227
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,271
Lieutenant Marimow
will be taking over Major Crimes.

228
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,399
If you need to brief him, do so promptly.

229
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,944
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,613
Jimmy, how's that
beach house coming?

231
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,825
Beach...
Um, fine, sir...

232
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,161
Great. Sounds great.

233
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,672
Hand me the colander, will you?

234
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,926
He's early.

235
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,012
You get the door, I'll do that.

236
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,932
- Hey!
- Hey!

237
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,684
Come in.

238
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,438
- Ooh, smells good.
- Spaghetti, nothing fancy.

239
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,898
- Côtes du Rhône?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,026
The sommelier
behind the Plexi said it was dry.

241
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,320
- Hey, Beadie!
- Hey, Bunk, how you doing?

242
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,947
Whoa, look at you!
Blonde and all.

243
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,492
- You like it?
- I do, I do.

244
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,286
- Hey, kids.
- This is Jack, that's Cary.

245
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,497
- This is Detective Moreland.
- Hi!

246
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,957
- Call me Bunk.
- Let me open this wine.

247
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,293
Yeah, that's right.
Let that shit breathe.

248
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,546
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

249
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,673
- That's all right. They hear worse.
- Yeah, no doubt.

250
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,467
So, you want ice in yours?

251
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,969
No, man, that's a double-digit vino.

252
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,388
- Even has a cork.
- Swell.

253
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,977
- I like your binders.
- Thanks!

254
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,146
McNulty gave them to us.

255
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,606
- McNulty?
- Yeah.

256
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,982
- Not Jimmy?
- No.

257
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,318
Uncle Jimmy? Jim?

258
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,444
- No.
- No?

259
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,904
Daddy? Pops?

260
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,739
McNulty.

261
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,450
Oh, just plain McNulty.

262
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,499
And if I take his weak-ass product,
that means I'll be makin' less money.

263
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,127
I only brought life to this strip because
of the good shit that y'all gave me.

264
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:36,883
I'm standing here holding my Charles Dickens
cos I ain't got no muscle, no backup.

265
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,344
Shit, man. Yo, if this was the old days...

266
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,597
Yeah, now, well,
the thing about the old days,

267
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,266
they the old days.

268
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,810
People I'm working with now...

269
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,565
So you want to bump with Marlo
over real estate?

270
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,026
You're on your own.
But if you want my advice...

271
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,612
I don't, man. I don't.

272
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,282
Bodie. Yo, Bodie.

273
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,329
Me? I lost the wholesale
to every crew in Winchester, homes.

274
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,124
Them horses takin' Marlo's shit now.

275
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,044
He pushin' the independents over Hilltop, too.

276
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,881
I lost three crews there this month.

277
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,299
What about the East Side?

278
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,259
There we got a much bigger problem,

279
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,305
all those ugly-ass bitches in Yankee hats
chasin' all the locals away.

280
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,807
I heard them New York boys
ran off most of Delroy's people,

281
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,934
and those that stay
gotta take they package.

282
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,814
Man, all this theorizing
about how it be product, not territory?

283
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,775
You can't talk that shit
if a nigger snatchin' all the territory

284
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,235
an' won't take your product.

285
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,739
See, the thing is
Marlo's only takin' a little bite.

286
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,533
Them New York cats
is like Wal-Mart comin' to town.

287
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,245
Me, personally,
I think it's time Wal-Mart went home.

288
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,081
If we gonna bump with 'em,
it's got to be all of us.

289
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,418
I tell you what, I'd like to see
Marlo with us in on that one.

290
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,087
You know what I mean?
One big Baltimore team.

291
00:20:56,172 --> 00:21:00,342
Yeah, Marlo can make an inconvenient
nigger disappear, can't he?

292
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,471
I heard he got some kinda hookup
at this funeral home in Westport.

293
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,390
Coffin goes in there
needs two pallbearers.

294
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,018
Come out, you need eight
to carry that bitch,

295
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,186
you know what I mean?

296
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,939
Nah. He usin' them shut-up rowhouses.

297
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,525
Dump a body in there,
no one can tell one smell from another.

298
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,738
Well, whatever he doin',
he cold but he ain't stupid.

299
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:27,077
Think it's time to try again
to talk to the boy.

300
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,330
I hope you got better shit to say than Stringer

301
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,917
cos young'un ain't given
no one an ear yet.

302
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,922
Jimmy, you're a domesticated motherfucker.

303
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,133
- Yeah, guess I am.
- Ah, we're good.

304
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,593
How's everything at the port?

305
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,971
- Quiet.
- It's quiet everywhere.

306
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,430
- Even the Western.
- Yeah.

307
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,393
I'm having a hard time with it,
somethin' ain't right.

308
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,978
Enjoy it while it lasts.

309
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,563
- You working something?
- Yeah, I got this one case.

310
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,984
I know who the shooter is
but can't find him.

311
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,360
He'll turn up.

312
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,363
Maybe.

313
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,531
More?

314
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,325
- Oh, mercy. No, ma'am.
- Dessert?

315
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,495
I was thinking
we might go out for a little taste.

316
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,248
Unless you got to tuck in the kids.

317
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,751
- I don't know.
- Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go.

318
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,378
I'll tuck 'em in.

319
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,926
She trusts you.

320
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,345
Yeah.

321
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:37,313
Can't go to dinner without
catching a page, huh? What now?

322
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,734
Her john jumps in the shower.
She rummages his wallet.

323
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,194
He figures it out and beats on her

324
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,448
till the people next door call the front desk.

325
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,555
Sir, if she doesn't have the money on her,

326
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,724
I don't know what I can do.

327
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,018
Did you beat that woman in there?

328
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,394
I just want my money back.

329
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:21,149
Excuse me, Mr. Gergen, I need a moment
with my director of security.

330
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,906
If she presses charges,
I'm cuffin' that motherfucker.

331
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,365
This is a delicate matter.

332
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,450
Delicate shit.

333
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,412
Mr. Gergen represents a national
consortium of convention planners,

334
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,541
and he's been a friend of the hotel...
Mr. Colvin? Mr. Colvin?

335
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,002
Now, you took his cash
and he beat you good, huh?

336
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,880
How much he beat you for?

337
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,343
How much?

338
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,519
Give me the cuffs.

339
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,980
No, Mr. Colvin. I...

340
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,735
What the fuck is this?

341
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,946
She steals my money
and you're gonna lock me up?

342
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,031
You're gettin' charged with assault.

343
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,909
You charge her with the theft,
I'll put the cuffs on her too.

344
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,954
- But you in the wagon, shitbird.
- This is not acceptable...

345
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,290
- No. He's goin' in a wagon.
- Mr. Colvin, I have to insist.

346
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,168
30 years a police officer,
I never took cuffs off a right charge.

347
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,923
- Ain't about to start now.
- You're not a police officer, Mr. Colvin.

348
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,008
You work for us.

349
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,483
Nah, I'm good.

350
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,446
You nursin' that thing like a baby bird.

351
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,534
You know those little corner joints
in the ghetto

352
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,788
that sell subs,
and fried chicken, lake trout?

353
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,875
Lake trout?

354
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,503
Like egg creams in New York.

355
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,796
No eggs, no cream.

356
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,173
Exactly.

357
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,258
No lake, no trout.

358
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,512
They're pogies. Whitefish, trash fish.

359
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,557
Exactly. White trash fish.

360
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,602
"Lake trout." That's all marketing.

361
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,689
It's just all dressed up like something it ain't.

362
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,152
You know what I'm sayin'?

363
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,407
Sometimes it is what it is.

364
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,994
It really is.

365
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,874
That's deep.

366
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,130
- I like the way you think.
- Yeah, you too.

367
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,473
Hold on.

368
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,104
Dang, Bug, if you can tie one shoe,
you can tie the other one.

369
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,147
You hear me?

370
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,692
Cookies all on your face.

371
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,777
Come on.

372
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,242
What up, shorty? Ready for the first day?

373
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,454
Yeah, he can't wait to be
in the third grade. Ain't that right, Bug?

374
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,039
What's up?

375
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,166
Dukie.

376
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,715
Cool.

377
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,103
Look at all these big-ass
eighth graders out here.

378
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,772
Look like some sixth graders
gonna get banked.

379
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,317
Come in here.
I wanna show y'all somethin'.

380
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,651
Go ahead, Bug.

381
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,821
Yo, what up, boy?
That jersey's crazy, son.

382
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,906
Where you get that at?

383
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,960
Yo, check it. This dude in the joint
with my father drew these.

384
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,004
- I'm about to get one on my arm.
- Is this you?

385
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,882
Why would you get yourself?
In case you forget what you look like?

386
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,592
Yo, what do these mean, man?

387
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,387
A'ight, this one means "heart",
like, you know, "He got heart".

388
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,306
- That means "lion."
- How you know?

389
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,974
Word, the dude could be playing you.

390
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,353
Like, this one, instead of heart,
it could mean like bitch or somethin'.

391
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:12,523
And like this one,
it could mean, like, pussy or clown.

392
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,609
Come on, man.
Fuck y'all motherfuckers.

393
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,778
- They probably do, too.
- Get outta my house.

394
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,864
Understand something about me -

395
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:24,702
I may be wearing these bars
but I worked the bricks to earn 'em,

396
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,331
and I am stone-cold police
first, last, and always.

397
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,458
Froze my balls off in the winter,

398
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,127
sweated 'em in the summer,
ran, jumped,

399
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,131
rolled in the dirt
with the bad guys 24/7/365.

400
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,343
Now, I'm a great admirer of this unit.

401
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,553
Avon Barksdale.

402
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,723
That was a 14-point buck you bagged.

403
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,434
However, we are gonna do better.

404
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,146
And if there's a case to be made out there,
we'll make it together

405
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,442
with good work
and good supervision of that work.

406
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:00,446
I want to be briefed every step of the way.

407
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,074
Questions?

408
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,829
No?

409
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,331
Good.

410
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,052
Yo, who you got?

411
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:28,141
I got...Prez... Prez-what?

412
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,811
I got Mrs. Scott.
Fuckin' hate that foul bitch, man.

413
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,188
She ain't that bad.
At least you ain't got Sampson.

414
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,275
- Yeah, I know.
- Yo, Michael, who you got?

415
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,989
Man?

416
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,199
Presborowski... Pres...

417
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,703
Yo, he new and white.
We got it made.

418
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,049
Uh-oh, look at this.

419
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,969
Where is your fine take-home car?

420
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,056
Got took home.

421
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,561
We need to talk.

422
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,796
Sixth grade is on the first floor!

423
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,090
Seventh grade is on the second.

424
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,094
Eighth-grade homeroom
is on the third floor!

425
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,889
Don't go up the down staircase.

426
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,058
Quickly and quietly, people.

427
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,852
I see you, Quantell.

428
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,021
I see you too.

429
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,107
School's getting ready to start. Come on.

430
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,945
Hi, dear. Good to see you back.

431
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,489
Yo, what up, Turner.
You back for more?

432
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,534
Aw, damn, man.
I love the first day, son.

433
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,536
Everybody all friendly an' shit.

434
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,455
Namond Brice.
Already, we're starting?

435
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,089
Damn, man.

436
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,091
Next time, they stay in my drawer.

437
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,218
Yo, whatever, man.

438
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,970
I know, right? Already, son.

439
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,721
Yo, what up?

440
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,849
Damn, man. These kids is crazy, son.

441
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,854
- I know, right?
- We're seventh graders.

442
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,582
Yo, dang. You see Neesy?

443
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,584
Yo, them bitches is on steroids, word.

444
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,712
Word, son.
Send them bitches to Iran.

445
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,797
That shit'd be over in a heartbeat.

446
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,181
OK, check the chart
to see where you're sitting.

447
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,437
Check the chart.

448
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,272
Hi, I'm Randy.

449
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,024
How are you doing, Randy?

450
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,363
Check the chart.

451
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,372
Bunny! Bunny!

452
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,835
OK. Good morning.

453
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,131
OK, good morning.

454
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,134
Yo! Shut up!

455
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,765
Good morning.

456
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,602
I'm your homeroom teacher, obviously.
My name is Mr. Pryzbylewski.

457
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,814
But you can call me Mr. Pryzbylewski.

458
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,322
OK. Let's find out who you are.

459
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,617
This is Ms. Donnelly.

460
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:19,163
We had trouble with first bells, so expect
the class change to ring in one minute.

461
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:23,584
Students will walk, not run,
to classes in an orderly manner.

462
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,338
OK...um...

463
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,048
We'll, uh...

464
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,593
We'll get to know each other
a little later.

465
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,024
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

466
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,526
Latifah.

467
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,071
All right. Sorry.

468
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,578
Where my bus passes at?

469
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:05,042
- Crystal Judkins, you're not listed.
- Crystal? I look like Crystal to you?

470
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,335
I'm Charlene.

471
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,423
- Ronald Parker?
- Heh.

472
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,967
Karim Williams.
Ronald over there.

473
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,387
- Oh, Jeez.
- Um, yo, Mr. Prez,

474
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,556
I need a hall pass for the bathroom.
It's an emergency.

475
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,558
Everyone, I need those bus passes back.

476
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,979
Hold on. Whoa.
Everyone, stay where you are.

477
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,314
Stay where...
I need those passes back.

478
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,983
It's an emergency.
Mr. Prez...

479
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,361
Everyone, I need those bus passes back.
The kids that need them...

480
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,405
- Mr. Prez...
- What? Just take one.

481
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,783
- I need those bus passes back!
- No one leaves this room

482
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:41,412
until Mr. Pryzbylewski
gets those bus passes back.

483
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,831
Do I need to say that twice?

484
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,211
Thank you. Thank you.

485
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,096
You'll get the hang of it.

486
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,619
Come in.

487
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,248
Are you coming in or what?

488
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm coming in, OK?

489
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,973
You asked to see me, sir?

490
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,391
I did.

491
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,529
Seeing as how
I like to know my boys in depth...

492
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,572
why'd you want this unit?

493
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,409
Honestly?

494
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,580
I took the sergeant's test,
scored pretty high but not high enough.

495
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,667
And Lieutenant Hoskins -
we went through the academy together -

496
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,420
he said that this is a good detail
for going up the ladder.

497
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,340
I know you have to do it for a while

498
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,175
but maybe next year,

499
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,094
if I do good here,

500
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,972
they'll reach down for me.

501
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,974
Next year, huh?

502
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,268
For some things, that's a long time to wait.

503
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,022
Excuse me?

504
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,524
I hear you're a good cop.

505
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,069
I also hear you recognize
who your friends are

506
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,696
and that you're loyal to them.

507
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,281
Did I hear all that right?

508
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,907
Absolutely.

509
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,078
Where are you on the list?

510
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,873
32.

511
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,125
They took 15, but...

512
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:56,130
Man, I thought you were gonna say
something like 60, or, you know, 95.

513
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,969
Hey, let me call my man Burrell.

514
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:06,557
No need in wasting good police like you
chauffeuring around politicians.

515
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,184
I don't even know what to say,
Mr. Mayor. This...

516
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,437
This is unexpected.

517
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,606
Don't mention it.

518
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,986
Today being the first day,
let's have some fun.

519
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,196
I'm gonna throw you a little math puzzle,

520
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,991
see if I can get you thinking on your feet.

521
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,911
Andre is leaving Baltimore...

522
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,455
Mr. Prezbo, I need to change my seat

523
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,749
cos this boy here
smells like a garbage can.

524
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,545
You need to work a little
on your compassion skills.

525
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,674
Yeah, and he needs to work a little
on his soap-and-water skills.

526
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,970
All right, like I was saying,

527
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,181
my friend Andre is leaving Baltimore.

528
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,350
He's going 60 miles an hour...

529
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,977
Hey, what side of Baltimore,
east or west?

530
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,689
- It doesn't make any difference.
- That's what you think.

531
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,484
OK, east.

532
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,697
West, OK?

533
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,868
OK. Uh...

534
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,995
And he's going to Philadelphia...

535
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,123
- Man, Philly's ass.
- You think Allen Iverson is ass?

536
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,085
- OK, stop.
- He only play for them, he ain't from there.

537
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,629
I'd never play for the Sixers
no matter how much they pay.

538
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,382
Nigger, they'd pay yo' ass to go away.

539
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,467
Enough!

540
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:30,391
OK, Andre's leaving Baltimore,
West Baltimore, traveling 60 miles per hour.

541
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,519
He's going to Philadelphia,
which is 80 miles away.

542
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,021
- What kind of car?
- He drivin' on I-95,

543
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,775
he need to watch out for the state police.
They be profilin' niggers.

544
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,735
He ain't say Andre was black, yo.

545
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,363
C'mon, Randy.
Andre from the West Side?

546
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,241
- He ain't say he was black.
- Yo, you know he black.

547
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,659
OK.

548
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,327
I said OK!

549
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,706
Mr. Prezbo.
You say he travellin' in a car.

550
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,667
Is he driving or is he, like, in the back seat?

551
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,712
All right, you know what?
Fun is fun...

552
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,380
Hey!

553
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,812
Take your seats! Everybody sit down!

554
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,939
Hey!

555
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,987
Everything OK in here?

556
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,959
Why isn't Officer Massey present?

557
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,087
Working overnight on the wire.

558
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,633
Attendance at all office meetings
is now mandatory. Inform her.

559
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,388
And this Marlo Stanfield?
This the best we can do?

560
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,057
- Sir?
- This is the guy

561
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,267
we're wasting months chasing with a wiretap?

562
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,770
We could be out doing
a dozen other different things.

563
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,521
Stanfield is a comer.

564
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,774
He's got a lot of West Side real estate.

565
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,193
How many bodies on him?

566
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,906
He fought a war against
the Barksdales last year but nothing recent.

567
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,074
Nothing recent?

568
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,743
He owns West Baltimore
but with no bodies?

569
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,412
Maybe it's just me,
but in 18 years out there,

570
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,748
I have never seen
a carnivore eat a carrot.

571
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,249
He's been quiet for a time...

572
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,460
"For a time"?
This city's up to its hips in blood

573
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,588
and you are sitting on one guy with a history?

574
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,257
OK, here's the new world order, guys.

575
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,635
I want good, quick rips.

576
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,596
Six, ten, twelve felony cases a month.

577
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,891
That means no more long-ass wiretaps,
no more subpoenas,

578
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,351
no more mincing around on shit.

579
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,645
We get out on the street
and come back with stats.

580
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,065
The Barksdale case is closed

581
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:47,277
and when the Stanfield wire comes up,
we close that as well. Understood?

582
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,612
The hell with this.

583
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,407
We got a wiretap up, and a judge
decides when it comes down.

584
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,120
Well, Detective,

585
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,373
the Deputy Ops is gonna
talk to you about that.

586
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,019
Table B. Put those cards away.

587
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,729
Kareem Myers. Sit down.

588
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,192
Yo, yo, listen, listen.

589
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,780
Kit Kats a dollar,
Snicker bars a dollar,

590
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,158
Warheads a dollar,
Twizzlers a dollar.

591
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,160
Sour Patch 50 cent, and gum 50 cent.

592
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,378
Anything you can get at the store,
I can get in here for y'all.

593
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,130
Gummy bears?

594
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,339
Ain't a problem.

595
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:53,218
I got Snickers, M&Ms.
Check the price and come holler at me.

596
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,638
I'm doing a three-for-two discount
and I'm taking orders for tomorrow.

597
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:00,392
So, if you want something special,
just come holler at me.

598
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,605
There it is, yo.

599
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,864
Qué pila de mierda.
Why not give me a water pistol?

600
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,950
You just worry about
how we gonna do. It'll play.

601
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,091
Oye, gordo! The package.

602
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,885
Avanza, cabrón.

603
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,971
With that raggedy-ass piece?
Nigger, is you crazy?

604
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,181
Loco or something?

605
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,310
Don't you know the shit is bulletproof?
You don't understand...

606
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,982
You heard what the boy said.

607
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:57,991
An' a box of Newports.

608
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,169
Where my change, yo?

609
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,005
Don't wild me.

610
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,518
Hey, yo, you see the look on his mug?

611
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,063
That's the reason
why we get up every morning.

612
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,777
OK.

613
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,113
OK, OK.

614
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:42,077
Now, Andre's friend Yvonne
is supposed to meet him in Philadelphia.

615
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,162
Yeah. Andre gonna bone that skank.

616
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,999
Can you shut up? Mr. Prezbo
is tryin' to teach us somethin'.

617
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,960
You shut up, bitch.
He ain't teachin' me nothin'.

618
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,421
Yvonne, though, is coming from New York.

619
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,966
So...my question for you is -

620
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,515
A, who arrived in Philly first,

621
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,350
Andre or Yvonne?

622
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,061
And B, by how much time?

623
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,354
Prezbo!

624
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:12,607
And C...

625
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,027
who gives a rat's ass?

626
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,490
With this grant the mandate is not only
to rethink how we utilize institutions

627
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,410
but to help us start getting past
having to rely on jail

628
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,121
and drug rehab as our only responses.

629
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,625
We're looking for a specific target group
to inoculate, epidemiologically speaking...

630
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,712
Doctor, pardon me, I'm not an academic.

631
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:37,132
Not by a long shot, but...

632
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,676
what exactly are you saying here?

633
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,763
He's sayin' he's got a lot of money
to come up with some way

634
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,807
to go at those boys out there
bangin' on the corners.

635
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,642
That's what I mean, yes.

636
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,478
So where do I come in?

637
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:54,733
If the salary is suitable, your duties
would be to perform as a field researcher,

638
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,487
a liaison operating
in the urban environment.

639
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,699
You go out in the 'hood
and get him some corner boys to mess with.

640
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,912
This is why I need somebody
like you to be paired up with me.

641
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,413
I go out there on my own...

642
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:11,500
They sell your tenured ass for parts.

643
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,126
In so many words.

644
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,214
Anyway, um, we're looking
for 18 to 21 -year-olds.

645
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:21,051
This is where we see
the demographic peak in violent behavior.

646
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,220
You excuse us for a minute?

647
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,728
What happens
when you ain't around to translate?

648
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,397
Don't play ignorant on me, Bunny.

649
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,733
You can back-and-forth with any
of these guys. I've seen you work.

650
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:40,904
Besides, it's clear,
you ain't cut out for the private sector.

651
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,781
18 to 21?

652
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,617
By that age they're deep in the game.
He's fucked on that.

653
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,078
So show him.

654
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:52,833
50,000, 80-20 health plan
and a take-home vehicle.

655
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,253
I'd be amazed if they
give you 30, an HMO

656
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,546
and a bus pass.

657
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,297
OK. See you later.

658
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,133
I go in there now,
you know what that makes me?

659
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,844
Some asshole politician
who's running for office.

660
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,099
Watkins. 40th District.

661
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:56,229
- You call the reporters?
- All three channels and The Sun.

662
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,085
My condolences.

663
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,421
- I'm Thomas...
- I know who you are.

664
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,256
Thanks for your respects.

665
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,152
I'm so sorry for your loss.

666
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,072
We shouldn't be here today
just because...

667
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,449
your son came forward as a witness.

668
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,076
What do you mean?

669
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,286
I know it's...

670
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,958
I'm just sorry for your loss, that's all.

671
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:35,704
A parent's worst nightmare. I don't know
how anybody can go on after this.

672
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,747
Yeah, me neither.

673
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,624
Ms. Daniels.

674
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,585
Councilman.

675
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,712
How's things over in the 11th District?

676
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,506
Harder than I'd hoped for.
Even on the mayor's ticket.

677
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,217
Yeah. Eunetta's pretty well entrenched.

678
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,762
Good luck with it, though.
The council sure could use you.

679
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:04,274
Councilman Carcetti,
can you give us a minute?

680
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,526
Look, guys, I'm sorry, you know.

681
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,570
Now's not the time.

682
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,740
I don't really have anything to say.
I'm sorry.

683
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,702
You don't want coverage?
Are you insane?

684
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,207
We'll get time on the 11:00 from the visual
but I start making speeches right here? Now?

685
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:25,211
- How's that gonna look?
- This is pretty fucking lame political theater.

686
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,298
Yeah, well, you know,
that depends on the audience.

687
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,721
This is Shawn Williams.

688
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:39,059
Lieutenant Mello,
please call shift commander.

689
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,312
Boss, you want me to stay?

690
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,397
No. We're good.

691
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,281
So, Shawn...

692
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,075
You police.

693
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,284
He ain't.

694
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,496
Shawn, how old are you?

695
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,414
18. How old are you,

696
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,249
you shiny-head motherfucker?

697
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,714
- You got a sister, Shawn?
- What the fuck you want with my sister?

698
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:13,968
What the fuck's this Chuck E. Cheese
lookin' motherfucker writing?

699
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:20,225
Let's say you hear that
your sister was assaulted.

700
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,061
- Who fuckin' with my sister?
- She wasn't. I'm just saying...

701
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,356
Sayin' what? Why you
fuckin' with my head, motherfucker?

702
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,066
And this bitch is writing again.

703
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,901
- It's a habit.
- Now, what would you do

704
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,612
if you heard your sister
got beat up by some guy?

705
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,118
Which sister? Cos if it's Cherise,
she probably had it coming.

706
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,995
All right, another sister then.

707
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,290
Danielle? I'd fuck that guy up.

708
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,750
I'd fuck his ass shut.

709
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:48,128
- With you in jail.
- I'd get my boy to do it.

710
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,546
What if you didn't have no boy?

711
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,381
I'd get the nigger myself when I get out.

712
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,551
- What if you had a life sentence?
- Then I'll fuckin' escape.

713
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,261
And put that fuckin' pen down

714
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,139
before I shove it up
your motherfuckin' ass.

715
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,060
What if you couldn't escape, Shawn?

716
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,645
Fuck you.

717
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,857
Fuck you.

718
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,152
Would you go to the police?

719
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,739
Just a question.

720
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,874
Son, thanks for being you.

721
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,086
Thanks.

722
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,132
Look, I'm ready to acknowledge that...

723
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,593
18-to-21 might be too seasoned.

724
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,353
How you fixed for juveniles?

725
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,272
Right now? Fresh out.

726
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,150
The van to baby booking just left.

727
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,445
Are you looking for kids in the system
or just kids?

728
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,323
If it's just kids,
you got Douglass around the corner.

729
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,242
High school?
That's what, 15 to 18, right?

730
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,620
Yeah, but I would...

731
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,538
I'd go younger even.

732
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:17,258
- Kima. What's up, girl?
- Are you sure?

733
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,513
Come on. I'm the one
who took you out of the Eastern,

734
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,972
sent you to the show.

735
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,892
You can't come back here,
you too good for a district.

736
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,310
I need a home, Major.

737
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,314
If you need to make a move,
move up or at least lateral.

738
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,108
But a district is you going backwards.

739
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,319
And you don't need to be
under my wing, either.

740
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:40,615
You're gonna be valued
no matter where you land.

741
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,909
Let me talk to people.

742
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,621
I especially liked the timing
for when you flew your paper.

743
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,414
Shrewd.

744
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:52,460
I couldn't see anybody shutting us down,
not with the elections.

745
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,629
What asshole would risk the headline?

746
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,466
But to gut us from the inside out...

747
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,553
Charlie Marimow. My Trojan horse.

748
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,433
And now, let me guess,

749
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:11,521
to save your wire,
you're prepared to go to Judge Davis.

750
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,190
If my memory serves,
this isn't the first time

751
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,234
a Deputy Ops felt the need to bury you.

752
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,027
You have a gift for martyrdom.

753
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,115
I wonder, though,

754
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,993
are your disciples as keen for the cross?

755
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,209
In your final court report,
it would be prudent to tell the judge

756
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,004
the investigation hit a dead end.

757
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,352
I doubt you'll believe it, but...

758
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,439
I respect the effort.

759
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,900
You're a hell of an investigator.

760
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,949
It would be too much to expect you
to serve under Lieutenant Marimow?

761
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,328
The man's a virus.

762
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,665
Homicide, then.

763
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,834
That's you, right?

764
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,588
Yeah.

765
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,010
I know it's hard right now, Detective, but...

766
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,512
try to think on this as a favor.

767
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,999
This seems right.

768
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,210
Yeah.

769
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,964
So, I understand my old unit's gone
to Lieutenant Marimow.

770
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,966
Yes, it has.

771
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,550
So that unit is...

772
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,095
- Yes, it is.
- That's a shame.

773
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,848
I need to ask if you can
take care of my girl Greggs.

774
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,892
She's a good cop looking for a home,

775
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,771
- and I think she'd be a natural homicide.
- Hm.

776
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,065
Well, there was an opening.

777
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,277
Oops. Just filled that last night.

778
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,197
Another fugitive from Major Crimes.

779
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,324
But...

780
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,952
for you, Major...

781
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,162
let me see who I don't love no more.

782
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:41,087
OK, so, if a rocket travels, say,
1,000 miles an hour,

783
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,923
how far does it go in an hour?

784
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,592
Darnell.

785
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,517
Chiquan?

786
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,438
As far as it wants.
I mean, it's a rocket ship, right?

787
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:05,028
- Randy?
- Is this a trick question?

788
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,446
No.

789
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,282
1,000 miles?

790
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,035
On the money.

791
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,370
Oh, Mr. Prezbo, I was gonna say that.

792
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,627
Go ahead, bitch.
Laugh at me now.

793
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,796
Please, please, please!

794
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,467
What? You want some?

795
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,932
You on the fucking floor, bitch.
Laugh at me now.

796
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,059
Hey!

797
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,977
I don't hear shit.

798
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,399
Crystal, have the office call 911
and get the nurse.

799
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,776
Everybody in your seats.

800
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,906
Just lay still. Just lay still.

801
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,913
Just keep putting pressure on it.

802
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,001
You're doing fine.
Chiquan, you're doing fine.

803
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,670
Just hold on for a couple more minutes.

804
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,301
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

805
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,189
You're gonna be all right.
