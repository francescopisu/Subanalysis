1
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,861
You've got to be shitting me.

2
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,072
Oh, shit!

3
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,620
Get out of the way!

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,544
- Driving all crazy.
- Damn.

5
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:17,410
I've got a foot chase on a male.
Maybe 13 years, short, with braids,

6
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,912
in the alleys eastbound from Fulton.

7
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,373
This kid has bailed out! Bail out!

8
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,751
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

9
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,587
- Fuck!
- Officer, what are you doing?

10
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,840
- What, you need bifocals or something?
- What?

11
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,762
- 0-9. I'm responding.
- 16, 200 north.

12
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,722
I'm gonna need your name.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,516
I'm very sorry, ma'am, all right?

14
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,562
Give me that.

15
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:19,555
Them Expeditions are hard to handle.
With a Lexus I wouldn't have no problem.

16
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,732
You little motherfucker.

17
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,527
- You know how many cars you hit?
- What?

18
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,574
- Don't even think of bullshitting.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,004
You know how much
fucking paperwork I got now? Huh?

20
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,966
How many hours of my life you owe me,
you little shit?

21
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,843
Damn, yo! That hurt!

22
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,554
- You think that hurts...?
- No, no!

23
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,889
Ah! Ah!

24
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,433
You're so smart,

25
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,812
- let's see how easy you boost a car now.
- Ah!

26
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,398
Ah! Ahh!

27
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,415
When you walk through the garden

28
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,417
Watch your back

29
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,044
Well I beg your pardon

30
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,797
Walk the straight and narrow track

31
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,384
If you walk with Jesus

32
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,802
He'll save your soul

33
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,474
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

34
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,019
He's got fire and the fury

35
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,813
At his command

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,524
Well, you don't got to worry

37
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,776
Hold on to Jesus' hand

38
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,738
We'll be safe from Satan

39
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,407
When the thunder rolls

40
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,785
But you gotta keep the devil

41
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,913
Down in the hole

42
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,753
Oh yeah, mm

43
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,301
We'll be safe from Satan

44
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,848
Gotta keep the devil

45
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,517
Down in the hole

46
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,813
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,691
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

48
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,027
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

49
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,947
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

50
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,574
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

51
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,576
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

52
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,797
You imagine, Rawls sitting in this chair?

53
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,758
Never happen. In this town? Uh-uh.

54
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,178
Yeah, well, we weren't supposed
to have a white mayor, either.

55
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,390
He already overreached
putting Rawls in charge.

56
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,185
- De-fucking-facto.
- Motherfucker ain't even sworn in,

57
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,065
already he's got feelers out.
He called the deputy chief in Pittsburgh,

58
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,568
friend of mine, promised him pie in the sky.

59
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,865
Shee-it, partner, just show
Carcetti and everybody else

60
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,201
that they already got the man for the job.

61
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,455
They ain't got to look no further.
The indispensable man.

62
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,043
It was Royce holding you back, Ervin.
Now out from under, you shine.

63
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:40,339
Clay, he's saying everything
goes through Bill Rawls.

64
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,801
- Any move I try to make...
- You're still the commissioner, ain't you?

65
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,679
- You give an order, they jump.
- But Carcetti...

66
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:51,475
He gonna fire you? He just showed you
he don't have balls enough.

67
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,105
You just need
to give Carcetti a little something.

68
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,358
Make him start seeing you in a new light.

69
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,318
Like what?

70
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,446
Some police shit. I don't know.

71
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,201
Something that looks good to Carcetti,
so he can say it was his idea to keep you.

72
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,870
Hm.

73
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,329
"Police shit"?

74
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,375
Well, whatever it is y'all do for a living. Look...

75
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,963
just take care of your end
and let your friends handle theirs.

76
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,892
- Good morning.
- I just dropped my stuff in my room,

77
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:38,481
and maintenance and Donnelly are checking
the heat. It must be 80 degrees in there.

78
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,901
- 90-minute classes.
- Excuse me?

79
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,737
This time of year, we go to 90-minute classes.

80
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,492
Concentrated prep in math
and language arts only.

81
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,577
I don't follow. Why the heat?

82
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,122
It's the only way kids will
sit through 90 minutes of anything.

83
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,918
- Make them drowsy?
- Right.

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,753
So it's about the tests.

85
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,799
From now until they're done,
everything's about the tests.

86
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,266
- Damn! I ought to go somewhere warm.
- Plymouth Rock!

87
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:19,647
- Where?
- I saw on Animal Planet, marlin fishing.

88
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,775
Like, Florida, the Bahamas.

89
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,277
That shit looked sweet.

90
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,532
The water was like this...this color, man.

91
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,951
It ain't gonna be that cold this year.

92
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,787
- How you know?
- Global warming.

93
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
So why is it so cold already?

94
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,750
Yo, we just getting old.

95
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,794
Yeah. True that.

96
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,047
Where the fuck you been?

97
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,634
City jail for a day and a half
till they recogged me.

98
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,346
Then my grandma got sick,
so I was over there for a while.

99
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,642
- Po-Po hit you with a charge?
- Just false statement and shit,

100
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,978
for saying I wasn't who I really was.

101
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,356
Damn, so why they was
asking about you like that?

102
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,316
Mm-mm.

103
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,403
- They try talking to you?
- Yeah, about some murder.

104
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,822
- Which one?
- It don't matter which murder,

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,491
because I ain't say shit to them bitches.

106
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,953
Yeah, well, I ain't the one
you need to convince.

107
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,999
Plymouth Rock! Plymouth Rock!

108
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,835
- Why I got to convince him?
- I'm saying, yo.

109
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,257
Po-Po come asking about you,
you out of pocket for a few days.

110
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,718
Yeah. He'll definitely hear about it.

111
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:36,390
I ain't say nothing to nobody. That's why
they dumped my ass in Central Booking,

112
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,559
because I ain't say a fucking word
to none of 'em.

113
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,603
Yeah, so go tell him that shit.

114
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,856
Shit, man, if it were me, I'd go to him first.

115
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah, jump out in front of that.

116
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,029
If they come looking for you,
it looks like you got something to hide.

117
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,822
Definitely.

118
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,783
Ghetto bird special. Two for one.

119
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
What you want?

120
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,913
Menu, yo. Give him a menu.

121
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,794
- What's good?
- Fuck if I know.

122
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,798
You ain't supposed to cuss
at the customer, motherfucker.

123
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,426
- Darnell.
- All right.

124
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,887
Let me get...pizza.

125
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,306
Pizza. Anything to drink?

126
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,849
Grape soda.

127
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,809
Quiet, please.

128
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,437
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,147
Thank you. Say thank you.

130
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,857
Yeah. Thank you.

131
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,400
Menu?

132
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,861
Don't he got to say "thank you," too?

133
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,281
- Darnell.
- Why? He's supposed to give it back.

134
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,619
When you are polite to people,
they treat you better. Have a seat, please.

135
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,164
Now you be the waiter,
and Albert, you be the customer.

136
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,710
What you want to eat?

137
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,547
Some crab cakes and a Coke.
Hurry that shit up, too.

138
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,092
Been on the phone nonstop
with Fourth Avenue.

139
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,011
They insist every class teaches to the test.

140
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,974
- Oh, God.
- I thought we were the exception.

141
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,101
That's the point of the project.

142
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,104
- They know that.
- No exceptions.

143
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,649
90-minute blocks of math
or language arts only.

144
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,777
They can't do 30 minutes
without climbing the walls.

145
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,989
Isn't there somebody
we can talk with, face to face?

146
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:20,577
Actually, the area superintendent
wants to see the two of you tomorrow,

147
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,539
nine o'clock in the conference room.

148
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,714
Let's not panic...yet.

149
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,263
¿Qué es esto?

150
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,902
- Business as usual.
- Marlo.

151
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,574
- You no know him when we robbed the gang?
- We ain't never been introduced.

152
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,744
Boy's merely a name to me.

153
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,002
If you knew it was Marlo,
you'd still go through with it, no?

154
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,839
I wish I'd have known.
I'd have enjoyed it that much more.

155
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,021
Bubs. It's Herc.

156
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,190
You hungry?

157
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,525
Yo, what you done was fucked up, man.

158
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,029
- I felt bad when I heard.
- Not only were you late,

159
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,532
you just rolled right past.
Ain't you see me getting beat?

160
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,078
- We rolled by?
- I seen you with the blue light on, man.

161
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,164
Whatever. Look, we had
a communication problem, I admit.

162
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,877
But I'm gonna get you a phone today.
That's gonna solve it for us. You'll see.

163
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,048
Thing is, there's this camera,

164
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,760
police department video camera,
disappeared a few weeks back.

165
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,640
For various reasons that I can't get into,
I got to get it back somehow.

166
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,016
Camera?

167
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,353
Yeah. This fella Marlo probably took it.
I don't know if he hocked it...

168
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,190
You bothering me about a camera?
You supposed to have my back, remember?

169
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,735
- Five minutes, you told me.
- I know. I owe on the deal.

170
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,824
It's Tyrone's, chicken wings.

171
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,751
Here's the thing. I want you to put it out there

172
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,046
that there's a $500 bounty on this camera
if it comes back.

173
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,425
- No questions asked.
- 500?

174
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,762
Swear to God. I'm good for it.
If it's the right camera.

175
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,598
Here's the model and serial number.

176
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,351
500 for the camera
and chicken for Bubs, huh?

177
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:54,022
Another 100 to you if this happens.
But I need this camera quick or shit will fly.

178
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,484
Look, man, it's not about
the money for me right now.

179
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,654
This motherfucker,
he messing with my livelihood here.

180
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,282
They're always coming back, always.

181
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,618
- He's like some Terminator and shit.
- I'm with you.

182
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:12,374
I'll do all I can to help you with your problem,
and you're gonna help me out with mine.

183
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,136
Who the fuck is Randy?

184
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,638
A little hopper from around the way.

185
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,141
He ain't in the game but he with Michael.

186
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,809
He talking to police?

187
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,980
I know it. He was the one I told,
"Go tell Lex to go up to the alley.

188
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,316
- "Patrice is waiting."
- You were supposed to do that.

189
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,775
I know, but this way,

190
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,279
try to keep some distance
between me and Lex, right?

191
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,077
You tell this Randy what happened to Lex?

192
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,538
No, I swear it.

193
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,589
Go, motherfucker.
The fuck you still waiting for?

194
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,389
- What the fuck y'all following me for?
- Easy, son.

195
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,100
Naw, ain't nobody walking with me nowhere.

196
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,626
- What's up with this Randy?
- He can't hurt us.

197
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,712
- He a snitch, though.
- Put that around, then.

198
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,131
- Slim.
- Marlo.

199
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,677
- How you feeling?
- Can't complain, yo.

200
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:52,391
Getting to be that time, though.
Joe wanted me to check in, you know.

201
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,810
All right. Pull up a chair. Let's chop it up.

202
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:01,108
- Now, that there a Barksdale boy.
- So?

203
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,152
Don't add up.

204
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,156
Interesting, though.

205
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,096
Got a burner, see?
If anything else comes up, you call me.

206
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,808
If this guy robs you again,
make sure he's holding. The more the better.

207
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,019
Shit, I ain't got money for all that.

208
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,114
There's 40 minutes on that,
and my number's in there.

209
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,117
I'm gonna call you today or tomorrow
at the latest.

210
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,915
One and one.

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,084
Damn, son. He did a number on you.

212
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,463
- Who was it?
- Officer Walker.

213
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,298
Walker be evil.

214
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,093
- What up?
- Four.

215
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,808
- We ought to fuck him up.
- Walker? Yo, he the police.

216
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,477
I'm just saying.

217
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,897
He said next time I steal a car,
I'm finding myself dead.

218
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,775
- You gonna do as he say?
- Fuck, no.

219
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:29,488
Soon as I get this shit off,
I'll be running his ass all over town.

220
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,156
Yo, shit!

221
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,328
Told you, Namond.

222
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,038
Gave you fair warning, didn't I?

223
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,416
- I ain't done nothing.
- Get the cash. Got you cold.

224
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,627
Hair like that, I saw you from East Baltimore.

225
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,213
- Get the fuck off of me, man.
- Shut up!

226
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,178
- Look what I found.
- That ain't fucking mine!

227
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,555
Hands on the car! Spread legs.

228
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,226
- I ain't fucking got...
- Shut up!

229
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,189
How you like it so far? Having fun?

230
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,150
Guess what? Gets better.

231
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,236
Give me your hands.

232
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,242
Watch your head.

233
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,208
Damn. Y'all not wasting any time, huh?

234
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,212
Nerese let us stage in the council suite
till the inauguration.

235
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,090
No doubt, after your showing in the general.

236
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,259
- No doubt.
- 81 %?

237
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,680
82. In a city where Democrats
outnumber Republicans nine to one...

238
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,100
Anything less would have
been an embarrassment.

239
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,352
So...

240
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,646
what can we do for you, Senator?

241
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,026
Well, uh, first of all, I wanted to clear the air.

242
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,905
No hard feelings
over what happened during the primary...

243
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,325
You gonna give the money back?

244
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,457
- Senator, it's been a very long day.
- I'll cut to the chase.

245
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,960
I understand you have a problem

246
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,337
at the top of the police department.

247
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,674
You asked Burrell to resign. He declined.

248
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,636
- I'm looking for a replacement.
- The ministers like Burrell.

249
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,430
So does the council president.

250
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,392
We're confident that when
we identify a suitable candidate,

251
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:27,189
Ms. Campbell and the ministers
will see the wisdom of new leadership.

252
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,026
Except y'all need to get
a pay raise through the city council.

253
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,278
Pay raise would help.

254
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,157
I can ask Nerese about
that pay raise getting passed,

255
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:42,245
maybe convince some ministers
they need to move on from Burrell.

256
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:50,337
The situation would have to be resolved
sooner rather than later.

257
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,255
Do my best, partner.

258
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,801
And what do we do for you in return?

259
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,721
I'm in Annapolis.

260
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,558
Word I'm hearing, you may be there too,
in a couple of years.

261
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,895
We may find ourselves
working together closely.

262
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,898
Thanks for your time.

263
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,946
Jesus Christ.

264
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,489
He's slick.

265
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:23,036
Apologizes for the short con and
in the next breath, setting us up for the long.

266
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,623
- He and Burrell are as thick as thieves.
- What is the long con?

267
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,000
At least we know he's running one.

268
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,254
Shiiiii...

269
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,557
- Try calling again.
- Man, I know she not gonna answer.

270
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,101
My moms don't answer when she go to AC.

271
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,521
- When she coming back?
- She going to New York after.

272
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,191
- What's she doing in New York?
- Shopping.

273
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,403
Going to see some show, The Color Purple.

274
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,366
See, now this is where my job gets good.

275
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,371
You reach a guardian, the juvenile master's
gonna recog you on a first-time drug offense.

276
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,624
But now you'd better have
a toothbrush on you, son,

277
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,544
because it's gonna be baby booking tonight.

278
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,303
Namond, you scared?

279
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:28,059
If it was Cheltenham, I don't blame you,
but baby booking's just across town.

280
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,646
The East Side be beefing
with the West Side in there.

281
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,649
There's dudes be getting raped and shit.

282
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,777
I mean, that's what I be hearing.

283
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,033
It's bad in there. I don't know if it's...that bad.

284
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,118
Well, I hear different.

285
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,836
You got no other family?

286
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,172
I got a aunt down in PG County.

287
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,506
You got a number?

288
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,888
- Well, I ain't driving you this late...
- Come on, man.

289
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,151
Tell you what.
Two of my guys are working a double,

290
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,195
working midnight shift tonight.

291
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,282
If you can plant yourself on that bench
there, you can stay here for the night.

292
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,161
But first thing tomorrow,
you raise that aunt or raise your moms,

293
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,205
or I got to process you.

294
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,255
You don't move off that bench.
You need the bathroom, you go now.

295
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,093
Otherwise...sit tight
and don't give anybody any trouble,

296
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,430
- or they'll process you right then and there.
- I'm cool. Thanks.

297
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:55,438
Fucking charity ward here.
I'll go tell the shift commander.

298
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
Yo, Lieutenant...

299
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,370
- He a 50?
- No.

300
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,580
Probably copping it for my moms.

301
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,458
That's why?

302
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:19,587
Look. I told y'all, I just want him gone.

303
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,881
I just want him away from me and Bug.

304
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,217
What the fuck did he do to you?

305
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,309
All right.

306
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,395
We'll take care of it, boss.

307
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,243
- Another church burglary last night.
- Madison Park Methodist.

308
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,537
This would be what you'd call a rash.

309
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,291
We could use some ointment.
We need to arrest these fucks.

310
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,418
- We getting anywhere on that?
- Not yet.

311
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,881
- Who caught the last one? McNulty?
- Working it. We should talk.

312
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,718
- All right.
- Word from on high is to sweep corners.

313
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,597
- They want arrests to double.
- How the fuck how?

314
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,350
- The election's over.
- Quality-of-life violations.

315
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,563
- What are we talking about, loitering?
- Disorderly, public indecency.

316
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,232
- This is horseshit.
- Broken-windows theory.

317
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,318
- Worked in New York.
- This ain't New York.

318
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,278
- But it could work here.
- Never has.

319
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,572
- Never been done right.
- Open containers, too.

320
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,450
- No writing tickets?
- We'll do more of that too.

321
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,661
But the commissioner himself
wants to juke arrests.

322
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,040
- Open container used to be sacrosanct.
- In a paper bag.

323
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,503
They gave you that much respect.
A man's beverage was his business.

324
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,672
- You took them to a restaurant?
- Yeah. Ruth Chris.

325
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,927
- Linen napkins.
- Yeah. Silverware, more than one fork.

326
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,390
- How'd they do?
- Pretty well, considering.

327
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,602
- Did they embarrass us?
- Us?

328
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,980
No, we're fine with it, but...

329
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,400
I mean, they were intimidated,
embarrassed and awkward as hell,

330
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,444
but they made it through.

331
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,532
These aren't the kids that can sit still
for the statewide tests,

332
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,991
much less do well on them.

333
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,453
These were the kids that made it
impossible for anyone to do well.

334
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,664
So, we're writing them off?

335
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,958
No, that's what we're not doing.

336
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:25,338
- You're not educating, you're socializing.
- They weren't being educated before.

337
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,634
- Excuse me?
- Hold on. What he's saying is this.

338
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,554
You put a textbook in front of these kids,

339
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:37,475
or teach them every problem on some
statewide test, it won't matter, none of it,

340
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,645
because they're not learning for our world
they're learning for theirs.

341
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,649
They know what they're training for
and what everyone expects them to be.

342
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,026
I expect them to be students.

343
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,030
But it's not about you or us,
or the tests or the system.

344
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,783
It's what they expect of themselves.

345
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,911
Every single one of them
is headed back to the corners.

346
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,706
Their brothers and sisters, shit, their parents,

347
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,125
they came through these same classrooms.

348
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,669
We pretended to teach,
they pretended to learn.

349
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,423
Where'd they end up?
The same damn corners.

350
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,843
I mean, they're not fools, these kids.

351
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,346
They don't know our world,
but they know their own.

352
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,767
I mean, Jesus, they...
they see right through us.

353
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,564
We made that clear
when you approved the project.

354
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,608
Provisionally approved.

355
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,528
And then, we made it clear
that we would be addressing children

356
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:34,490
that required socialization
before they could be properly educated.

357
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,951
We can't lie.

358
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,412
Not to them.

359
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,208
Captain, line three.

360
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,089
Roll call's over.

361
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,473
You get a line on your mother yet?

362
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,559
Fucking neglect case here, I want it.

363
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,188
How about that aunt?

364
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,902
Ain't nobody else?
No other responsible adult?

365
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,363
- Like who?
- I don't know.

366
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,114
I'm giving you one last shot,

367
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,451
cos once I go on the street
you're gonna have to go to booking.

368
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,081
I got a teacher.

369
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,584
Mr. Colvin. You know him?
He used to be police.

370
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,378
Tall? Bald?

371
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,754
Yeah.

372
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,216
Yeah, I know him.

373
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,428
What if you get the one snitch?
The one with the cart. What's his name?

374
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,805
Bubbles.

375
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,265
Bubbles. Yeah.

376
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,767
You get Bubbles to say he's Fuzzy Dunlop.

377
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,144
Bubbles has been a registered CI for years.

378
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,439
Kima gave him a number
back when she was in plain clothes.

379
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,402
Herc, you worked with him
under that number on the Barksdale stuff.

380
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:56,322
- So how would you fuck up the ID?
- Fuck me, man.

381
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,575
Look. The only way to get out from under this

382
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,370
is to stop fucking lying, OK?

383
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:08,167
Grab your dick, walk into Marimow's office,
and say, "Lieutenant, I made a mistake.

384
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:12,797
"I attributed my PC to an informant
when in fact I had it off a camera."

385
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,676
That I got from ISD without going
through the proper channels. No.

386
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,636
He's gonna take my stripes.

387
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,681
Maybe he does.
But if you wait until ISD asks for that camera

388
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:26,227
and he figures out the lie,
he takes your fucking balls.

389
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,116
Come on! Let's go!

390
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,909
Just around the corner.

391
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,961
Got you now, motherfucker.

392
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,179
In going over my paperwork,
it occurs to me I may have been neglectful.

393
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,681
Look at all this crap!

394
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:09,520
Every day, more and more of
Lester Freamon's bullshit washes up with us.

395
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:17,153
- What the fuck are you saying?
- My paperwork may have been a little sloppy,

396
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,655
and as a result,
I confused myself on some things.

397
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,742
No shit, you were sloppy.

398
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,912
I went back a couple weeks
on your run sheets.

399
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,374
Nothing there references
a meet with a CI 238.

400
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,877
- You went through my run sheets?
- The best I could.

401
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,299
- Sir, listen...
- I don't care. Turn that fucking thing off.

402
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:48,017
I am starting to believe
that this Fuzzy fella doesn't exist.

403
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:55,691
I am starting to believe that you
just followed Stanfield into the train station

404
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,278
and grabbed the first broad
he brushed up against.

405
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,031
- That what happened?
- No. No, sir.

406
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,743
You lie to me now, Sergeant, and I
guaran-fucking-tee you I will jam you up,

407
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,956
ship this whole mess to IID
and pass out sandwiches at your execution.

408
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,499
Yes, sir.

409
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:17,004
You haven't had a case yet worth talking
about, not on Marlo Stanfield, not on anyone.

410
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,468
You bring me something
other than IID complaints,

411
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,972
and I might have reason
to let a few things slide.

412
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,435
Mad at me?

413
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,021
- Come on, now.
- Dukie's just mad at everybody.

414
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,400
Snitch bitch.

415
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,820
Yo, what the fuck was that?

416
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,905
I don't know.

417
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,674
I can't believe y'all doing this shit.

418
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,635
You're degrading the quality of life
in this neighborhood.

419
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,804
- Malt liquor.
- Come on, man!

420
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,892
Brother, shake hands with a pilsner,
maybe a nice pale ale.

421
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,978
Hell, what...? Man! My brew! My shoes!

422
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,981
- God! Man.
- What's the violation?

423
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,859
Parking in a bus stop, expired registration.

424
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:24,030
- First-class police work.
- This is the word from up on high,

425
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,907
straight from the eighth floor downtown.

426
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,659
Blessed bosses juking stats
for the new administration.

427
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,413
I know you think it's bullshit
but I spend my shift where they tell me.

428
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,665
Baker, let me tell you a little secret.

429
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,834
A patrolling officer on his beat

430
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,670
is the one true dictatorship in America.

431
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,924
We can lock a guy up on a humble,
lock him up for real,

432
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:47,386
or we can say, fuck it, pull under the
expressway and drink ourselves to death,

433
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,472
and our partners will cover it.

434
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:54,018
So no one, and I mean no one,
tells us how to waste our shift.

435
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,814
Pulled the reports on those church burglaries.

436
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,150
- Yeah?
- Yeah. There's a pattern.

437
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,570
Times and locations.

438
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:08,491
They're working west by northwest
through Sandtown-Winchester.

439
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,576
The last three, here, here, and here,

440
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,621
these ones in blue
are the churches they haven't hit.

441
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,959
- This is from the incident reports?
- That's why we do the paperwork.

442
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,795
Giving me a fucking ticket, man?

443
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,089
Are you out of your motherfucking mind?

444
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,384
- I live here, man!
- This could get out of hand.

445
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:31,556
- That's what we want, isn't it? More arrests?
- Why you messin' with me, man?

446
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,522
No justice, no peace.

447
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,994
It'll only be for tonight.
Mama gets back from New York tomorrow.

448
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,622
Your call.

449
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,920
The young man seems
to think highly of you, boss.

450
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,548
He invoked your name
with a measure of respect.

451
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,720
It wasn't but a few weeks ago I was with him
being called everything but a child of God.

452
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,930
"Mr. Colvin, sir.

453
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,724
"Fuck you."

454
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,184
Well, at least I said, "Mr".

455
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,277
- So what was the charge?
- Slinging.

456
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,321
He'd been out there a few weeks or so.

457
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,741
First pop, second warning from me.

458
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,744
Maybe you should put him
on the juvenile bus.

459
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:39,540
He want so bad to be a gangster,
maybe it's time he get a taste of a real lockup?

460
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,959
Come on, Mr. C, don't do me like that.

461
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:47,465
I made him sleep on the DEU bench last night,
if that counts for anything.

462
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,052
Isn't there anybody else?
Friend, relative, anybody?

463
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,597
You've always been good
with the knuckleheads, boss.

464
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,564
All right. Let me go call my wife.

465
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,878
Yeah. Go up in that building.

466
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,058
- Mm, man, that was delicious.
- There's more.

467
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,686
No, ma'am. Saving room for the cobbler.

468
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,188
- A la mode?
- Uh huh?

469
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,358
Would you like ice cream on it?

470
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,236
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Nice manners.

471
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,280
From what you told me on the phone, Bunny,

472
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,283
I was expecting more of an adventure.

473
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,292
Bunny?

474
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,378
Only my friends call me Bunny.

475
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,297
- Yeah, but why?
- You don't need to know.

476
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:16,011
And if you tell anybody, I'll cut your balls off.

477
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,644
I'll cut them off, give 'em to Donnelly in a jar.
Don't doubt me, boy.

478
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,069
You ain't got no kids?

479
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:35,072
Grown. They at college and past that.

480
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,748
You told me these kids were rough.

481
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,085
Thank you, sweetie. But don't be fooled.

482
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,504
This is his Eddie Haskell act.

483
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,674
Eddie Haskell? Who that?

484
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,970
You are, son. Trust me.

485
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,099
Take a seat.

486
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,520
Against the wall with the others.
Welcome wagon's coming.

487
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,981
- We need the key to the interview room.
- Why?

488
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,026
- Felony burglary.
- Felony?

489
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,447
Caught them coming out of
St. Martin's on Fulton.

490
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,700
Charging them with the one,
but we might work back on a few more.

491
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:24,038
No shit? Knew there was
still some real criminals left in Baltimore.

492
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,502
Swear to God, I'm seeing citations
for jaywalking.

493
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:34,465
We're locking people up for open container,
for disorderly, for loitering.

494
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,135
Neighborhood people appreciate
quality-of-life arrests.

495
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,723
We're locking up neighborhood people.
My guys, all they see are stats.

496
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,393
The election's fucking over, right?
Who are we doing this for?

497
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,148
- Is this from Burrell or Rawls?
- From the chief of patrol.

498
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,109
- It's rolling downhill, for sure.
- Morale?

499
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,822
Split down the middle.
The officers that love the stats are jazzed.

500
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,158
- The rest of you?
- We don't know where to turn.

501
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:05,830
I thought a new mayor might change this shit,
not ramp it up.

502
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,291
You still fucking that bitch?

503
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,585
Yeah. It burning like hell, man.

504
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,588
When you gonna burn the bitch back?
Check it.

505
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,465
Slim!

506
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,634
- B, what up?
- All right.

507
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,636
- Poot.
- It's good.

508
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,222
- Heard you out.
- Yeah.

509
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,641
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, dawg.

510
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,852
And you with Prop Joe now.

511
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,690
- Never would have thought.
- Yeah, well, life's strange.

512
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,360
Yeah. Holler.

513
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,114
Bodie...how you and Marlo?

514
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,534
You OK with him?

515
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,370
As far as I know, yeah. Why?

516
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,791
- What he did to your boy.
- What boy are you talking?

517
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,503
Big boy, the one rub his hands together
all the time?

518
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,506
Kevin? What about him?

519
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,468
You ain't heard?
Chris and Snoop walked him down an alley.

520
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,346
He in a vacant now.

521
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,891
How you know that?

522
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,476
I seen them lay hands on the boy.

523
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,645
And now the word out on the street.

524
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,901
Sorry, dawg.

525
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,282
Let's roll.

526
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,335
Plymouth Rock.
Got that Plymouth Rock.

527
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,051
All right.

528
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,346
But now look at the next
example question on page 20.

529
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,685
As you can see... If you turn to page 20,
they will sometimes ask you

530
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,439
for words that are
the opposite of words that are underlined.

531
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,151
- Thank you, Mr. Pryzbylewski.
- Thank you.

532
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,742
All right, put away your test notebooks.
Work on those tomorrow.

533
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,581
We have 45 minutes.
We can do Last Of The Mohicans...

534
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,124
No!

535
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,960
Or practise probabilities.

536
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,127
Yeah.

537
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,464
- I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo.
- All right.

538
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,133
I want to see everybody's worksheets out.

539
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,135
Kareem, you want to play dice with me?

540
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,805
Not with you.

541
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,641
And we're not just playing games here,

542
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,144
- we're doing math.
- I'll roll with you, man. Come on.

543
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,897
No kidding. We are.

544
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,343
That's my boy resting his head, see?

545
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,349
Mm.

546
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,352
Hey, Renaldo, you want one?

547
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,856
- No.
- They're from Faidley's, yo.

548
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,358
He might stay home all day, you know?

549
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,318
We gonna find out, ain't we?

550
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,287
- It's about my DSS code.
- You have an appointment?

551
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,498
- Why I need an appointment?
- She doesn't need an appointment.

552
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,418
- Just making it realistic.
- So I get to see somebody?

553
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,254
- Take a number and wait.
- I need to see somebody now.

554
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,674
Don't get angry. Anger doesn't help.
It makes people defensive.

555
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,509
Tell her what you need calmly.

556
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,262
- Card didn't come this month.
- We mailed it.

557
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,057
- Maybe it got stolen.
- Sorry. Nothing we can do.

558
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,516
- Fuck you.
- Chandra!

559
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,769
- She ain't helping me.
- That's how they do.

560
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,688
- Just tell her what you need.
- Need another card, bitch.

561
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,316
- Chandra!
- And that's real too.

562
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,360
Fuck you for real.

563
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,821
Ooh!

564
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,408
Calm down, calm down. Go with Ms. Mason.

565
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,328
- Get your hands off!
- Ms. Mason!

566
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,998
- I'll get the school police.
- You all right?

567
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,541
She was like...

568
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,336
- And then...she was like...
- Typical day?

569
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,505
I wouldn't know. My first time.

570
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,008
Your first time?

571
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,344
Mrs. Donnelly oversees this project.

572
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,639
OK.

573
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,445
Good morning, ladies.

574
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,448
Help a man get something to eat?

575
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,327
God bless.

576
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,501
Good morning, Reverend.

577
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,971
Yo.

578
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,723
- Glad you finally answered.
- I was in a meeting.

579
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,392
You got the asshole pinned down?

580
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,936
Nah, I got Marlo's people,
getting ready to make a drop.

581
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,813
- Where?
- Emerson, near Pulaski.

582
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,316
- You eyeballing them now?
- Yeah, he got the package.

583
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,985
Black bag, putting it in the trunk.

584
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,320
- He getting in now.
- What make?

585
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,365
Late model Lincoln. You want the license?

586
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,412
- Yeah, give it.
- P-R-8-Z-G-O-D.

587
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,957
Yeah, he pulling out now,
turning down Gilmore.

588
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,919
Dozerman, get me Foxtrot.
Good job, Bubs. We're on it.

589
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,799
Ladies, a cellphone?
It's got, like, a half hour on it.

590
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,759
No, thank you.

591
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,736
What I saw today wasn't education
as I understand the term,

592
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,531
and they didn't seem very socialized, either.

593
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,910
- You didn't catch us on our best day.
- Or your worst day?

594
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,495
On the whole, they've made a lot of progress.

595
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,916
Look, they come to class.
They're more engaged. We're reaching them.

596
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,462
- Fewer outbursts, no suspensions.
- But are they learning anything?

597
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,715
- Yes. We believe they are.
- Be truthful.

598
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,845
If this program were to continue
through the rest of the school year,

599
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:42,601
how many of your students could realistically
be expected to return to a regular classroom?

600
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,979
What do you think, Ms. Duquette?

601
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,024
Namond, Darnell, maybe Zenobia.

602
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:55,155
Considering where we started, and that
those kids ain't tearing up other classes...

603
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,908
OK. Mrs. Donnelly.

604
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,993
A tremendous achievement.

605
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,663
Mr. Withers?

606
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,875
I'll go along with Mrs. Donnelly.

607
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,671
You haven't said anything yet.

608
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,965
I just don't see it.

609
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:18,845
Many of these kids are profoundly damaged.
What they've seen, how they've lived.

610
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,891
And I think any gain or progress is temporary.

611
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,811
I think this project may be flawed.

612
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,607
Foxtrot 23-30.
We have a visual on the suspect.

613
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,110
Vehicle headed east on Mulberry.
Do you copy?

614
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,989
- 10-4. We're almost there.
- 10-4.

615
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,954
After your phone call, I checked.

616
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:48,834
It came directly from Burrell.
He bypassed Rawls after I told him...

617
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,713
Burrell's making a play for you to keep him.

618
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,799
By... Just... What did you call that?

619
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,760
- Juking the stats.
- Guy is unbelievable.

620
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,847
It runs completely counter
to all my discussions with Rawls,

621
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,473
with you, with everyone.

622
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,519
He's also serving notice.
He's reasserting control of the department.

623
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,647
He probably figures if you can't fire him,
then you can't fire him.

624
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,026
- Does Rawls know?
- My guess is Rawls heard days ago

625
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,653
from half a dozen district commanders.

626
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,865
- Why not come to me?
- Talk to him.

627
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,911
Why did you come to me?
Why not go to Rawls?

628
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,208
Because I need to know if you're serious.

629
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,961
If Rawls came to you
and this shit is still going on,

630
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:36,048
then you're OK with it,
which is for me a problem.

631
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,760
If he didn't come to you, then either
he's OK with it, which is also a problem,

632
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,012
or he's letting it go
trying to give Burrell enough rope

633
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,640
for you to get angry
and fire him for insubordination.

634
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,559
But I need to know where you stand.

635
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,478
I gave you my word.

636
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,397
Yes. You did.

637
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,986
Well, thanks for going outside
the chain of command.

638
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,824
Don't expect me to make a habit of it.

639
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,258
Stay in the car. Stay in the car.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

640
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,138
- Let's see those hands.
- What's the problem, Officer?

641
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,558
Step slowly out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up.

642
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,197
Unh! Son, be gentler than that.

643
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,157
Shut the fuck up. I ain't your son.

644
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,870
This guy...

645
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,888
What's this, huh? What's this?

646
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:25,198
Know what? I'm gonna damn sure
get your name and badge number.

647
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,459
Daniels. I don't think I know him.

648
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,502
He hasn't played much politics,

649
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,797
though he used to be married to
the new councilwoman in the 11th.

650
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,758
- Marla Daniels?
- Mm. That's the one.

651
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,929
This is the last man we want
as police commissioner, Nerese.

652
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,266
I mean, I squared off against this fella
a few years back,

653
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,101
and he wouldn't listen to me.

654
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:57,105
He won't listen to you, the ministers
or anyone in the community.

655
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,773
- Just Carcetti?
- Mm-hm.

656
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,234
He's the mayor's boy, definitely.

657
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,238
- Carcetti wants how much of a salary bump?
- 50,000, at least,

658
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:09,201
- to be competitive nationally.
- Give him 25.

659
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,329
Enough to make him think
he can win you over eventually

660
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,123
but less than he needs to entice anyone real.

661
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,960
Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna have
to give Daniels six months in CID

662
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,380
before he can bump him again,
for appearances' sake.

663
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,840
So we're buying time here.

664
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,843
Enough for Ervin to show
the mayor who butters the bread.

665
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:31,348
And for events to take
the new-penny shine off Cedric Daniels.

666
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:35,310
I happen to know he's less
the saint than he pretends to be.

667
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,989
This is, uh, Senator Davis.
Is the Mayor in at the moment?

668
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,537
Well...you just tell him his friend Clay

669
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:58,833
got the council president to un-ass
a salary bump for the police commissioner.

670
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,253
You tell him...

671
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,004
write this down, now.

672
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:08,802
You tell him that Senator Davis
has his interests at heart.

673
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,932
Right. Thanks.

674
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,866
Hey, Ma. How was New York?

675
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,246
Hey, Ms. Brice. How are you?

676
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,914
Who asking?

677
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:41,418
This is my teacher, Mom, Mr. Colvin.

678
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,920
Why he here? You in trouble?

679
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:48,258
He stayed at our house last night,
you being in New York and all.

680
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,595
Tell her.

681
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,516
The cops picked me up, saying I was slinging.

682
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,269
They was gonna send me to baby booking.

683
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,855
But we took him in.

684
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:08,236
You leave my son the fuck alone.

685
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,948
And you, you afraid to go to baby booking?

686
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,785
The fuck is wrong with you, boy?
Get in the damn house!

687
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,969
Kid got the point.

688
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:36,973
All these drunk and disorderlies,
graffiti artists, and public urinators,

689
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,976
and we come in with
a pair of felony burglaries.

690
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,020
Nice of you to give him the collar.

691
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,022
He might turn out a decent police.

692
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,776
Gotta come from somewhere.
Young generation.

693
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,904
What about you guys?
Gonna follow in your dad's footsteps?

694
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,989
Hello, I don't think so.

695
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,325
- Not.
- What, then?

696
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,036
- Video game designer.
- Rock star.

697
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,664
- Ahh.
- They want to make money.

698
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,875
- You schooled them well.
- How about you, Little Bunk?

699
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,669
You gonna be a detective, like your daddy?

700
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,545
- Chief of police.
- Nah.

701
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,923
Why not? How about you?

702
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:15,637
He's still in that, you know,
pediatric neurosurgeon stage.

703
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,517
- Hi.
- Hey.

704
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,645
- Elena, how are you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

705
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,607
- Can't complain.
- Hey, boys. How are you?

706
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,360
Can you say "hi"?

707
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,655
Listen. They're fine.
They really do have manners.

708
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,742
- It's all right. My kids are the same way.
- We're just finishing up. Sit down.

709
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,955
Uh...OK. Just for a minute.

710
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,790
Dad, five bucks for the jukebox?

711
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,960
What? What happened
to three plays for a quarter?

712
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:52,757
- Um...homework?
- Done, Dad helped us.

713
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,467
Oh.

714
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,678
I got off early. Here.

715
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:00,181
You want to go, too?

716
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,185
- So what are you drinking?
- I'll have a white wine.

717
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,772
I'm good, thanks.

718
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,620
So it's true? You quit drinking?

719
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,415
Well, I have a beer now and again.

720
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,459
No big deal.

721
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,341
How's Dennis?

722
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,429
Dennis is... Dennis.

723
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,723
We're close, we're not.

724
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,017
You know, we'll see.

725
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,771
- How's Beadie?
- We're good.

726
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,566
- The kids have my number, but...
- Hm.

727
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,530
Wow.

728
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,117
If I had known you were gonna
grow up to be a grown-up...

729
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,956
Pssh, man.

730
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:11,252
And I'm the one told him to do the right thing
and go talk to the man.

731
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,172
Don't seem that way now, do it?

732
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,509
Yo, you got to look at
it from Marlo's point of view.

733
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,262
- How is it different from Wallace?
- Stringer said Wallace snitched.

734
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,808
- Yo, Kevin might have snitched too.
- Man, but he didn't.

735
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:29,479
- And we had to do Wallace!
- Yo, Marlo thought he had to do Kevin.

736
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,190
- Man.
- But he didn't.

737
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,275
That's what I'm saying.

738
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:40,198
- It's cold, motherfucker.
- It's a cold world, Bodie.

739
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,200
Thought you said it was getting warmer.

740
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,996
World going one way, people another, yo.

741
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,793
Now, Elton Brand, what you know about him?

742
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,170
Nothing. You see?

743
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,673
Bug, you seen your daddy?

744
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,008
Went to the store.

745
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,598
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go look for him.

746
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,976
- You ain't gonna find him.
- Why not?

747
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,564
Because he ain't coming back.

748
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,460
Thanks.

749
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,922
- What's this about?
- Like you don't know.

750
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:23,009
Man, I ain't been home long enough
to get in somebody's shit.

751
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,596
You like boys, motherfucker?

752
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,307
- What?
- Boys. You like fucking them?

753
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,436
Man, I like pussy. All right? Booty.

754
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,355
Living with a woman now.

755
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,982
She got kids?

756
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,860
I ain't touch them kids! Who told you that?

757
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:47,408
I know what you're saying,
but when you're in the inside, ain't no pussy.

758
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,288
Well, yeah, shit. You've been inside.

759
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,582
Man got to bust his nut,
you know what I'm sayin'?

760
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,000
I do.

761
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:54,684
Damn. You didn't even wait
to get the motherfucker in the house.
