1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,200
I don't know, man. I mean, I'm kind of sad.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
Them Towers be home to me.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,900
You gonna cry over a housing project now?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Man, they should have blew
the motherfuckers up a long time ago...

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,300
- you ask me.
- Man, it ain't all been bad.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,000
I mean, I done seen some shit happen
up in them Towers...

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,800
that still make me smile, yo.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>A few moments from now,</i>
<i>the Franklin Terrace Towers behind me...</i>

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>which, sadly, came to represent some</i>
<i>of this city's most entrenched problems...</i>

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>will be gone.</i>

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,500
Y'all talking about steel and concrete, man.
Steel and fucking concrete.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,400
Man, I'm talking about people,
memories and shit.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,100
That ain't the same.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Look, they gonna tear this building down.
They gonna build some new shit.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
But people?
They don't give a fuck about people.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
<i>You are very soon going to see...</i>

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>low and moderately priced houses...</i>

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>- built in their place.</i>
- Yeah!

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,500
My cousin used to live in 221.
I used to be up in there all the time.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Man, who you be telling?
I caught my first pussy up in there.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,200
The girl, Chantay.

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,700
Man, why didn't you say something before?

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,900
They probably wouldn't be
tearing this tower down now.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
They could put a big-ass sign in the front...

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,900
that says, "Here's where Malik Carr
first got his dick wet."

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,300
You know what I'm saying, too?

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,100
We could be taking pictures.
Tourists be taking pictures and shit.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,500
- Souvenirs of your dick about this size.
- He ain't funny, yo. He just jealous.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,300
What? Jealous of that?
You crazy? Chantay?

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,500
Man, the mention of that bitch
make my dick burn.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,100
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah, that's what they keep telling your ass
down at the clinic, man.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,800
Keep that shit up.
You ever see this motherfucker...

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,300
when he walking down to the clinic burnt?

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,900
Poot be like this. He looks like
a backwards-ass cowboy and shit.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Instead of like this,
homie, here, walking like this.

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
Dick looking like a fried chicken wing.

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,900
<i>Now, mistakes have been made.</i>

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,100
<i>And we will learn from those mistakes.</i>

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,700
<i>Reform is not just a watchword</i>
<i>with my administration.</i>

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,500
<i>- No, it's a philosophy.</i>
- Yeah!

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,200
Shit, man, no matter how many times
you get burnt, man...

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,100
you just keep on doing the same.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Nigga do not learn.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,900
<i>Now, what do you say, huh?</i>

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
<i>Are you ready for a new Baltimore?</i>

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,000
Shit gonna be off the hook, yo.

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
Man, my whole life
been around them Towers, you know?

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
I mean, I <i>feel...</i>

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,500
Shit, I feel like
I don't got no home no more.

51
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Housing just moved your mama
up to Poplar Grove, didn't it?

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
You ain't homeless, nigga, you got a home.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,600
Shit, you just damn near out of work is all.

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,400
- What you mean?
- I mean, look. All over the city...

55
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,900
even out in the county, you had people,
coke or dope, 24l7.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Where was it they go?

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,200
Man, look, you live in the projects.

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,800
You ain't shit. But you sling product here?

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,300
You got the game by the ass, man.

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,200
Shit, now these
downtown suit-wearing-ass bitches...

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,000
done snatched up the best territory
in the city from y'all.

62
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,200
You wanna cry over some shit,
cry over that.

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,300
<i>All right, everyone. Count with me.</i>

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,100
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
<i>eight, seven...</i>

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,100
<i>six, five...</i>

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
<i>four, three, two, one!</i>

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, shit.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,700
Fuck! I just stepped in dog shit.

70
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,100
You hope.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,700
Fuck.

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
It's Cheese? Can you see him?

73
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
<i>- Yo, where he at?</i>
<i>- Who you mean?</i>

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,700
<i>Cheese, man. I'm looking for Cheese, man.</i>

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>Nigga, you ain't supposed to be</i>
<i>dropping names and shit.</i>

76
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>Ain't you got no sense?</i>

77
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,600
<i>I ain't said shit about shit, man.</i>

78
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
<i>I'm just looking to get together</i>
<i>with the man, man.</i>

79
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,300
<i>- To see him about nothing at all.</i>
<i>- So he be where he be, fool.</i>

80
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,400
<i>Is he at the place that we was at?</i>

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
<i>'Cause I'm looking to,</i>
<i>you know, saddle up...</i>

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
<i>and then put another bat</i>
<i>on this motherfucker.</i>

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,400
<i>He need to deal with me today or I'm gonna</i>
<i>take it to someone who can handle it, man.</i>

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,200
<i>- It's nothing. We let him know.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

85
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,700
"Saddle up and put another bat
on the motherfucker"?

86
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,700
Settle up and put another bet.

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,100
But what was that last part?

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,800
Man said, "He need to deal with me today...

89
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,200
"or I'm gonna take it to someone
who can handle it."

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Girl, you do have an ear.

91
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
<i>He's looking to get with him.</i>

92
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- Same thing as before?</i>

93
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,600
<i>- Same thing I told him.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
What are you seeing?

95
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,800
Call comes in to Cheese's number two.

96
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
He whispers in the man's ear
and off they go.

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,500
- Yeah. Nothing to the call here.
<i>- I figured that.</i>

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
These guys come correct.

99
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
The phones only go so far.

100
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,500
Above that,
it's all done as a face-to-face meet.

101
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,300
Three months
and we've yet to hear his voice.

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,700
And Herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,700
So, me and Truck go up the wrong way
on Stricker Street?

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
You got a badge, remember?

105
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
And we're doing the same one block over...

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so they can't come to ground
that block neither.

107
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,400
Now, the thing is, when we jump out
on these little cocksuckers...

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,800
there'll be a designated runner.

109
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,000
Who's gonna sky up,
just so we get to chase his ass.

110
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,000
But fuck him. We let him go and jack
every other motherfucker who stays.

111
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Let's mount up.

112
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Carv.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's up?

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,100
He's a complicated man. And the only one
that understands him is his woman.

115
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,900
Seek therapy.

116
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,200
Narcos. Narcos!

117
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Let's see your hands! See your hands!
See your hands, up against the wall!

118
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,600
- Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
- Put your hands up against the wall.

119
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,200
- You ain't gotta push me.
- Hands upstairs.

120
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,600
Keep your hands up.

121
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,300
- Anything on you?
- Here he goes.

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Later, son. Step light.

123
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,600
Yo, was that the stash? Fuck!

124
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,400
Let's go, let's go! Cut him off on Stricker.

125
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,000
<i>I've got Calhoun. Where you at?</i>

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,100
Lost him. Rear of Stricker, 800 block.

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
Clear on Riggs.

128
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,100
He just went across Stricker in an alley
headed for Gilmor.

129
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Fuck.

130
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
We got rabbit in the alleys
near Gilmor and Riggs.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,200
- How about some backup?
<i>- Roger that.</i>

132
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,400
<i>Dozerman, what's your 20?</i>
<i>Hey, Doze, where you at, man?</i>

133
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,100
<i>- Did he cross Stricker?</i>
<i>- Definitely.</i>

134
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,900
<i>Everybody...</i>

135
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,500
Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

136
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,900
He went to ground in this block, man.

137
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, listen to me,
you little fucking piece of shit!

138
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,100
I'm gonna tell you one thing,
and one thing only...

139
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,700
about the Western boys
you are playing with!

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
We do not lose!

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,700
And we do not forget!

142
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,900
And we do not give up! Ever!

143
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,600
So I'm only gonna say this one time.

144
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,800
If you march your ass out here right now
and put the bracelets on...

145
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,200
we will not kick the living shit out of you!

146
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you...

147
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,500
or if you make us come back down here
tomorrow night...

148
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,400
catch you on a corner,
I swear to fucking Christ...

149
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,800
we will beat you longer and harder
than you beat your own dick!

150
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,300
'Cause you do not get to win, shitbird.
We do!

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,000
With these Towers down,
we need to take the rest of them low-rises...

152
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,000
and all them Fayette Street corners.

153
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Take them? Take them how, Mr. Bodie?

154
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
- You say "fuck it" and take them.
- Nigga, you ain't got the floor.

155
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,800
Chair don't recognize your ass.

156
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,100
Take them how?

157
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't know.

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Just let them Fayette niggas know,
you know, we serious, right?

159
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You know, get or get got.

160
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
Yeah, like you did on McCulloh Street
last year?

161
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,400
Snatch the real estate, load up...

162
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,000
and just wait
for some shit to happen, right?

163
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,900
No, man,
we done worrying about territory, man...

164
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
what corner we got, what project.

165
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Game ain't about that no more.
It's about product.

166
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah.

167
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,700
We got the best goddamn product...

168
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
so we gonna sell
no matter where we are, right?

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,400
Product, motherfuckers. Product.

170
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Chair recognize Slim Charles.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,700
Chair, our people got to stand somewhere,
don't they?

172
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,300
I mean, all the product in the world
don't mean nothing...

173
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,000
if you constantly getting your ass whupped
for standing on another fool's corner, man.

174
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,300
All right.

175
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,800
We had six of the Towers
on the Terrace, right? All running 24l7.

176
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,200
But three of those
we had to give to Prop Joe's people...

177
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,000
to upgrade the package
that we was putting out there, right?

178
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
Now, how much you think we lost
in the deal?

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,300
All right, the answer is, we made more.

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,900
Half the real estate, twice the product.

181
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
And our profit went up, like,
eight or nine percent. Yo, get it straight.

182
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,400
Your territory ain't gonna mean shit
if your product is weak.

183
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,800
Go ahead and ask them motherfuckers
trying to sell them Ford Tempos...

184
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,400
and you got niggas riding around
in Japanese and German cars...

185
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
in America all day.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,300
Territory ain't shit.

187
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,700
Especially when you consider
it's the fight for the territory...

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,700
that be bringing the bodies
and the bodies that bring the...

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,100
police.

190
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
- Yeah, but how we gonna stand...
- Yo.

191
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,900
Chair ain't recognize your ass, man.

192
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,900
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
How we gonna stand on some corner
that's not ours?

194
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
Well, we got the best product, right?

195
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,100
So the chances are, we gonna be able
to bring in the competition...

196
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,600
by offering to re-up with us
from our package.

197
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Feel me?

198
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Everybody making money,
sharing the real estate.

199
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,600
Slim Charles.

200
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,200
But what if
they don't cop our re-up, though?

201
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,900
Well, I'm gonna worry about that
when it happen.

202
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,200
Until then, Mr. Charles, we gonna
handle this shit like businessmen.

203
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,500
Sell the shit, make the profit,
and later for that gangster bullshit.

204
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,900
Yeah.

205
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,400
Do the chair know we gonna look
like some punk-ass bitches out there?

206
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,300
Motherfucker, I will punk your ass
for saying such shit!

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
- Yo, yo, String.
- What?

208
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
- Poot did have the floor, man.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

209
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
This nigga too ignorant
to have the fucking floor.

210
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Y'all niggers need to start looking
at the world in a new fucking light.

211
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Start thinking about this shit
like some grown fucking men.

212
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,300
Not some niggas off the fucking corner.
You heard me?

213
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,500
Adjourn your asses.

214
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,100
Y'all look like shit.

215
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, we been stuck in that vacant
since before dawn.

216
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,100
- How should we look?
- Proud to know you, Detective.

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,200
- Nice look on you.
- Dress for success.

218
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,300
I watched that motherfucker Cheese
take re-ups...

219
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,000
move weight all day, and not once
did he go near a fucking telephone.

220
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,600
Closest it comes is a call
to a hanger-on's cell phone ten feet away.

221
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Which brings me back to what
I was just discussing with the Lieutenant.

222
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
So far, we've been up on some
of these cell phones for nearly six months.

223
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,600
The only drug talk we have
is from street-level small fry.

224
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,900
So, the feeling
is that maybe two weeks from now...

225
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,100
we don't go back to the court
for another extension.

226
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
We charge what we have...

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
we try to roll someone up at Cheese
or one of Joe's other lieutenants.

228
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
What, are you kidding?
We don't have a case worth making yet.

229
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,900
And at this rate, we never will.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
- For Christ's sake.
- As a plan on paper, it was a good one.

231
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,800
We came out of the port investigation
with good phone numbers...

232
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,800
for some of Prop Joe's people,
and the PC to get up on those phones.

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,500
I guarantee if we can push this thing
a level or two above the street...

234
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
we're gonna start seeing Prop Joe himself.

235
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
We start seeing Joe,
we're gonna see Stringer.

236
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.

237
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,900
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall or we let it go.

238
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,700
- Baker?
- Yes, sir.

239
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
- So you must be Castor.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,600
- Officer Aaron Castor.
- You any kin to Lloyd Castor?

241
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
- Yes, sir, that's my uncle.
- Good police.

242
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you know where you are?

243
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,400
- You, too. Where are you?
- The Western, Major.

244
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,300
Right this very goddamn second,
you getting your hind parts kicked...

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,900
and you on the horn screaming for help.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And you got your backup
looking all over the place...

247
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,200
'cause he don't know
where the fuck you are.

248
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,200
And that means
I gotta explain to your next of kin...

249
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,300
how you went and got yourselves killed
on my watch?

250
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Sir, we're at 1034 North Mount,
first floor rear.

251
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,300
Good.

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Now, which way is north?

253
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,500
Point.

254
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,100
That's east.

255
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Now, don't you think
if you're in a foot pursuit...

256
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,600
it might help your backup to know
what direction you're running?

257
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,500
Even numbers tell you north and west.

258
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Odds, south and east.

259
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,700
Compasses. Until you learn that much,
you carry one.

260
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,100
Welcome to the Western.

261
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Gentlemen, scuff yourself up a little.

262
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,100
And learn the stare.

263
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,100
Hey, Carv, where you at?

264
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm at a desk outside the roll call room
on the first floor of 1034 North Mount.

265
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,100
My feet are facing west
and my dick is pointing south-southwest.

266
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Bunny Colvin's been giving that speech
as long as you guys been sucking air.

267
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Where you at, shitbird?

268
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,900
You're in handcuffs, in my house,
looking stupid, ain't you?

269
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,700
Fleeing and eluding?

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Do we have a drug charge here?

271
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,800
Loitering in a designated drug-free zone.

272
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,300
Let me rephrase. Do we have drugs?

273
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,900
He raised up when we hit his corner
and he grabbed this bag.

274
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,900
We pursued and recovered the bag.

275
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,100
But no drugs.

276
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
- And they whupped my ass.
- Western District way.

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
So, what did we learn?

278
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,700
Using half my district K-9 and the copter
to bring a 14-year-old to bay.

279
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,900
What did we learn?

280
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,500
That you can't raise up and run
from a drug corner in Sector One...

281
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
without my boot finding your ass.

282
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Right?

283
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,700
I got it, I got it, I got it. Got it.

284
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Cast iron. $20 at least.

285
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
It'd be better if it was copper.
Be better if it was copper.

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah, be better if it was gold.

287
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,800
But you know, you gotta take life
as it goes along, you know.

288
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

289
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
- We're past sorry.
- Oh, fuck, man, chill.

291
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Chill, chill!

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,100
- We definitely don't need this, man.
- You think you fucked up now?

293
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,500
- What's up?
- Look what they did to my ride.

294
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, do it or don't.
But I got someplace to be.

295
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you for your kindness.

296
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,800
You all got to pay something, anything.

297
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,300
- There be a principle here.
- Lf we had a dime, you'd have a dime.

298
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,900
We're a little insufficient right now, okay?
We're on our way to the metal man.

299
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We'll come back and pay for everything.
I promise you.

300
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,200
Hey, hey, after the junk man,
we gotta roll past K-Mart.

301
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
Definitely.

302
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,300
<i>One last question, Commissioner.</i>

303
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,500
<i>Looking back over the past couple months,</i>
<i>if I read the felony breakdowns correctly...</i>

304
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
<i>you've been seeing an up-tick in shootings</i>
<i>and serious assaults...</i>

305
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
<i>in the Eastern District especially.</i>

306
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,900
<i>Can we assume</i>
<i>that you're already addressing this?</i>

307
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
<i>Let me throw that over to Bill.</i>

308
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,900
<i>As Deputy for Operations,</i>
<i>I'm sure he's got a handle on our response.</i>

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,300
<i>I do indeed.</i>

310
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,400
<i>In answer to your question, Councilman...</i>

311
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,300
<i>I can assure you</i>
<i>that we've put additional tactical teams...</i>

312
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
<i>on a 7:00-to-3:00 shift</i>
<i>in every Eastern sector.</i>

313
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
<i>Additionally, we've put</i>
<i>the district flex squad...</i>

314
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
<i>on a 7:00-to-3:00 shift...</i>

315
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
<i>being as those are the hours...</i>

316
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,800
<i>when we're seeing a spike</i>
<i>in aggravated assaults.</i>

317
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>Thank you, Deputy.</i>

318
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,400
<i>Anything else</i>
<i>for these esteemed constables?</i>

319
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
<i>No?</i>

320
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,500
<i>Okay, then,</i>
<i>I guess I'll see you all tomorrow night...</i>

321
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,500
<i>for the quarterly budget review.</i>

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,900
Erv, hey...

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
if you don't mind, I'd like to get with you
about a couple things.

324
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,900
Can we get lunch?

325
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.

326
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,600
- How about Werner's in a half-hour?
- Half-hour, good.

327
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,200
Who was that skirt with him?

329
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
That's him there in the orange?

330
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
- That's Drac.
- Our last best hope.

331
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.

332
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,900
- Here, listen.
<i>- No, no, no, the other thing.</i>

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
<i>The good... The other thing, my nigga.</i>

334
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,000
<i>- You talking him?</i>
<i>- No, her. I mean her!</i>

335
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,400
<i>Cocaine, nigga, you feel me now?</i>

336
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
<i>Goddamn, you ignorant...</i>

337
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
When was the last time
you heard that on a wire?

338
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Shame he doesn't report to anyone
that matters.

339
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,300
Right now, Drac's re-ups
are with Lavell Manns.

340
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,800
He's got those corners
over on Preston and Bond.

341
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,800
He was pretty close to selling us weight.

342
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,900
No shit. Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Lavell's a soldier.
He's not gonna roll up on Prop Joe.

344
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's true.

345
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,500
But if we take him off
with a hand-to-hand...

346
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
they gotta promote someone
to replace him.

347
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah, why Drac?

348
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,900
- One thing about our boy?
- That's Prop Joe's nephew.

349
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,300
On his mama's side.

350
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
$20 and $2.

351
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,300
Y'all know you ain't got pants?

352
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,000
And there's Dominic standing in line.

353
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,600
And when he finally gets up
to meet the President...

354
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,400
who's looking the other way,
Dominic reaches around behind Carter...

355
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,800
- grabs his belt, yanks it up...
- Secret Service must've shit.

356
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,400
He says,
"Hey, Mr. President, remember me?"

357
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
And Carter actually remembers.

358
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Says, "Sure, Dominic DiPietro
from Baltimore, on the campaign trail."

359
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,200
And Dominic doesn't miss a beat.

360
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,800
He puts his finger in Jimmy Carter's face...

361
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,400
and says, "So where's that money
you promised me three years ago...

362
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
"to fix up my streets and alleys?"

363
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,600
- Unbelievable.
- That's nothing.

364
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes back here to speak...

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,500
at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner
or something...

366
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,100
and Dominic is ushered up to him.

367
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Carter asks about his health,
and Dominic says...

368
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,700
"You son of a bitch, I'm still waiting
on that money for my streets and alleys."

369
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Come on!

370
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,600
No shit. Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth.

371
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,100
Some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.

372
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Guy says, "Christ, Dominic...

373
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
"you just called
the President of the United States an SOB."

374
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,000
He shrugs, he says,
"Fuck him. I don't need him. He lost."

375
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,800
No, that's good. That is good.

376
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
And that is from whence I come.

377
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Proud son of the fighting First District.

378
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
But the truth is...

379
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,900
I don't wanna be just another muldoon
like Dominic DiPietro...

380
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,500
warming the backbench.

381
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,000
Not with the way things are right now
in the city.

382
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,000
We're losing 10,000,
12,000 residents a year.

383
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,300
And when you ask them
why they're moving to the county...

384
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
you know what they say?

385
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,000
- Schools.
- And crime.

386
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
Schools and crime.

387
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,300
And there goes our tax base
right across the line...

388
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,700
and the Mayor's acting like a 10% bump
in the murder rate is business as usual.

389
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,900
- Check, please.
- And you know what?

390
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,900
If you were smart, you'd come to me
when the Mayor shorts you...

391
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,200
on hiring, on equipment,
on overtime, on cars.

392
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,300
You get the shit end of the stick,
you come to me.

393
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,300
Not publicly.
I know you can't cross the Mayor publicly.

394
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,100
But backdoor, you come to me...

395
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,400
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.

396
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
Thanks.

397
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,000
- Kind offer.
- Erv, I can help you.

398
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
And we can turn this damn city around...

399
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,500
But long ago, when I was just starting out
in the Department...

400
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,500
I had the good fortune to be taught
a little something about chain of command.

401
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,900
And right now,
in my capacity as Acting Commissioner...

402
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
I report to Mayor Royce.

403
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,900
I got your coffee. Leave a tip if you want.

404
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,500
So what do you need to see me for?

405
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,700
- You're getting out tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

406
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Probably trying to reach out.

407
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
- What you gonna do first?
- Huh?

408
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Tomorrow. What you gonna do?

409
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,300
I don't know.

410
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,100
I know what be first. You don't know?
I know what be first.

411
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm going home.

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,100
Time out!

413
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,900
Back in!

414
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,300
Watch the hole. Watch the hole.

415
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,400
Short-timer.

416
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,100
You know you got the one day left, huh?

417
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,400
- You done the one, just gotta do that other.
- All right.

418
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,100
Like they say.

419
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,200
You only do two day.

420
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,700
- There's the day you go <i>in...</i>
- The day you come out.

421
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
I don't know. I did 14 years.

422
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, yeah, you know.
You did you a little stretch, true.

423
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
But you still a soldier, right?

424
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
You know them Towers
done came down now, huh?

425
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
The Terrace? The Murphy Homes?
All that shit gone, man.

426
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
A lot of things is different now
since you been up in here. You'll see.

427
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,400
- Lot of changes.
- Yeah, no doubt.

428
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,700
But, I mean, you know, shit.
Some things, they stay the same, man.

429
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I mean, the game's the game.

430
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,800
And the thing is,
since the Towers is gone...

431
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm gonna need to take my thing up
to some new places. You feel me?

432
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
You know I'm gonna be home
soon enough, right?

433
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,700
Yeah, first parole hearing, I'm out. For real.

434
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,900
Shit is fixed right.

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
I come <i>home...</i>

436
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Shit!

437
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,000
There's gonna be a little hell to be paid.
You know what I mean?

438
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,600
A good soldier ain't gonna lack for work.

439
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Take that number, man.
When you out, you call.

440
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,400
We'll hook you up, man, no problem.

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,900
You know, it's like a coming-home gift.
All right?

442
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,400
Call it.

443
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
The joint might have broke him.

444
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,100
Boss, you talking about a homie
walked up and shot Elijah Davis.

445
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,200
Broad daylight, at Pennsie and Gold.

446
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,400
Then picked up the phone, dialed 911...

447
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
told the police,
"I just shot a nigga, come get him."

448
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,600
That dude ain't breaking.

449
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Look, we had the $20, you know.
But we had to go buy some pants.

450
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,700
So if you just take this short money...

451
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,100
we get back at you tomorrow, man.
We get you on the comeback.

452
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,500
Yo, he want two for $16.

453
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Trying to get two, man.
I'm trying to get two.

454
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,200
From this young motherfucker.

455
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
No.

456
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,300
Come on, man, see,
you see, we a little short now...

457
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,100
but tomorrow,
I'll be right back here with the $4...

458
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,900
Joey said no.

459
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Fucking guy, man.

460
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,000
At these prices,
I can't afford more phone surveillance.

461
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm aware of that.

462
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,300
And right now, the plan is to go
for a hand-to-hand on one lieutenant...

463
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,300
a couple rungs down from Proposition Joe.

464
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
And then roll the lieutenant up?

465
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,000
We don't think he'll have much roll to him.

466
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Joe's people are pretty schooled.

467
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,200
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer, who's a fool...

468
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,000
to replace him. Name of Drac.

469
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,300
And we're on his cell phone.

470
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,700
If he gets promoted,
maybe he talks to Joe or Joe's top people.

471
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
We get that far,
maybe we start to see Stringer Bell.

472
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,500
What makes you think
they'll promote the wrong man?

473
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,700
We do it all the time.

474
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Look, speaking of promotions,
I sent yours over to the Hall, as promised.

475
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,300
- And?
- And the Mayor's holding it up.

476
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,200
My understanding is
he wants to know what your wife is doing.

477
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,100
- My wife?
- Yeah.

478
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,100
There's a rumor that she's gonna
take a run at a Council seat.

479
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Maybe try to knock off Eunetta Perkins.

480
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,000
- That's my wife's business.
- Yes, it is.

481
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,100
But the Mayor counts Eunetta as an ally.

482
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,900
Our deal was for a permanent unit
and the next vacancy for major.

483
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,300
You got your unit.

484
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,600
And I sent your name over to the Hall.
I kept my word.

485
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,700
But the Mayor...

486
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,200
he may wanna know who his friends are
before he makes a new commander.

487
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Where'd she say she was gonna be at?

488
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,100
Near the dugout, first-base side.
She'll turn up.

489
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,400
When is she supposed
to bring them over to you?

490
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,200
Middle of the fourth.

491
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
Dad, can I have a hot dog?

492
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,300
Yeah, as soon as the guy comes around.

493
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaking of which, where's the beer man?

494
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,800
There they are.

495
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
Damn. They got great seats.

496
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,100
Hell.

497
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
- What?
- Who's that on her left? The suit.

498
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
- Just a friend?
- No, he's in the cake.

499
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,900
Who comes to an Orioles game in a suit,
spends half the time on a cell phone?

500
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,300
Downtown lawyer.

501
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,300
Something wealthy like that.

502
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,400
- Wish we had more of it.
- Long way to go for half a shot.

503
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,300
It'll be better tomorrow, Bubs.

504
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
What kind of dope fiend
be talking about tomorrow?

505
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,600
Tomorrow ain't shit.

506
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,500
Today, Johnny. Today.

507
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,500
I hunted down all that metal.
Lugged it around like a dog.

508
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,400
I nearly get killed over a scratch of metal,
so that I gotta beg for my life.

509
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,900
Lost my trousers, man,
my fucking trousers.

510
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,500
And then I'm begging again for half a shot?

511
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
I swear to God, man, I'm not even high.

512
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,600
- We just missed a foul, Pa.
- Yeah?

513
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,200
Our seats are great.
We're practically on the field.

514
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Yeah, my friend, Dennis,
he gets company seats every now and then.

515
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,300
- Where are you sitting?
- Mezzanine. Come on.

516
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,300
No, no, you guys go.
Your dad hasn't seen you all week.

517
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Now, don't take their jackets off,
'cause Sean's just getting over a cold.

518
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Okay?

519
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,700
Jimmy, right? Dennis Kerpelman.

520
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Great kids.

521
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,700
Anyway, nice meeting you.

522
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,100
- Do you want anything from the stand?
- No, thank you.

523
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,000
Don't stay till the last inning,
'cause it's a school night.

524
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,300
Bye.

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,700
You got spatter going in two different
directions, just off the curb.

526
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,300
- Yeah.
<i>- Shooting on the west side.</i>

527
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,500
Another one? Christ, where?

528
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
<i>North and Pulaski, Cole's up.</i>

529
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Cole's working a cutting off Belvedere.

530
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Call Crutchfield.
See if he's back from the Westport scene.

531
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,500
<i>- Crutchfield?</i>
- Lf not, call Bunk at home.

532
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,000
<i>- Bunk's off day.</i>
- Well, fuck his off day.

533
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
I love this town.

534
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Perlozzo's pretty quick to yank a pitcher,
ain't he?

535
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm thinking of becoming a woman.

536
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Red-hot peanuts!

537
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,000
Office. Yeah.

538
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
I'm at the ballgame.

539
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,900
The ballgame.

540
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,700
Yeah, what about Cole? Call him.

541
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,100
Oh, shit.

542
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,000
All right.

543
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight.

544
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,600
They're telling me I gotta come in
on my day off.

545
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
Five?

546
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,700
City's jumping bad, man.

547
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
Okay, listen.

548
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,000
- I gotta go to work, all right?
- All right.

549
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,600
Mr. Jimmy's <i>gonna...</i>

550
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,800
He's gonna take you home.

551
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,100
You're on your own, partner.

552
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,300
Hey, Ma.

553
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,600
<i>- And Erdman Avenue?</i>
<i>- No ballistic information.</i>

554
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,700
<i>Are you sure?</i>

555
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
<i>Take your time, Major.</i>

556
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,200
Can you believe that cocksucker Carcetti?
Thinking I'm gonna talk out of school.

557
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,700
<i>Any day now, Marvin.</i>

558
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,300
What can a white councilman give me
that a black mayor can't?

559
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,100
No, you played it right.

560
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,100
<i>It was a .38</i>
<i>recorded on Erdman Avenue, sir.</i>

561
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
<i>So what you are, in effect, saying, Major,</i>
<i>is rather than looking...</i>

562
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,600
<i>at this cluster of robberies</i>
<i>you had along Monument Street...</i>

563
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,500
<i>you chose to investigate each</i>
<i>using separate personnel.</i>

564
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,400
<i>No, sir, three of those cases</i>
<i>were commercial robberies...</i>

565
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
<i>so we sent those downtown to CID.</i>

566
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,100
<i>- My people had responsibility...</i>
<i>- God damn it, Marvin!</i>

567
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>Did you just</i>
<i>invoke the word "responsibility"...</i>

568
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,700
<i>to explain</i>
<i>why you didn't get on top of this shit?</i>

569
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,100
<i>Did you just do that? I don't think</i>
<i>you know what the word means.</i>

570
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>When I look at the 24's and plainly see...</i>

571
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,800
<i>that some .38-caliber asshole</i>
<i>is raping your entire district...</i>

572
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,900
<i>all the way from Greenmount</i>
<i>to fucking Edison Highway.</i>

573
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,900
<i>It's policing like that</i>
<i>that makes it possible for us to get hit...</i>

574
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,600
<i>with five fucking homicides</i>
<i>in a single fucking night, people!</i>

575
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,300
- Poor fucking Marvin.
- Better him than us, right?

576
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Based on your testimony,
the buy itself will be enough to charge...

577
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,200
but you get him saying something on tape,
it's even better.

578
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,600
Are you sure this guy
wants to be selling you weight?

579
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,400
'Cause we don't wanna be forcing this.

580
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,700
I been stroking this guy
for two months, man.

581
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,300
That's not what he asked you.

582
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,000
This guy is ripe and ready, Kima.
It ain't no thing.

583
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,900
They're about ready.

584
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,500
You living out of the office, Cedric?

585
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,500
All right, Drac is depending on you people.

586
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,500
Mount up.

587
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,500
And find your way home.

588
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,800
Look a little light to be an ounce,
don't you think?

589
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,000
No, man.
Ain't nothing light, it's just settled, is all.

590
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,700
All right, man, if it does what it should...

591
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,800
I'm gonna come back to you for three,
maybe four a week.

592
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,100
- Yeah, that could work.
- We good, then?

593
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
We good.

594
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,600
- That's it.
- Take him down.

595
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
- Somebody snitching!
- Shut the fuck up!

596
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
Let's go, Lavell.

597
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,400
It's Cutty.

598
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,900
Was told I could call for help.

599
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,800
What about the Oxbow?

600
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,100
The Oxbow on Laurens, at Fulton. All right.

601
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Damn.

602
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,500
<i>I'm saying, they caught Lavell</i>
<i>with, like, a whole ounce.</i>

603
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,700
<i>Might not be no bail for that much weight.</i>

604
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,500
<i>They might just take it federal,</i>
<i>run wild on they ass.</i>

605
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,100
<i>And you know Joey gotta give</i>
<i>Lavell's corner to someone, right?</i>

606
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,900
<i>- Might be my turn.</i>
- Our boy won't shut up.

607
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,100
Caroline, you say that like it's a bad thing.

608
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,100
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.

609
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,700
Oh, I heard about you, man.
I hear your name used to ring out.

610
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,000
You got something for me?

611
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,600
You see where shorty's sitting at
right there?

612
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,000
You'll find a little help.

613
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,500
But when you ready, we got
some real work for you, all right?

614
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Jesus.

615
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,700
Hey. How you doing?

616
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Okay.

617
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,000
- We were just talking about you.
- Really?

618
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,800
- You know Denise, from the sorority.
- Hi.

619
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,100
Charles, of course.

620
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,400
- Always a pleasure, Lieutenant.
- Good to see you.

621
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,500
And I don't think you've met
Delegate Watkins.

622
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,900
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

623
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,300
We were saying
you fill out a lieutenant's uniform nicely.

624
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,700
- Makes an impression on the campaign lit.
- That matters?

625
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,500
Well, Marla's a new face
taking on a longtime incumbent.

626
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,200
- Everything matters, I'm afraid.
- Well, anything I can do to help.

627
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
I'll get out of the way
and leave you all to it.

628
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,800
Marla, I have to tell you that your photo
with Cedric works really well...

629
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,000
on the mailer.

630
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,500
Yeah. I sure hope
he knows what he's in for...

631
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,700
because it's gonna be a long race
for the both of you.

632
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,500
And that is not going to go easy.

633
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Speaking of which,
you've got to make <i>some...</i>

634
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,100
Jesus. Who called the media?

635
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,800
<i>No, you think the man might respect</i>
<i>my shit enough to let me step up.</i>

636
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,200
<i>- But it ain't even go like that.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

637
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300
<i>He gonna give Lavell's corner</i>
<i>to that off-brand nigger, Cheese.</i>

638
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,600
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>Joe's my uncle and shit.</i>

639
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,100
<i>I mean, I'm kin to the fat motherfucker.</i>

640
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,500
That idiot works for us,
he'd be a deputy commissioner by now.

641
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,300
Ain't no luck at all to this case.

642
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,400
<i>And how, in all good conscience, can I,</i>
<i>as chairman of this subcommittee...</i>

643
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,300
<i>authorize any more</i>
<i>above-the-line overtime...</i>

644
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
<i>when it's clear enough from the data</i>
<i>in front of me...</i>

645
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,700
<i>that that money is not gonna go</i>
<i>to line officers, or working detectives...</i>

646
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,200
<i>but is being used to pay for drivers</i>
<i>and clerical and...</i>

647
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,400
<i>And Jesus, look at this,</i>
<i>so that two colonels...</i>

648
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,200
<i>and three majors can attend a community</i>
<i>policing seminar in Miami, Florida.</i>

649
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,500
<i>Mr. Chairman...</i>

650
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
<i>What does South Beach</i>
<i>have to teach this department...</i>

651
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,900
<i>about making Baltimore</i>
<i>a safer place, Commissioner?</i>

652
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
<i>I have no idea and you have no idea,</i>
<i>and it is an embarrassment.</i>

653
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,700
Cedric, they're gone.

654
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,200
I wanna thank you for this.

655
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,100
No problem.

656
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,200
It's not easy, I know.

657
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,600
But they seem to think it matters
that I present myself <i>as...</i>

658
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm fine with it.

659
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,100
All those years
you were all about my career.

660
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Well, it's the least I can do, right?

661
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,800
Good night.

662
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,400
We're not holding anything up
in his district.

663
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,900
Repaving, foot patrols, <i>streetlights...</i>

664
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,200
He's getting his share.

665
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,500
Unless it's not about his district...

666
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,300
it's about him.

667
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,900
Maybe he's got big eyes for something.

668
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
For what?

669
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,700
Not me, not my chair, not in this town.

670
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Oh, no. If that guy came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.

671
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,500
But if that's it, come on with it.

672
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,400
- In fact, please, Jesus.
- Or maybe John the Baptist.

673
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,500
Soften you up for someone else.

674
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,800
- Lf he's gonna bang us on crime...
- Bang me on crime.

675
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,200
Look, is there any way
for you to talk to this guy?

676
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,000
- Keep him from crawling up my ass?
- He's old First District.

677
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,800
Not a lot of favors we can call in
over that side of town.

678
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,700
Well, we've got to show him
something, right?

679
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,700
- Four to five percent drop in felonies.
- And murders.

680
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,800
Get the murders down to under 250
for the year.

681
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,800
All due respect, Mr. Mayor,
we're at 232 now.

682
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,400
What can you realistically do?

683
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,700
Our best case scenario,
if we bump overtime, is...

684
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,900
275, maybe.

685
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,800
- 275, Christ.
- That's a promise, right?

686
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,600
275...

687
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,200
and this asshole Carcetti has no issue.

688
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,400
<i>Gentlemen, the word from on high</i>
<i>is that felony rates district by district...</i>

689
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,100
<i>will decline by five percent</i>
<i>before the end of the year.</i>

690
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,400
<i>We are dealing in certainties.</i>
<i>You will reduce the UCR felonies...</i>

691
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,700
<i>by five percent or more, or...</i>

692
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,600
<i>I've always wanted to say this...</i>

693
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,200
<i>let no man come back alive.</i>

694
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,600
<i>In addition, we will hold</i>
<i>this year's murders to 275 or less.</i>

695
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,900
Christ.

696
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,200
<i>Feeling a little fazed, Colonel Foerster?</i>

697
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,200
<i>A little dyspeptic?</i>

698
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,200
<i>Dis-who? No, sir. I'm good to go.</i>

699
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,500
<i>Here's a fun fact for you people.</i>

700
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,300
<i>If Baltimore had New York's population...</i>

701
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,900
<i>we'd be clocking 4,000 murders a year</i>
<i>at this rate.</i>

702
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,600
<i>There is no excuse I will accept.</i>
<i>I don't care how you do it.</i>

703
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,500
<i>- Just fucking do it.</i>
- Deputy...

704
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,100
as familiar as we all are
with the urban crime environment...

705
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,200
I think we all understand
there are certain processes...

706
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,200
by which you can reduce the number
of overall felonies.

707
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,900
You can reclassify an agg assault...

708
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
or you can unfound a robbery...

709
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,800
but how do you make a body disappear?

710
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,300
There isn't one of you in this room
who isn't here by appointment.

711
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,300
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters...

712
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,100
you will shut up and step up.

713
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,300
Any of you who can't bring in
the numbers we need...

714
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,100
will be replaced by someone who can.

715
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,100
That is all.

716
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,000
Jesus, Bunny...

717
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,400
what got into you?

718
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,400
Another six months to my 30.
I'm out the door on a major's pension.

719
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,400
The hell they could do to me.

720
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Spider bags, red tops.

721
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,100
- Any other bright ideas?
- How about a bug?

722
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,200
A bug?

723
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,700
Yeah, bug one or two of the big corners
where these mopes hang.

724
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,900
Watching those corners over on Ashland
yesterday, I'm seeing dumpsters, weeds...

725
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,500
maybe a utility pole.

726
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,800
You hide a bug in the right corner
at the right moment, you make this case.

727
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,800
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.

728
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,300
And for what?
We're still a long way from a quality target.

729
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,700
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can, and move on.

730
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,100
We come down early two years ago
and we left a real bastard on the street.

731
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,600
You're telling me we're gonna let
that same son of a bitch beat me again?

732
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,800
How many times do you let a cocksucker
like Stringer Bell go around the board?

733
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,300
Collect another fucking $200 million.

734
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,000
- There's other fish in the barrel, McNulty.
- Stringer's the target.

735
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,500
There isn't a better fucker out there.
You know it, Lieutenant.

736
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,700
Don't you let him go soft on this.

737
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,700
It's you against the world, is it?

738
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,300
What the fuck did I do?

739
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,500
Red tops, spider bags!

740
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,700
You up?

741
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,300
Step the fuck off, motherfucker.

742
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,600
You got a need,
you talk to one of the young 'uns.

743
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,000
I ain't in the market. I'm selling.

744
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,500
You look like the right person
to be talking to, chief.

745
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,300
You seem like you steady
running this shit here.

746
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,200
What, are you some kind of police
or something?

747
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,800
I'm a long motherfucking way
from the police.

748
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,700
I just finished a 14-year bit in Jessup.

749
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,100
Got a package
as a coming-home present. G-pack.

750
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,600
Well, why not sell that shit your own self?

751
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,100
I just came home.
I ain't trying to get my ass violated.

752
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,200
- Even split.
- Shit.

753
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,400
- It's all profit to you.
- Risk mine, too.

754
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,400
What make you think
I ain't on paper or some shit?

755
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,000
Sixty-forty.

756
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,100
Cool. Give your shit to my boy.

757
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,900
- He good with it. Then come past tonight.
- All right.

758
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
<i>And one last item for you gents.</i>

759
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,800
<i>It seems that Foxtrot was hovering</i>
<i>over the stationhouse a few days ago...</i>

760
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,500
<i>and caught a lovely view of about 700 or</i>
<i>800 discarded beer cans on the garage roof.</i>

761
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,300
<i>Seriously, no off-duty drinking</i>
<i>on the station lot.</i>

762
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,600
<i>And if you do find yourself</i>
<i>holding a beer can...</i>

763
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,500
<i>don't throw it on the roof,</i>
<i>take it home with you.</i>

764
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,400
<i>Come on, guys, the memo came down</i>
<i>from our beloved Deputy of Operations.</i>

765
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,200
<i>All right, get out of here.</i>

766
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,500
<i>Don't get captured.</i>

767
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,200
At ease.

768
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,800
- Anything from day shift?
- Nothing that'll make the papers.

769
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,100
All right, then, I'm gonna ride the district
until the Deputy Major gets in.

770
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,100
If you need me, hit the radio.

771
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,200
Distribution?

772
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,700
Possession.

773
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,900
- And some loitering.
- Loitering?

774
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,300
And behaving like assholes
in the presence of sworn officers, boss.

775
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,100
Five-o creeping.

776
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,400
It's midnight relief coming in.

777
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,800
What the hell is all this?

778
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,800
You don't look at what you did before,
you do the same shit all over.

779
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,900
I'm out of here.

780
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,700
Spiders with a red top! One and one!

781
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,600
Where he at?

782
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Spider bags! Got those spider bags!

783
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,100
The fuck you looking at?

784
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,800
- What, do you want a go?
- Just my split.

785
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,700
Some bad luck there.

786
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,900
The police came through,
snatched up a ground stash or two.

787
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,100
Shit happened to be yours. Fuck, right?

788
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,600
- You got a number?
- A number?

789
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,900
Back in the day, when a player tried to say
he lost a package to the police...

790
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,500
he had to give up a number for the report.

791
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,700
Well, we ain't back in the day.

792
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,700
I'm getting fucking tired of your ass.

793
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,800
Yeah, walk it off, motherfucker.

794
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,800
Fucking old-school-ass bitch.

795
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,200
Got them spider bags. Two'll get you three.

796
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,100
- What?
- You up?

797
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,100
Spider bags, two gets three.

798
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,900
You up or you not?

799
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,300
What you doing, boy?

800
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,900
Oh, man! Dumb rookie.

801
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
Don't you know five-o?
