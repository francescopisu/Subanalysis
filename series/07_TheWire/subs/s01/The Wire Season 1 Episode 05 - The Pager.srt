00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,341
...the big fat morning show.

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,876
Now, you wanna play
the brand new big fat game:

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,775
big fat match game, call us now...

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:17,975
Hello?

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,145
Hello?

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,517
Who was that?

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,122
- They hung up without saying.
- They hung up without saying?

9
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,995
What you care?

10
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,593
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.

11
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,552
What's up, baby?

12
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:30,383
I need you to get
them phone lines up out that house.

13
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,481
Out of the apartment? Why?

14
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,026
I'm saying, what Chantay gonna say...

15
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,392
about not havin' no line in her own place?

16
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,759
All right. Got you.

17
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:44,127
What's up, baby, you got a problem?

18
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,068
- Good.
- I'm just sayin' though, man...

19
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,299
it seem we just goin' past careful, man...

20
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,705
with all of this, man.

21
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,108
Like we buggin' out or something.
You know, like we paranoid and shit.

22
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,482
Naw, I don't wanna use this phone.
We used this phone yesterday.

23
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,184
What you blowing out your mouth for, man?

24
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,453
You act like...

25
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,655
Ain't nobody out to get me, man.
I got no motherfuckin' enemies.

26
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,820
Naw, man.

27
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,334
We all right.

28
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,790
All right, this gonna be so easy...

29
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,803
them Eastside chumps,
they ain't nothing like Avon's people.

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,770
Watch, y'all gonna see.

31
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,838
All right, now y'all gonna be here, right?

32
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,872
Hold up.

33
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,771
Yo, Boo!

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,246
I'm gonna slide up through here.

35
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,113
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.

36
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:14,419
Yo!

37
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,157
Yo, Maurice short, man.

38
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,889
- How short?
- Three.

39
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,862
Tell him to grow a couple of inches.

40
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,935
Where you gonna be at?

41
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,840
That be the trap right there, homes.

42
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,937
You figure they roll
through the alley for sure?

43
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,813
Man, rats always run
to holes in times of danger.

44
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,810
And you him, ain't you?

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,911
- Who?
- Danger.

46
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,224
Naw, man, I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

47
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,816
And a shotgun.

48
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,923
For sure.

49
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,829
Sorry I'm late.

50
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,401
Got myself lost down the other hallway.

51
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:08,037
- That leads to the loading dock.
- Yeah, and deep storage.

52
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,276
So, this is where they put you?

53
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,140
Quite a message they're sending.

54
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,271
- Yeah, and that message is...
- Out of sight, out of mind.

55
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,441
Spoken like a true troglodyte.

56
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,585
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

57
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,680
The foundation of your case, Detective.

58
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,986
You lay it in right, you can build on it.

59
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,688
You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.

60
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,058
We ready?

61
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,991
Do you solemnly swear and affirm
that the affidavit is true...

62
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,229
and accurate to the best of your knowledge?

63
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,326
- I do.
- I do.

64
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:42,430
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

65
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,006
- Did he swear already?
- The state's attorney?

66
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,101
Yeah.

67
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,202
I see it.

68
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,110
Second copy is sealed for the court,
and the police get the others.

69
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,446
How's this work?

70
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,245
Same frequency as the one
carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.

71
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,687
He gets a page, we get a page.

72
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,426
- So, we up now?
- It's official.

73
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,357
- You're up.
- Then let the game begin.

74
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,031
Celebrities always seem much smaller
when you meet them in person.

75
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,541
Yo!

76
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,840
Yo!

77
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,787
Check it out, here he come.

78
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:36,852
- Somethin' ain't right, yo.
- Watch out, man, he got that boom.

79
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,327
- He's packing.
- Here he come.

80
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,230
Yo, come on, Omar's coming, man!

81
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,827
Oh, shit!

82
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,019
Yeah...

83
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,260
the cheese stands alone.

84
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,432
- How you know?
- 'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.

85
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,928
Yo, he saying you can't catch the bug...

86
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,768
just by getting your dick sucked.

87
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,037
Dumb-ass, you gotta be
in some pussy to get it, all right?

88
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,012
Man, wear a coat if you want,
don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.

89
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,810
How would you know?

90
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,888
Who you trying to fuck anyway?

91
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,655
Arletta Mouzone. Treenee's cousin.

92
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,394
Damn, man, in that case
use a big-ass condom, all right?

93
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,830
You need a trash bag. Fuck that.

94
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,630
I wouldn't run up in that bitch
with D'Angelo's dick...

95
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,829
It's triflin'.

96
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,092
Easy to see why niggers come
around here stealing our shit!

97
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,129
Yo, you know what, nigger?

98
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,600
What?

99
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,069
Forget it.

100
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,476
142 isn't a working telephone exchange.

101
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,642
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't working numbers?

102
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,117
Something wrong with the recorder?

103
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,657
We're getting what you'd expect,
seven digits of a telephone number...

104
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,125
and a two-digit add-on to identify the caller,
like here, 13.

105
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,493
McNulty, line one.

106
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,625
- Yeah.
- Did you just get a 142 exchange?

107
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,292
Yeah, that's what we got, too.

108
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,394
- That's fucked up.
- All right, later.

109
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,304
He's got the same numbers
on the readout of the cloned pagers.

110
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,844
So it's not the recorder.

111
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,437
These mopes are using a code
to cover their calls?

112
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,415
- That's pretty damn sophisticated.
- What is?

113
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,987
They've coded the telephone numbers
in their pager messages.

114
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,147
How do you know?

115
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,589
Every time the Barksdale kid's pager
goes off...

116
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,786
this machine gives us a message and time.

117
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,921
McNulty's carrying a cloned pager,
but this is what we use in court.

118
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,430
Same with those pen registers.

119
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,502
Every time a pay phone
in the low-rise court is used...

120
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,198
we get the telephone number,
the time and the duration of the call.

121
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,600
Incoming calls, too.

122
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,574
Spy shit. Very cool.

123
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,237
You say they're using some kind of code?

124
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,645
Yeah, they got to be.
These numbers don't make no fuckin' sense.

125
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,946
- You rang?
- Omar's ride.

126
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,285
Bubbles spotted it.

127
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:57,260
Different tags, no stolen report,
these come back right for the van...

128
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,729
but Bubs makes it
by the cargo rack on the roof.

129
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,029
Good scope. You wanna take him?

130
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,495
Can't hurt to try.

131
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,032
We pop Omar, get a gun,
he might let us work him.

132
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,075
Anything coming through on the pager?

133
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:16,609
Eight hits so far,
most of them in some kind of code.

134
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,081
These ain't Baltimore exchanges,
that's for sure.

135
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:24,644
Three weeks to get Daniels to agree,
a week to write out the affidavit...

136
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,054
and then this bullshit.

137
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,825
How complex a code can it be
if these knuckleheads are using it?

138
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,097
Then again, what does it say
about us if we can't break it?

139
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,733
You wanna run Bubs back downtown,
I'll sit here and wait for you.

140
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,031
All right.

141
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,371
- What'd I miss, girlfriend?
- Not a goddamn thing.

142
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,708
Yeah, boring, ain't we?

143
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,312
How y'all do what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

144
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,311
That's what I be asking.

145
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,653
It's been a little hectic down here,
right, cuz?

146
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,460
String, man, I can't lie.

147
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,769
Them stick-up boys,
they caught us dead up.

148
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,498
And the knockos, shit,
I don't know what the fuck that was.

149
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,301
5-0. Comin' up!

150
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,173
- 5-0 comin' up, y'all.
- Time-out.

151
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,373
- C'mon, man, what is that?
- What?

152
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,643
You gotta get your crew
to understand that...

153
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,878
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...

154
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,545
that give us the most trouble.

155
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,555
When they start thinking like that...

156
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,182
you're not gonna have any more surprises,
you feel me?

157
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,488
'Cause you know, your uncle and me...

158
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,428
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.

159
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,591
- What?
- Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.

160
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,428
And you gotta be on that, right?
You gotta be on that.

161
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm gonna tell you what you do.

162
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,074
What day is it today, Friday?

163
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,701
What happen on Friday?

164
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,810
- Payday.
- Not this Friday.

165
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:57,904
Why not?

166
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,818
No, what you gonna do
is you gonna call 'em...

167
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,614
like you gonna pay 'em
and then you crack 'em.

168
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,245
You tell 'em you're not happy...

169
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,586
with what they fuckin' pass
as work down here.

170
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,957
And when you're not happy,
they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?

171
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,589
Yeah, but String, you don't pay a nigger,
he ain't gonna work for you.

172
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,963
What, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?

173
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,502
You think these niggers
gonna be like, "Fuck it...

174
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,799
"let me quit this game here
and go to college"?

175
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,467
Naw, they gonna buck a little,
but they not gonna walk.

176
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,169
- And in the end, you gonna get respect.
- Yeah.

177
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,646
And when that money run out, they'll
come up to you and roll on you...

178
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,781
and ask you for an advance and shit,
when they flat-ass broke.

179
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,290
Them the niggers
that you strike off your list.

180
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,054
But that nigger that stay eatin'...

181
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,931
the nigger that steady rollin',
ain't askin' you for shit...

182
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,659
that's the nigger I want
to hear about. Understand?

183
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,737
Yeah, man, shit, you know how
to play a nigger into a corner, String.

184
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,142
- Yo, take care of this right here.
- You my favorite girl.

185
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,879
Shit, let me handle this, man.

186
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,315
- Yo, Poot.
- Yeah, I...

187
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,388
- Come here, man.
- What's happening?

188
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,221
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

189
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,088
You know the fuckin' rules.

190
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,018
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Copying.

191
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,791
A telephone.

192
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,318
This fucking detail is too much for me.

193
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,530
It's after 3:00.

194
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,798
So, where are the boys at?

195
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,468
Maybe they only come out at night.

196
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,176
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.

197
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,251
Guy named Reuben Terry.

198
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:15,912
Is he good?

199
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,319
Saw the street like we wish we could.

200
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,458
Ain't nothing like a good Cl.

201
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,258
School's out.

202
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,167
Can I use your cell phone?

203
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:47,247
Yeah, I got that. I did.

204
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:52,881
I know.

205
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,424
I don't know about this...

206
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,427
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- How can I trust you...

207
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,488
For chrissakes, Elena, I'm their father.
You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?

208
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,692
Yes, I got them.

209
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,466
Sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.

210
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,699
I fuckin' got them.

211
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,967
What color are they?

212
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,976
Color, what the fuck do you care
what color they are? Hello?

213
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,444
- Lost her.
- I bet.

214
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,984
You know something?

215
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:27,288
My ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes,
the way she deals with shit...

216
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:34,588
you would think a less enlightened man
than myself, cruder man than myself...

217
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,602
a man less sensitized to the qualities
and charms and value of women...

218
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,299
a man like that, not me, but a man like that,
he just might call her a cunt.

219
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,876
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

220
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,445
No, I did not call her that.

221
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,480
- Yes, you fuckin' did.
- No, I did not.

222
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,049
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.

223
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,486
5-0, gotta go.
Whoa, man, get out the way!

224
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,054
Shit.

225
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,135
Not much fighting this time.
You getting tired, asshole?

226
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,568
Still dragging from
the whupping Kima put on him.

227
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,765
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?

228
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,366
That's one thing about Kima,
she put a hurtin' on you like a man.

229
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,341
Get your monkey ass up.

230
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:27,245
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?

231
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,946
Come on.

232
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,152
From Bantry Bay to the Derry Quay

233
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,663
And from Galway to Dublin town

234
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,825
Well, I've never seen

235
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,828
My brown Colleen

236
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,438
That I met in the County Down

237
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,909
There's a man in the County Down

238
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,621
There's a man in the County Down

239
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,557
First, I go in, play nice.

240
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,392
- Then you come in, play bad.
- I ain't gonna be playin'.

241
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,804
Bracelet too tight?

242
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,430
You rackin' up all kinds of points, ain't you?

243
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:52,560
First, you put a cop in the hospital,
damn near kill his ass with that punch.

244
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,635
Now, you on the wing from Boys' Village.

245
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,800
Man, I'm 16, all right?
What the fuck they gonna do to me?

246
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,874
That's the least of your worries, my friend.

247
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,815
I got a partner outside who can't wait
to get in here and fuck you up.

248
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,685
Cop you banged was Hero's uncle.

249
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,115
Herc wants off the leash on this one.

250
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:18,060
And I suppose you
at the other end of that leash?

251
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,369
See, I don't want to play it that way.

252
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,536
I know about comin' up hard and all.

253
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:35,638
Why, you came up hard?

254
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,316
Flag House projects. Eastside.

255
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,618
Yeah, Flag House?

256
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,722
You know, you remind me of me.

257
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,732
I'm thinking we should work something out.

258
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:01,566
What do I get?

259
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,408
What you want?

260
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,679
I want...

261
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,484
for you to suck my dick.

262
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,867
I'll beat your fuckin' monkey ass.

263
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,536
You supposed to be the good cop,
dumb motherfucker.

264
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,972
What?

265
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,823
- Hello, may I help you?
- Yeah, we'd like a table.

266
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,584
And you have reservations?

267
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,151
Naw, I thought, you know,
we could just walk in...

268
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,094
Let me see what I got.

269
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,959
That's two?

270
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,097
Follow me, please.

271
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,017
Your coat, ma'am?

272
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:26,055
- Can we get that one, over there?
- It's Friday night...

273
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,182
those are for patrons
who made reservations.

274
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,227
Let me get your chair for you, ma'am.

275
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,262
- It's okay, man, all right.
- Here you are.

276
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,269
Here you are, sir.

277
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,807
Your waiter will be with you shortly.

278
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,072
You shoulda pushed him, Dee.

279
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,898
Bastards.

280
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,517
Sarge, nobody answers at juvenile intake
and we been calling.

281
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,755
Clearly, they're not
as dedicated as you two detectives.

282
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,764
So what time does
the duty intake consultant get here?

283
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:45,165
You missed the 8:00.
You got another one around midnight.

284
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,639
- Midnight?
- You think maybe if we left you...

285
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,938
the paperwork, you could put him
in the box 'til intake gets here?

286
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,955
Hemorrhoid.

287
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,907
For the crumbs.

288
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,942
Yeah, right.

289
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,306
- You like your dinner?
- Yeah.

290
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:36,116
- That shrimp was right.
- Yeah, it was good, right?

291
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,226
Think they know?

292
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,395
Do they know what?

293
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,057
You know. What I'm about.

294
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,996
What you mean, Dee?

295
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,666
Come on, you know, it's like...

296
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:58,474
we get all dressed up, right?

297
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,477
Come all the way across town.
Fancy place like this.

298
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,275
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.

299
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,179
Walk around a little bit, you know?

300
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,878
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?

301
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,649
So? Your money good, right?

302
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,087
Dee, we ain't the only black people in here.

303
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:21,393
It ain't what I'm talking about.
It's about where we... Come on, you know.

304
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:26,035
I'm just saying, you know,
I feel like some shit just stay with you...

305
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,500
you know what I'm saying,
like, hard as you try...

306
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:32,132
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?

307
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,974
- Can I interest you in dessert?
- Yes, thank you.

308
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,950
- Can I have some chocolate cake?
- I'll bring the cart.

309
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,747
Boy, don't nobody give a damn
about you and your story.

310
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,089
You got money,
you get to be whatever you say you are.

311
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,958
That's the way it is.

312
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,193
Sir, I'm sorry. These are the samples.

313
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,936
And for you, sir? Very good.

314
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,389
Don't be a bitch, admit it.

315
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,422
Go ahead.

316
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:29,193
- Admit you're wrong, be a man.
- Yeah, I gotta confess...

317
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,994
this sub beats chink-ass Bob's by a mile.

318
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:33,538
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...

319
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,632
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...

320
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,369
but you can't do shit with that stick, man.

321
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,373
- You'd do better.
- I play.

322
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,214
Says he plays.

323
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,775
He might.

324
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,184
I'm even better with two hands.

325
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,190
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

326
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,254
Except for that nigger, Scar,
from New York...

327
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,587
Edmondson gully is wide open.

328
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,062
What about Tee-Tee's crew?

329
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,135
Naw, them niggers dried up
when they took that federal charge.

330
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:06,760
Most of 'em laid up somewhere,
gettin' high and shit.

331
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:10,363
I'll tell you what. You holler at the boy Scar.

332
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,103
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.

333
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,271
If he give you any beef at all,
we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.

334
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,781
- All right.
- And then once we got him outta there...

335
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:22,751
we'll send in the smokers to run out
all the little poop-butt locals and shit.

336
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,652
Or, if you think
there's some cats in there who got game...

337
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,988
- then we put 'em on our team.
- All right, who you want to run it?

338
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,856
- Send Stinkum up here.
- All right.

339
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,988
He the one who saw the shot.
So, he gets a shot.

340
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,373
All right, okay, not bad.

341
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,811
Can't let the duty officer see that.

342
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,575
You wanna give it a rest, man?
You down $60.

343
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,278
That might be your whole damn salary,
but I clock that shit in minutes.

344
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,947
- Rack 'em and break 'em, man.
- You the guys waiting for juvenile intake?

345
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,820
He's in the squad room.

346
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,728
If I had more time, I'd run you.

347
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,265
Give you a tip, Preston.

348
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,793
You gonna run a hustle,
you best stay with what you know.

349
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,699
Man, fuck you and your
tired-ass advice, all right?

350
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,308
But that sandwich was good.

351
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,952
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

352
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:38,653
Take the gully.

353
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,690
What about Scar?

354
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,025
Who?

355
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,064
Listen, I'm giving you points
on the package...

356
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,375
so, you make a go of it, you hear me?

357
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:57,008
You working for yourself, too,
so you gonna put out the strong product...

358
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,310
and you gonna get the locals behind it.

359
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,477
It's as simple as that.
You get your team together, you feel me?

360
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,045
Go and wait for me downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute, man.

361
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:10,992
- We gonna make this money run in a few.
- Smile or something, nigger.

362
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,663
- Made that nigger's night.
- Yeah, he deserved it, though.

363
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,927
He deserved it.

364
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,264
It's Wee-Bey. We got one.

365
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,740
- You think it's Omar?
- Nah.

366
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:30,472
- It's one of the young 'uns, I think.
- One down, two to go, right?

367
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,273
Yeah, motherfuckers. Try to rob me, baby.

368
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,060
One, two, three.

369
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,428
- A winner.
- A match? Which case?

370
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,163
The one you just brought me, Bunk.
Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.

371
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,239
- Kresson?
- Diedre Kresson, right, yeah.

372
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,070
She matches up with two other cases,
both from last year.

373
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,441
- Which ones?
- Toreen Boyle...

374
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:12,448
- Someone named Ligget. It's in the report.
- It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

375
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,676
Yeah, them.

376
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:18,017
Casings from all three killings go to a .45,
probably Colt Classic.

377
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,553
- That fucker Landsman. How's he do it?
- You like Landsman for these three?

378
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,922
I don't know, Bunk.

379
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:28,727
As sergeants go, Jay's a sociopath and all,
but I'd have to go with an actual gangster.

380
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,366
Jimmy, you sitting down?

381
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,133
I said it was hot, but if you
got these barbecue gloves.

382
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,099
You got a Johnny Weeks up in here?

383
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,836
- Who?
- Johnny Weeks.

384
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,378
- Over in the game room.
- Obliged.

385
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,971
- Any smokes?
- I'm out.

386
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,984
How long have you been here?
You gotta give the medication...

387
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,986
a chance to work in your system, man.

388
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,991
Brought you something.

389
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,063
Yeah, some chicken pieces and some fries.

390
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,840
Bought you a shake,
but I dropped it on the bus.

391
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,181
It comes in a bag, goes out in a bag.

392
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,085
How long you have that for?

393
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,062
- I fucked up, man.
- Yeah, I saw.

394
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,384
- I fucked up, man.
- Yeah, I saw.

395
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,363
There was nothing I could do, you know?

396
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,670
It's like first I got beat,
right, then I get this.

397
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,604
What are these for?

398
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,207
They say I got the bug.

399
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,115
The bug?

400
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:00,087
They checked me when
I was in the hospital...

401
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,419
Are they sure?

402
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,368
Where you been at?

403
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,598
Here and there, I'm at it.

404
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,505
I'd have come past sooner,
but I been on kinda like a mission.

405
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,272
- A mission?
- Yeah. Them hoppers that beat you down...

406
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,642
they got problems now.

407
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,909
Them and the people they sling for, even.

408
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,006
What?

409
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,286
I put the police on their ass.

410
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:32,689
Police?

411
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,088
- What, you get locked up or something?
- No, come on.

412
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,060
No, I'm not working for them.
I'm working with them.

413
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,956
They don't give me the badge soon enough,
I keep doing like I do.

414
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,165
Why?

415
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,303
What do you mean why?
How can you ask me why?

416
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:53,640
Why the fuck are you in here, man,
with all these falling-down motherfuckers?

417
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,871
Why you passing shit through a bag?

418
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,006
Why they beat you down?

419
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,810
Why I couldn't do nothing about it?

420
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,877
It's all part of the game, right?

421
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,218
I mean, you taught me that.

422
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,666
What you up to in here, man?

423
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,975
- Doing the meetings.
- N.A.?

424
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,472
Yeah. Twice a day.

425
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,140
That's good, man. It's good,
you give the body comfort, you know.

426
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,551
- Yeah.
- No, you needed a change.

427
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,613
Guess so.

428
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,987
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.

429
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,222
It's all right. They got meetings everywhere.

430
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,355
You ain't gotta worry about that.

431
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,258
Bubs.

432
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,741
Who's got the best package now?

433
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,968
- Get the fuck out of here, man.
- I'm coming home, right?

434
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,440
Shit is weak all over, you know?

435
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,282
Got some boys up in Baker
and Calhoun, though.

436
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,515
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

437
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,955
- Yeah?
- Knocked a couple of niggers out.

438
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,591
Ain't you a trip?

439
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:21,326
Beat down, bagged up,
still ready to rip and run, huh?

440
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,330
I'm a Viking, homes.

441
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,635
"I'm a Viking, homes."

442
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,173
McNulty.

443
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,409
There's something here that needs kissing.

444
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,484
Speak again, toothless one.

445
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:46,954
I guess you know now why I wear
the stripes in the family.

446
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,152
Good call, Jay. Of course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked the scene up...

447
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,161
you'd have had that casing
months ago, right?

448
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,493
Keeley. Let Keeley be Keeley.

449
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,294
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?

450
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:58,968
Speaking of which...

451
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,327
sit down.

452
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,136
May I ask you a question
that is essential to your career?

453
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:09,235
- What?
- Who do you serve?

454
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,714
I am asking you to identify for the record
your commanding officer.

455
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,514
- Major Rawls.
- Excellent.

456
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:20,987
And with that thought in mind, I advise you
to go immediately into the Major's office...

457
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,583
carrying the break
I've given you in the Kresson case...

458
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,423
and kiss the man's ring. Because...

459
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,123
I have talked you right out of the shithouse.

460
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:29,863
Here's the deal.

461
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,662
You wrap up this thing
with Narcotics in two weeks.

462
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,898
You put yourself back in the rotation
when we go back to night work.

463
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:38,702
You do that and you're back in the fold.

464
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,508
- Thanks, Jay.
- No problem.

465
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,472
Shit ain't right.

466
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,518
You work, you get paid.

467
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,119
That's what I'm saying.

468
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,018
I'm gonna say something to him, all right?

469
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,353
- You should.
- Truth.

470
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,386
- What's up, Dee?
- What's up, Shorty?

471
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,233
$530, the count is right, man.

472
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:10,464
Okay, re-ups on the way down.

473
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,508
Go tell Sterling to be ready for it.

474
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,271
All right. Yo, Dee, man.

475
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,578
You know, me and Poot,
we been steady working it, you know?

476
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,809
Nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?

477
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:22,242
No.

478
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,983
And we was wondering if, maybe you could
let a little something go...

479
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,993
until payday, 'cause you know, right now,
we some broke-ass niggers, man.

480
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,408
Right now, whoever did our girl...

481
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,501
also did Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.

482
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,910
- Leggett.
- And those two are definitely...

483
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,949
straight-up drug executions.

484
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,147
No mention of Dee in either file.

485
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,584
But I did get a fresh number...

486
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,579
- on Tywanda.
- Who?

487
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:02,825
The girl who called in on Kresson.

488
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,326
- Right.
- She put Dee in for that.

489
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,861
Have you seen this?

490
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,193
Jaybird.

491
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:13,996
And the bear said, "You didn't
really come here to hunt now, did you?"

492
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,501
- You see Saturday's 24s?
- Sunday morning.

493
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,737
Did you see the one Worden
got on the Westside?

494
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,373
John Bailey, in a Kevlar vest,
lit up by three separate shooters.

495
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,309
Carey Street.

496
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,010
You made the Kresson connection...

497
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,553
you didn't think Bailey might tie in
with Barksdale?

498
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:36,456
Worden's on the other shift.
I'm trying to work my murders, Jesus Christ.

499
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,759
Tony, Line 3.

500
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,725
What took you so long?

501
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,595
You might've heard, we get a few murders
here in Baltimore...

502
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,032
sometimes we just get backed up.

503
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:48,127
- You weren't followed here?
- Why would we be followed?

504
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,836
Diedre was playing with scary people.

505
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,807
Who might that be?

506
00:36:57,314 --> 00:37:00,909
You called this in after the murder
and you told the detective...

507
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,452
that you talked to her
the night she was killed.

508
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,351
She called. It was late.

509
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,517
She didn't talk long, she said she had to go.
Dee was at the door.

510
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,788
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?

511
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,696
- Yeah, she was killed that night.
- Dee was her boyfriend?

512
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,765
No, Dee was his nephew or something.

513
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,269
Dee would be D'Angelo Barksdale.

514
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,597
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

515
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,707
You know Avon?

516
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,011
The question is how do you know him?

517
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,581
You out there running
the street with the players?

518
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,206
I used to be...

519
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,351
but not after this thing with Diedre.
I mean, damn.

520
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,183
We used to go to Odell's for ladies' nights...

521
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,793
and one time he was there with all
his people in one of the big booths...

522
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,921
ordering drinks,
acting like he was king of everything.

523
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,429
And Diedre ate that shit up.

524
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,793
- And you?
- I ain't gonna lie.

525
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,106
I did the club thing for a while, but...

526
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,977
some of those places,
everybody in there's on some kind of game.

527
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,775
But Diedre went with Avon?

528
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,975
She was with Avon for like a year...

529
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:11,214
and something happened. Toward the end,
she started getting real possessive...

530
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,257
and that didn't sit with Avon,
'cause he has other girls, too.

531
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,223
She started bitching on him one minute...

532
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,160
crying the next minute,
threatening to do all kinds of things.

533
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,494
- She threatened Avon Barksdale?
- The girl was off the hook.

534
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,765
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

535
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,566
- A letter.
- A letter to the state's attorney.

536
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,372
Supposed to be some sort of kin to her.

537
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:35,242
She said that if he dumped her...

538
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,473
she was gonna tell about the drugs.

539
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:40,315
- Did she write this letter?
- I don't know.

540
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,944
I tried talking to her about the way she
was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.

541
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:48,821
She even had it out with him in his club
one night in front of all the people.

542
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,223
What, Avon has a club?

543
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,625
Orlando's, titty bar.

544
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,331
- Does he own it?
- That's what Diedre said.

545
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,099
She said he owned a whole mess of stuff.

546
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,615
- Tell me something, man.
- What's that?

547
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,357
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

548
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:21,446
Shit.

549
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,427
You try dealing with all these bitches
and their problems for a few days.

550
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:29,659
Get so you'd rather be running a goddamn
laundromat out this fucker.

551
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,361
Heard you're doing okay in the Pit.

552
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,638
- Yeah, well.
- What, you ain't getting it like that?

553
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,069
Man, my uncle
still got me working on salary.

554
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,405
Damn, boy.

555
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,106
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

556
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:45,303
What?

557
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,876
Come on, man, you ain't making no ends?

558
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,953
I know you getting
something on this by now.

559
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,043
No, man.

560
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:54,414
I'm just the front,
clean name for the liquor board.

561
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,288
- I'm saying...
- What the fuck?

562
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,226
Is there a problem?
That was for the drink before.

563
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,261
It was for this one.

564
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,197
It ain't like I'm calling your uncle out
or nothing...

565
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,633
but give a nigger a chance.
Plenty of pie out there for everybody.

566
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,704
Believe.

567
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,434
You heard Stinkum gonna be coming off
the clock, right? Getting a percentage.

568
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,874
- What?
- Open up fresh territory.

569
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,844
Take over the corners
down near Edmondson and Brice.

570
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:20,339
So, my uncle gave that to Stink?

571
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,549
Figured you knew.

572
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,248
Orlando!

573
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,883
Excuse me, Orlando,
can you help me down here, please?

574
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:32,189
- I already paid for that last drink.
- That was for the drink before.

575
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,560
- Hell, no, that was for this one.
- What's up here?

576
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,862
Look, he ain't paid for that drink
and I took $20 off the bar.

577
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,994
- Look she took $20, then $20 more.
- Hell I did.

578
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,673
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?

579
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,299
I been with you for an hour and a half
buying drinks.

580
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,574
Look, man, this ain't right.
I just spent $120 in drinks, $40 in tips.

581
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,976
Now, you gonna take all that
and still try to sneak into my pocket?

582
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,053
- Shit, girl!
- You got to go, get him the fuck outta here.

583
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,384
I ain't done so much as touch your kneecap.

584
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,187
Trying to treat her with a little respect,
and this is the way you do me?

585
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,658
Wait, wait!

586
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,867
Why you do that?

587
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:24,814
- Did you take his money?
- No, I didn't take his money.

588
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,553
You buying me a drink?

589
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,423
Can I see you sometime?

590
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:45,093
Like, you know, not in here.

591
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,246
I don't usually see men that I meet in here.

592
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,450
Usually.

593
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,493
What kind of strip joint has
a video camera looking out?

594
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,691
More to it than the girls, maybe.

595
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:21,499
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse...

596
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,267
he's got the apartment building
by Druid Hill Lake...

597
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:26,205
he's got the tow truck company...

598
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,269
and that's just what she knew from
what he bragged about to the dead girl.

599
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:33,614
- Major likes assets.
- The Deputy, too, I imagine.

600
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,915
Nothing like a few property forfeitures
to swell the departmental operation budget.

601
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:40,353
Check city assessments to see
who owns the club.

602
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,722
Run the company name through
the state corporate charter office.

603
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,388
Also, Homicide picked up one
Saturday night. Might be one of ours.

604
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,533
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist
I used to know from the Murphy homes.

605
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,626
He was wearing Kevlar, but it didn't help.

606
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,570
39 casings on the scene,
from three different guns.

607
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,931
Overkill for a burn bag...

608
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,741
but about right if he was running with Omar.

609
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,472
Lookit, our buddy.

610
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,954
Just once, I wish they'd use
the right number.

611
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,729
Ain't like him to be late.

612
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:37,473
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend.
I'm telling you...

613
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,683
them fucking people ain't to be relied on.

614
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,215
Why you always gotta talk like that, man?

615
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,788
- What?
- "F" this and "f" that.

616
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:51,554
If I give it up,
I lose half of what I mean to say.

617
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,092
Don't nobody want
to hear them dirty words, man.

618
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,394
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.

619
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:14,714
Wait for Bailey?

620
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,212
Early bird catches the worm, dog.

621
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,849
- I beeped you.
- I didn't get it.

622
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,918
- Let me see.
- You want to see my pager?

623
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:55,853
Sure, Prez, you want to see my pager?

624
00:44:57,627 --> 00:44:59,959
- I beeped you too.
- You all right, Prez?

625
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:02,429
714-3432?

626
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,891
I got that. That was you?

627
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:07,494
You try it?

628
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,766
Yeah, I tried it. Twice.

629
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:11,572
Non-working number.

630
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,641
It would've worked if you knew the code.

631
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,446
Shit, I'm as surprised as you.

632
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,850
I like word-search puzzles.

633
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,756
You know, where you gotta
find the hidden words?

634
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,260
So, I thought I could do the same thing
with the numbers.

635
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,560
Take the number I sent you.

636
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:39,395
Now, take the seven
and jump it over the five.

637
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,960
You get three.

638
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,104
Jump the one over the five...

639
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:45,734
you get nine.

640
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,035
With four you get six.

641
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:52,078
Three, that's seven, four is six...

642
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,672
a three again...

643
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,978
and two is eight.

644
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,850
Zero switches with the five.

645
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,924
So 714-3432 is...

646
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:07,395
396-7678.

647
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:09,496
Our number.

648
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,835
And that's the code?

649
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,934
And it works, because it's all about
where the buttons are on a phone.

650
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,105
If it was a code that involved math...

651
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:21,904
or algebra or whatever...

652
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,573
these little yos in the projects
wouldn't be able to follow along.

653
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:29,315
But with this, all you gotta do
is jump the five button.

654
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,478
Ain't no math to it. It's just...

655
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,019
how a phone looks when you look at it.

656
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,615
Prez, you little genius!

657
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:40,994
- Jesus.
- I could kill you, that's so good.

658
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,433
Your mother keep ragging at me...

659
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:49,869
to take him outta here and put him
in a private nursing home.

660
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,508
You know, she ain't never gonna let that go.

661
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,068
I keep telling her, man, we can't show
this legit money yet, man...

662
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,478
especially since he ain't got no insurance.

663
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,914
Soon, though.

664
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:05,285
So, you ain't big on coming here, right?

665
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,913
No.

666
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,854
Tell you something, man...

667
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,087
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?

668
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:14,322
- This is family.
- I know.

669
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,195
Family is what counts,
family is what it's about.

670
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,995
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

671
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,373
Man.

672
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,055
You never figured on this, did you?

673
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,568
Live the life, lead the life. Ain't no big thing.

674
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,965
He used to talk that shit all the time and he
believed it, you know what I'm saying?

675
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:01,236
What's up, baby, talk that shit now.

676
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,383
You know, you're right.
It's kind of hard to be in here right now.

677
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,748
He scare you, don't he?

678
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,722
- You know, I'm just saying...
- He scares me.

679
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,095
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.

680
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,001
Coming up the way we did,
you kind of expect that.

681
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,168
Waiting on it.

682
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,364
See...

683
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:37,278
the thing is, you only got to fuck up once.

684
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:43,249
Be a little slow, be a little late. Just once.

685
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:48,121
And how you ain't gonna never be slow...

686
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,387
never be late?

687
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,997
You can't plan for no shit like this, man.

688
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:56,723
It's life.

689
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,769
Scares me.

690
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:26,326
They're still using it.
I was by on Saturday night and it was gone.

691
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,194
On your own time?

692
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,324
You still getting your boys?

693
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:34,903
Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.

694
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,001
Omar's rolling.

695
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,483
What the hell?

696
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,055
Call for backup?

697
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:57,960
Not yet.

698
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,491
Let's see how it plays out.

699
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,009
An invitation.

700
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,647
Feel a little lonesome for backup.

701
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:23,980
Yeah, me, too.

702
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,021
That's nice.

703
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:29,726
- I'll check the rear.
- I'll watch the boys.

704
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,038
Afternoon, gentlemen.

705
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,476
Saying, if you were gonna use that
you would've been done using it by now.

706
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,408
It's clean.

707
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,606
Got to keep it clean.

708
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:59,187
We having one of our little parlays like this,
got to keep it clean, right?

709
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,383
Omar with no gun on the street?
Must be a first.

710
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,250
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.

711
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:09,230
But being as y'all sitting on my ride so long,
I thought I'd save y'all some time.

712
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,822
Come straight on out.

713
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,227
I ain't taking no charge.
You ain't putting me back in no cage.

714
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,271
We're not here to bury you, Omar.

715
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,773
We're pulling you up 'cause
we got a problem in common.

716
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,775
- Problem?
- Barksdale.

717
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:23,941
- No, he ain't no problem.
- I don't know.

718
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,581
Avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies.
And you being you...

719
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:31,110
Put it that way,
I guess he could be a little problem...

720
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,451
but I just can't really come out
and help you all.

721
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:34,614
You know what I mean?

722
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,352
Snitchin' just rubs me wrong.

723
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,686
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

724
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,261
We respect that.

725
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,357
If you do happen to take a charge though...

726
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,565
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.

727
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,500
You give us a call, we'll sort something out.

728
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,733
Fair enough.

729
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:57,011
You know, I used to work the homes,
back when your brother was up there.

730
00:51:58,314 --> 00:51:59,747
You get a chance...

731
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:02,613
let him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.

732
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,376
Good man.

733
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,151
Lot of enemies.

734
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,384
Saying, you trying to catch up with Bird?

735
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:15,288
Word is he dropped a workin' man.

736
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,466
Wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.

737
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,503
What workin' man, what Bird?

738
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:24,630
Come on, now,
ain't but one working man, now, is there?

739
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,508
And Bird?
I think your snitch can handle that.

740
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:31,076
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

741
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,689
You working late?

742
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,827
A little.

743
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:19,121
Got a minute?

744
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:21,394
Sure, have a seat.

745
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,226
No, this is better said standing up.

746
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,165
You know, I've been 13 years on the shelf.
I ain't bitched.

747
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,268
It was me that put me there.

748
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,306
But I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.

749
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,406
We should've had a tap
on the project pay phones by now.

750
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,777
A wire there will get us the drugs.

751
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,983
Keep pushing,
we'll get a whiff of the money, too.

752
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,355
I know you're serious
about climbing that career ladder...

753
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,325
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go...

754
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:52,888
but for me...

755
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,997
I don't want to go to no dance
unless I can rub some tit.

756
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,629
I appreciate your honesty.

757
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,563
Good night, Lieutenant.

758
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:30,292
So, what you say to make Dee pay out?

759
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,301
I told him to give it up
or I'm taking him out of the count.

760
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,734
- Shit.
- Look.

761
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:36,972
I'll pump niggers when I got to.

762
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,013
- That's him.
- That's who?

763
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,479
One of the ones that robbed us.
That light-skinned boy.

764
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:56,984
That's him?

765
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,227
All right, come on.

766
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,030
I'm the king of this shit.

767
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,226
- So, you want us to wait?
- Yeah.

768
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:07,057
- All right, we on it, man.
- All right.

769
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,676
There goes Scar right there.

770
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,442
Right there in the blue?

771
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,847
- Number 80?
- Yeah, I'm on him.

772
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,729
All right, you got him?

773
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,969
- Find a phone real quick.
- What's wrong?

774
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,333
It looks like my man Dee
got himself an emergency.

775
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,966
What, he been stuck up again?

776
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,919
What's up, what do you need?

777
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:11,258
My people are onto one of Omar's
boys down at Greek's.

778
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,420
Word? All right, sit tight.
I'm gonna take care of it.

779
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,588
All right.

780
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,608
Ain't nobody coming.

781
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,777
Dee said wait.

782
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,735
Dee said wait.

783
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,755
Told you.

784
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,704
- He still in there?
- Yeah, he's playing the games.

785
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,664
All right.
You are sharp, son. What's your name?

786
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,335
- Wallace.
- Wallace, all right.

787
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:04,708
This nigger's gonna
point him out to us, all right?

788
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:23,220
Yeah.

789
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,162
It's done. Nice work, cuz.

790
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,727
All right.
