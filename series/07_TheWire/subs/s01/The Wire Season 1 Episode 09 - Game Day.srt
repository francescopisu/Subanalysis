1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,800
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar.

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,717
Him on the ball, from Dunbar.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,017
He junior college now,
but he going to bigger places...

4
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:26,091
if he can make them grades.

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,421
He our edge, right there.

6
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,994
- Where he going?
- I don't know.

7
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,401
Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.

8
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:45,068
Okay, so we in the mix, too, now.
You know what I'm talking about?

9
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,872
Blow Proposition Joe's mind.
He ain't got nobody balling like this.

10
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,382
He better not have one motherfucker
balling like this.

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,009
I'm tired of losing to
these Eastside bitches every year.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,056
It's been three years running now, man.
Fucking with my morale, for real.

13
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,752
What happened to the faggot?

14
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,330
Omar?

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,562
- That nigger in the winds, man.
- What you mean he in the wind, man?

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,636
This city ain't that big.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,666
You know what that nigger do
when he holed up somewhere?

18
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,969
He peel off one or two packages,
roll around the neighborhood...

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,070
giving away free vials and shit.

20
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,684
Yeah, on some real Robin Hood type shit.
If we try and get at him...

21
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,584
we going to have two dozen niggers
saying that we on our way.

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,624
If you want us to hunt that nigger,
we going to hunt.

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,627
But the smart play, I think, we call a truce...

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,896
put this thing on hold for a hot second.

25
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,732
Let the faggot get comfortable...

26
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,826
and when he do, he'll pop up his head.
Boom, we got him.

27
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,770
What will motherfuckers be saying
while we waiting?

28
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,100
What people going to say...

29
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,406
when they see this
cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine?

30
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,078
Like it ain't no thing to take my shit.

31
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,652
- Kid's everything I said he was?
- Yeah, he is straight.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,456
Don't know what we're going to do
without him next year.

33
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,498
- How come you ain't signed?
- Lot of schools looking at me.

34
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,625
- I'm listening.
- $10,000, though, that ain't bad, right?

35
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,832
- It ain't.
- $10,000 for the kid, plus $5,000...

36
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,608
donation for the program.

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,468
Done.

38
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,372
Good. Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.

39
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,211
Yo, man, good job, baby.

40
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,251
All right, big guy.

41
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:40,320
And I assume there's another $5,000
right here, for making this happen?

42
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,522
Ain't shit for free, right?

43
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,618
So, what you do for money?

44
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,458
Can't live without it, right?

45
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,090
You still fucked up
behind that stickup, man?

46
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,203
Shit ain't on you. It ain't on me neither.

47
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,935
Motherfucker who robbed
the stash shot Sterling.

48
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,101
He gonna get got
no matter what you or me do.

49
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,078
I just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more.

50
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,169
All right?

51
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,182
I was thinking about going
to school, over at Edmondson...

52
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,844
ask if they'll let me back in
at the end of the semester.

53
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,184
- What grade?
- Ninth.

54
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,814
Ninth? Shit, you how old?

55
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,187
Sixteen.

56
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,592
Sixteen. Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.

57
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,791
I heard Stinkum got killed.

58
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,593
Yeah.

59
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,596
Damn.

60
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,508
- I said I don't want to play.
- I heard you.

61
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,550
And you ain't got to do nothing.

62
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,846
I heard you. Take it.

63
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,314
Hurry up, nigger, people looking.

64
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,482
Look here, man,
you a smart little motherfucker.

65
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,918
You start back up at Edmondson...

66
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:33,021
you likely to finish up at Harvard
or some shit like that. Believe, B.

67
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,226
And you got a good heart in there, too.

68
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,732
Not like the rest of these niggers.

69
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,273
- Yeah?
- Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.

70
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,552
Right.

71
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,655
Where the fuck you at, man?
You coming to get this shit or what?

72
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,246
Keep cool, we making rounds.

73
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:02,259
- You know I ain't moving like I used to.
- All right, couple hours, we be at you.

74
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,419
All right.

75
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,565
Wee-Bey picking up at the towers?

76
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,432
- In a couple hours, give or take.
- Time enough for us to make a play.

77
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,132
What's up with Wallace?

78
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,367
Nothing.

79
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,466
Nothing?

80
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,046
Nothing.

81
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,912
It's all good, just leave him be.

82
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,114
Damn.

83
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,249
Fuck.

84
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:37,621
I'm tired of not having a phone
up in this joint.

85
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,425
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,691
- Have a nice hike.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,382
- Hello, you make order?
- Who this?

88
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,510
You make order? Good yakame.

89
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,321
- What?
- Or no delivery.

90
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,688
You make order, you come get.
Good yakame, good noodle.

91
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,224
Extra ketchup.

92
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,263
What the fuck was that?

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,995
That was my Korean counterman.

94
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,761
Sounded Chinese.

95
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,006
Like you can fucking tell the difference.

96
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,409
It's a brave new world for you, boys.

97
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,247
12-14.

98
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,118
- Request a lateral with 12-08.
- Go ahead, 14.

99
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,818
08, can you go to Channel 3?

100
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,789
12-08, I got that.

101
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,259
- Where you at?
- McCullough above Preston.

102
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,995
We're on a good pay phone
that the pit boys are now using.

103
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,503
I'm up on the church. Hang close, boys.

104
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,267
Might have a nicejack-up for you two.

105
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,611
I can't believe these boys
still in business, man.

106
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,846
- Testers, testers coming in five.
- What's the new package, man?

107
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:11,149
Yellow tops. Shit is the bomb.

108
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,120
- Now shit is the bomb.
- Check it.

109
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,922
A man who wants to get high
more than he wants to get clean.

110
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,589
- He was doing good, too.
- Told you, it was bullshit.

111
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,328
- Them meetings were just fronts.
- The man sounded strong, you know?

112
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,130
Whatever.

113
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,029
It's about that time.

114
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,640
- Shit.
- What happened?

115
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,703
That's the boy who beat me down, man.

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,482
The shits right here is
yellow tops and they right...

117
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,485
so remember where you caught this blast
and tell your fiend-ass friends.

118
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,646
Line the fuck up.

119
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,657
Back up.

120
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,784
Get in line, what the fuck? Line the fuck up.

121
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,389
Get the fuck out of here. Damn, fuck you all.

122
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,201
Hurry up. Over here.

123
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,706
Get one, girl, over here. I got one.

124
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,499
You get one?

125
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,271
Hold up. You catch one?

126
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,008
You know, I got three if you need.

127
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,677
You was at the meeting
over at Samuel Morse.

128
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,516
Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that.

129
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,623
Stood up, though.

130
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,056
Why you down at the tester line
if you ain't chasing?

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,151
Trying to get my little nephew
off the corner.

132
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,787
His mama sent him up to Cumberland,
you know?

133
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,492
Try to keep him clean at my grandma's.

134
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,402
He ain't anywhere near his bottom.

135
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,864
Got to see that bottom coming up at him.

136
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,373
Hard, too, 'cause he's young, 24.

137
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,672
Most people don't get tired
till they're 35, 40.

138
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,641
- How old are you?
- Young at heart.

139
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,915
Walon, man.

140
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,478
Bubs.

141
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,897
Give them a long rope.

142
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,491
The farther away from the projects
you pop him, the less risk to the wire.

143
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,626
Hell with the wire.

144
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,263
Excuse me?

145
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,806
Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.

146
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,245
You can come at this a few ways.

147
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,149
First thing is we need the names
of all front companies...

148
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,722
limited partnerships,
LLCs, and all that mess.

149
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,520
- LLCs?
- Limited liability corporations.

150
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,888
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.

151
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:34,762
Look up Orlando's, by address, you
match it, and you see it's owned by who?

152
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,398
It's on Baltimore Street, right?

153
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,508
Got it. D & B enterprises.

154
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,773
Give it to Prez,
who's going to get off his ass...

155
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,907
and walk on over to
the state office buildings on Preston Street.

156
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,383
- Preston Street?
- Corporate charter office.

157
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:55,953
Corporate who?

158
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,117
They have the paperwork
on every corporation and LLC...

159
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,386
licensed to do business in the state.

160
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,552
You look up D & B Enterprises
on the computer.

161
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,857
You're going to get a little reel of microfilm.

162
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,399
Pull the corporate charter papers that way...

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,526
write down every name you see.:

164
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,095
corporate officers, shareholders,
or more importantly...

165
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,904
the resident agent on the filing
who is usually a lawyer.

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,344
While they use front names,
you know, as corporate officers...

167
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,576
they'll usually use the same lawyer
to do the charter filing.

168
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,084
Find that agent's name,
run it through the computer...

169
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,054
find out what other corporations
he's done the filing for...

170
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,522
and that way we find other front companies.

171
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,594
While he's doing that, what do I do?

172
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,128
You're gonna to keep your head
in this assessment book.

173
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,427
Look up any properties
that you can connect to Barksdale.

174
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,024
How do you know
it connects to Barksdale, right?

175
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,628
You work off of what Prez gets you
from the corporate charter documents.

176
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,267
Whatever companies he links to Barksdale
or people connected to him...

177
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,369
you look for those companies
in the city land records.

178
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,710
For example:
McNulty said that he heard that Barksdale...

179
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,945
owned an apartment building
up on Druid Park Lake.

180
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,284
You look up all the blocks on Reservoir Hill.

181
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,018
See if there's anything
owned by D & B Enterprises...

182
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,219
or any other company that Prez finds...

183
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,762
through corporate charter
or anything similar.

184
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,857
If you find something that fits,
you write down the folio number...

185
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,368
so that you can look it up later
at the courthouse.

186
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,869
You don't find anything...

187
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:24,272
just take the names of all the corporate
listings for the multi-units near the lake.

188
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,244
You call that list over to Prez,
who pulls the charter papers...

189
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,282
and he'll look for connections.

190
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,613
- It's like a scavenger hunt.
- But what if Barksdale is careful?

191
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,950
I mean, what if we can't
find his name on anything?

192
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,417
In this country...

193
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,391
somebody's name
has got to be on a piece of paper.

194
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,621
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust...

195
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,493
somebody's name is on a piece of paper.

196
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,259
And here's the rub:

197
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,196
You follow drugs...

198
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,264
you get drug addicts and drug dealers.

199
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,699
But you start to follow the money...

200
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,972
and you don't know where
the fuck it's going to take you.

201
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,845
While we're running around on this,
what are you going to do?

202
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,386
- You need something?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,217
Let me get the...

204
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,417
campaign financial reports
for the western districts...

205
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,619
and actually, any citywide race.

206
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,493
You want quarterly reports
or individual donor lists?

207
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,999
- Both, please.
- It'll be a couple hundred pages.

208
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,600
Really? I'll take all of it.

209
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,445
What the fuck, man?

210
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,879
With your right hand,
reach for the window, open the door.

211
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,956
- Come on, hurry up, man.
- Step out of the car.

212
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,291
Drop the cane, toss the cane.
Come around to the back.

213
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,295
All right.

214
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,091
Turn around.

215
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,669
Sir, is there anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

216
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,863
Nope.

217
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,532
No guns, drugs?

218
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,707
Me ain't got shit.

219
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,250
This money right here,
I didn't just pull this out of your truck?

220
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,587
What money?

221
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,028
Damn, we'll be counting
this limp-dick cash all day.

222
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,259
Where you guys going with all this?

223
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,926
Like the man said, it ain't ours.

224
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,502
It ain't yours?

225
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,971
So, you don't mind if we just
take it off your hands?

226
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,942
Do what you feel. You pretending to take
money out this truck.

227
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,443
I didn't even know it was there.

228
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,741
You know, I know how that shit is.

229
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:46,011
The other day,
I took up the sofa cushions off my couch...

230
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,882
found $1 .40 I didn't even know was there.

231
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,157
You all ain't got no charge, right?

232
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,828
No, fucker, we do not have a charge.
We just got your money.

233
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,299
You want it back, you can explain
it to the state's attorney where you got it.

234
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,773
You all enjoy your day now, you hear?

235
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,676
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed

236
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,447
Give me three.

237
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,710
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed

238
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,481
I'm thinking about the people
I grew up with long dead

239
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,818
The brothers I grew up with, locked up

240
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,789
I'm freestyling off the top of my head

241
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,361
You know, it's swell, Patti LaBelle I like her

242
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,157
But Regina Bell is better

243
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,440
Motherfucker!

244
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,753
Motherfucker, trying to steal our shit.

245
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,660
Motherfucker!

246
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,298
- Fished your wish, Bubbs?
- Yeah.

247
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,243
And you should've seen
the one that got away.

248
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,710
I nearly got killed behind this caper,
you know?

249
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,218
It's all in the game, Bubbs.

250
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah?

251
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,790
This ain't shit.

252
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,594
I'm not high, neither.

253
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,807
It's fucking Arm & Hammer.
We just been firing baking soda.

254
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,238
It's all right, man.
I'll just come up with another plan.

255
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,340
I did it once, right?

256
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,266
Fuck me.

257
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,590
Carv, you go to a restaurant...

258
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,394
and say the waitress gives you
good, decent service.

259
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,757
How much do you tip?

260
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,228
How much do I tip?

261
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,832
- For good service.
- I don't know, 15%.

262
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:04,632
- Some people tip 20%.
- Some people got money.

263
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,976
What you think Wee-Bey would tip?

264
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,107
You'd be a clever motherfucker
if there wasn't a wiretap running.

265
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,909
What do you mean?

266
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,891
Say we turn in $20,000, and this afternoon,
the bosses are listening to the wiretap...

267
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,431
and they hear we took $30,000
out of that car.

268
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,331
Didn't think of that, did you?

269
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,470
We're finding a lot of stuff
on the west side of downtown...

270
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,739
that might be his,
over by that Howard Street corridor.

271
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,838
- What kind of property?
- Low-rent commercials.

272
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,510
A lot of vacants.

273
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,814
The fuck does Avon Barksdale want
with a string of empty storefronts?

274
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,980
- This feels premature.
- What does?

275
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,216
Chasing up assets.

276
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,350
We're not close to putting
a charge to the man.

277
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,554
- That should be the priority.
- We put a charge to Avon Barksdale...

278
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,824
the Deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

279
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:04,561
You want the money side of this case,
it's now or never, Lieutenant.

280
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,003
I'm working here.

281
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,036
Maybe $20,000 or $30,000.

282
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,838
Dollars for donuts.

283
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,913
You should've seen the looks on their faces.

284
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,506
- What did Wee-Bey say?
- "What money?"

285
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,848
The only hassle is
we need to sit here and count this shit.

286
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:26,890
- Do the ECU Submissions.
- And it's all limp-dick, dime-vial money.

287
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,251
Dirty bills right off the corner.

288
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,824
You all got the pit boys on
a fresh pay phone, right?

289
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,898
- Yeah, on McCullough.
- You take pictures?

290
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,457
Good, we're gonna need an additional
affidavit to get up on that phone.

291
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,537
Another 30 days, McNulty?

292
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,703
What the fuck did I do?

293
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,211
One day he fights,
the next day he's ready to roll over.

294
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,976
- Does he want this fucking case or not?
- Give him some slack, Jimmy.

295
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,985
He's wrestling with the angels on this one.

296
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,153
Where's my lucky pen?

297
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:33,883
- You ready, bitch?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

298
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,893
I wanna get on my knees
and suck you like a great big lollipop.

299
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,793
- Yeah, suck it.
- Yeah, I know that's your favorite.

300
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,500
Let me lick that. You like that?

301
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,932
I want you to butt-fuck me.

302
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,731
We're supposed to turn off the tap
when it's non-pertinent.

303
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,707
Fuck, no, this is too good.

304
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,676
- Fuck me.
- Daddy, yeah.

305
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,106
There's no way I'm transcribing this stuff.

306
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,145
Touch yourself.

307
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,311
Yeah.

308
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,588
- My pussy is so wet right now.
- Phone sex?

309
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,618
Shit was hilarious.

310
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,620
You're supposed to shut down
after 90 seconds if it's non-pertinent.

311
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,392
You're gonna to look like
a glazed donut, you know that?

312
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,864
Is that right?

313
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,868
I'm gonna get there and fuck you
in all three holes.

314
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,970
- So, you're gonna come past here?
- Tomorrow, yeah.

315
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,374
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.

316
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,242
- Check in with Wallace.
- Wallace?

317
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,611
He's off the hook since
we helped the tower crew...

318
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,617
get that stickup boy.
I'm telling you, Wallace is bugging.

319
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,187
Don't hardly even come
out of that room no more.

320
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,224
- Why he be like that?
- I think he might be getting high.

321
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,793
- Wallace?
- Boy scaring me with his shit.

322
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,692
- All right, you holler at me later.
- That'll work.

323
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,494
Pertinent now, right?

324
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,761
If you can explain
why we're still on the line...

325
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,336
after 10 minutes jerking off.

326
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,302
You got to justify that.

327
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,933
Maybe three holes was the code
for three stash houses.

328
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,709
Omar.

329
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,183
Omar coming.

330
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,882
- Did you hear me? I said Omar coming.
- Let's get out of here.

331
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,858
I said, Omar coming through.

332
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,832
Somebody in trouble now.
Come on, let's go.

333
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,890
You all need to open this door, man,
before I huff and puff.

334
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,292
Come on, now,
by the hairs of your chinny-chin-chin.

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,095
Omar, you best roll out,
we up in here with a MAC-10.

336
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,363
I thinks not, Terrell, I thinks not.

337
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,973
You all might need to think this through
and stop wasting my time.

338
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,339
Because Omar can come back tomorrow.

339
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,237
And the next day.

340
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,779
And the next day.

341
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,787
And I will put a bullet in all you all behind,
what happen right now, you heard?

342
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,634
Fair enough.

343
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,709
Here you go, keep it.

344
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,784
How do you wanna play it?

345
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,678
Hard and tight, like she's got no choice.

346
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,054
- Shardene Ennis.
- Miss, we need to talk.

347
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,857
- About what?
- It's a downtown talk.

348
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,451
This way. Come on.

349
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,492
Give me a two and two.

350
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,982
- What's up?
- What you got?

351
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,285
Family affair, two-for-one, you up?

352
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,389
- No. Not me.
- All right.

353
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,572
How you figure these little pebbles
get up on top of the roof?

354
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,239
Where's everybody at?

355
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,371
Maybe the whole thing is over
and no one bothered to tell us.

356
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,677
Maybe we won.

357
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,154
Something ain't right.

358
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,251
Come on, let's take a ride.

359
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,097
I like these.

360
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,168
- The toy furniture is great.
- Doll house miniatures.

361
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,867
It's a hobby.

362
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,510
My sister had a dollhouse
when we were young, but...

363
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,739
nothing as nice as these. Can I?

364
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:24,141
Sure, babe.

365
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,316
That's a walnut marble-top vanity.

366
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,952
Renaissance revival, late 19th century.

367
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,353
Do you have a house for them?

368
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,998
No, I just make them and sell them.

369
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,900
That seems kind of sad.

370
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,668
You should have a house for them.

371
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,512
We can use the Lieutenant's office.

372
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,962
- No.
- I ain't asked for nothing.

373
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,968
What's up, Tasha? You got too pretty, girl.

374
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,409
Go inside, Tash.

375
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:40,250
I'm thinking about getting clean.

376
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,914
Again.

377
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,827
I was thinking, you know,
I ain't got no other place to go, maybe...

378
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,426
That's wrong, right?

379
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,164
That ain't right, right? Sorry.

380
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,305
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,668
Wait.

382
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:15,582
Back door only.

383
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,987
There's an old sofa in the basement
and I'll throw you down some blankets.

384
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,299
You try to come up those stairs,
and I'm gonna call the police on you.

385
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,665
I swear I will.

386
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,645
West fucking Baltimore is on vacation.

387
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,255
No crews slinging in the low-rises,
the towers.

388
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,834
What the fuck?

389
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,719
- Who's playing who?
- West against East.

390
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,583
- Baltimore?
- The projects, man.

391
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,052
The bragging rights to the projects.

392
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,594
The projects got a ball team?

393
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,078
How long you been working at Orlando's?

394
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,307
- Four, five months.
- You like it?

395
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,646
- Pays the rent.
- You must see a lot there, I imagine.

396
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,741
What do you mean?

397
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,549
There's a lot of players there.
A lot of game being played.

398
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,954
I know nothing about that,
I just work for tips.

399
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,117
- For tips?
- Tips, drinks.

400
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,685
You know, I'm just a b-girl.
I don't mess with nothing beyond that.

401
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,994
Some of the girls in there,
they're into drugs and whatnot.

402
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,626
And some of them turn tricks
in the rooms upstairs but...

403
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,637
I mostly just stay at the bar.

404
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,634
Miss Ennis, it's rare
when we ask somebody...

405
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,643
to come on downtown with us
and we don't have a charge on them.

406
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,804
We don't tell them
what we're gonna talk about.

407
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:17,608
And they come along without complaining.

408
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,411
- That hardly ever happens.
- Rarely, if ever.

409
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,612
- I figure you got your reasons.
- The crew that runs Orlando's...

410
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,247
they've dropped about a dozen
bodies over the last year.

411
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,883
And they're running the drugs
in every housing project...

412
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,292
west of the Martin Luther King.

413
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,455
I don't know anything about that.
I just work for tips.

414
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,898
But now you do know,
because we're telling you.

415
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,368
You know a girl named Keisha Michaels?

416
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,832
- She dances with me.
- How's she doing?

417
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,703
All right, I guess.

418
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,905
Will you excuse us a moment?

419
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,722
- So, what do you think?
- I think she's a sweetheart.

420
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:07,196
I think if we push her hard, she'll tumble.
You want to show her the pictures?

421
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,593
I want to do better than that.

422
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,183
Come on, man, play defense.

423
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,248
- Let's go!
- "D" up, B.

424
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,652
- Who is he?
- That's Marcus Rivera, right there, man.

425
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,289
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played in ltaly and shit.

426
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,197
Slim. What's up, man?

427
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,828
You got to go all the way
to Europe to get you a ringer?

428
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,839
No, he home now.

429
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,109
But I see you pulling boys
out the junior colleges.

430
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,076
He from Eastside, went to Dunbar.

431
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,545
What's up, playboy?
How come you wearing that suit?

432
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:00,913
It's 85 fucking degrees out here
and you trying to be like Pat Riley.

433
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,883
Look the part, be the part, motherfucker.

434
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,319
You walking around with
a fake fucking clipboard.

435
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,890
You can't even read a playbook.

436
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,118
Be for real. Bunch of bitches.

437
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,404
- Let's go.
- That was nice.

438
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,933
That boy was talking to God, right?

439
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,809
Ain't you all on the clock?

440
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,776
- Ain't you?
- We on break.

441
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,145
Then we on a break, too.
What's up with this game?

442
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,779
Just something we do every year,
you know?

443
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,722
Eastside versus Westside niggers.

444
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,920
Loser got to throw a big-ass party
at Druid Hill next weekend.

445
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,055
- Who's favored?
- Eastside won the last two years.

446
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,425
My boys.

447
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:55,596
Found nude Monday morning, in a Dumpster
off Reisterstown road, above Northern.

448
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,675
Toxicology is positive
for heroin and cocaine.

449
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,015
- In a Dumpster?
- Rolled up in a rug.

450
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,411
She overdosed and whoever
was with her didn't do shit...

451
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,043
but roll her up and throw her away.

452
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,382
Because that's how they do.

453
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,617
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal and oral cavities.

454
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,893
Three different blood types, all secretors.

455
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,819
They fucked her and threw her away.

456
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,957
The only reason we knew who she was,
or what she was about...

457
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,001
or what she might mean
to someone like you...

458
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,434
is because we've been
keeping an eye on the people...

459
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,665
who run Orlando's for some time now.

460
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,799
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying...

461
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:32,898
what they're thinking.

462
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,705
You know what they said about this one?

463
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,543
That the stupid bitch didn't know how good
the snort was at Little Man's party.

464
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,140
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do it.

465
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,550
They use people,
and when they throw them away...

466
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,815
they find a way to say it ain't on them.

467
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,415
Lying motherfucker.
He said they took her to a hospital.

468
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,144
Now, get back on "D."

469
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,145
Check out Avon. He's freaking.

470
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,215
Shit, man, we got to win this one.

471
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,211
I think Avon's here.

472
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,820
- Where?
- Like I know what he looks like?

473
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,187
He's a black guy rooting for Westside.

474
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,330
We might have a visual on Avon.
Street ball game up at Cloverdale.

475
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,374
- Where's Greggs and Freamon?
- Pressing the stripper they picked up.

476
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,510
You and Carver stay on the radio.

477
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,608
- We should follow him.
- Why?

478
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:52,755
He ain't gonna touch drugs or money
anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant.

479
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:57,191
In Narcotics we follow guys.
We do it well, we make cases on it.

480
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,161
Mount up.

481
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:14,569
We been on this guy three months.
Don't you even want to get a look at him?

482
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,671
I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale
if I fell over him in the street.

483
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,010
The thing is, I don't need to.

484
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,676
We get him by voice alone
or we don't get him.

485
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,123
Yeah, baby!

486
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,158
Half-time.

487
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,128
You got yourself a fine ringer.

488
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:37,826
It's not your year,
you know what I'm talking about?

489
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:41,132
- It look that way, but you never know.
- I know, man, we up 12.

490
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,138
Yeah, you is, but...

491
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,600
I got a proposition for you.

492
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,043
- Okay.
- Double down?

493
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,614
Let's give this wager a clean six figures.

494
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,485
You serious?
I don't give a fuck. It's your money.

495
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,953
You can waste it if you want,
you know what I'm talking about?

496
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,523
- Anyone got him?
- 64-Charlie to central K.

497
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:08,620
12-10.

498
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,189
12-10.

499
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,060
12-10.

500
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,965
You have him?

501
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,704
Lieutenant, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

502
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,621
Got him marked.
On the sideline, red shirt, white visor.

503
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,129
I think he's coaching or something.

504
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,061
Who this fucking midget?

505
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,814
Get that midget out of here, B.

506
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,560
- Why you holler at me?
- Man, we getting down to it.

507
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,160
- I get to you when I get to you.
- That's it, we're on the stash.

508
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:57,533
We are?

509
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,511
How can you put that down
when Sydnor wasn't on the roof?

510
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,985
Yes, he was.

511
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,420
No, he's not, he's with Daniels.

512
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,420
No, he isn't.

513
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,504
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Ref, what the fuck?

514
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,256
What the fuck?

515
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,434
Ref, what the fuck?

516
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,769
The boy was fouled. Clear, straight up!

517
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,169
How you going to not call that?

518
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,772
If you want, I can put time
back on the clock and replay it.

519
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,848
You talking about a do-over?
Talking about a fucking do-over?

520
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,577
That's not how the game is played!
You can't do that!

521
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,245
Believe this shit?
Nigger talking about doing it again.

522
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:21,586
- I don't want any trouble, okay?
- Ain't going to be no trouble over no ball.

523
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,651
Man, you supposed to be the ref, right?

524
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,220
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self? You pussy.

525
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,792
You can't let any old motherfucking nigger
get in your face, you understand?

526
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,595
Now, walk away.

527
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,573
Turn around and walk the fuck away.

528
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,903
Ignorant motherfucker.

529
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,243
- We cool?
- Yeah, we cool, baby.

530
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,217
You tell your people to come to the park,
Saturday at noon.

531
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,551
Of course you come
on the Westside again, without a ball...

532
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,783
I'm gonna light your ass up.

533
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,766
- D'Angelo?
- You know him?

534
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,266
At this point, it feels like I do.

535
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,700
We sort of moved in together.

536
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,643
He seemed like he was different.

537
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,351
- I have to quit the club.
- Yes, you do. But not just yet.

538
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,089
We need your help.
Which is why we came to you.

539
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,886
- I don't know what else...
- Keisha was not the first.

540
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,453
Unless somebody steps up a little bit,
she's not going to be the last neither.

541
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,096
You like that one?

542
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,137
Why don't you keep it?

543
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,443
Thank you.

544
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,088
- He's getting into a black Ford Excursion.
- Copy that.

545
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,325
He's pulling out, north on Collington.

546
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,846
He's pulling out, north on Collington.

547
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,534
11-71.

548
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,838
You got the parallel on the north,
I got him on the south.

549
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,906
11-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going east on Oliver.

550
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,097
He just parked. East of Oliver.

551
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,500
12-10, you keep the eyeball.

552
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:51,540
11-71, take up a position on Federal,
west of Montford.

553
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,576
I'm coming up from the south.

554
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,975
11-71, I copy that.

555
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,049
He's just sitting there.

556
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,708
- He's doubling back.
- Copy.

557
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:36,946
He's south on Montford.

558
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,405
He jumped the light at Preston and Milton
and is south on Milton.

559
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,684
Be advised that he didn't make it to Chase.

560
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,353
11-71, what's your status?

561
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,916
He couldn't have gone past us.

562
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,520
11-71, nothing on this side.

563
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,833
Must have went to ground.

564
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,399
All right, hold your positions.
I'll take a look.

565
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,275
- He called again, same pay phone.
- Same voice?

566
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:09,470
It was the main stash house, it's got to be.
The pattern fits.

567
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,071
- Who took the call at the projects?
- Who knows?

568
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,479
There was no one on the roof.

569
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,678
Sydnor was off with Daniels,
chasing Avon in the street.

570
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,513
We had a good day, too.

571
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,853
Kima turned one of the dancers
over at Avon's club.

572
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,223
The one who's fucking D'Angelo.

573
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,495
This guy's good.
We threw everything we had at him.

574
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,932
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.

575
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,899
I'm proud to be chasing this guy.

576
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:10,395
We got four front companies so far,
buying up all kinds of shit.

577
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,305
A club, an apartment building,
a funeral home...

578
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,403
and a lot of real estate on the west side
of downtown by the Howard Street corridor.

579
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,607
Shop fronts and warehouses.

580
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:23,514
- Barksdale's name on it?
- Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some.

581
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,486
Mind if I have a seat?

582
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:31,858
He's had the projects for more than a year
and it's a money factory.

583
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:35,489
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with $22,000.

584
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,693
The boys talking on the wire
were saying it wasn't much of a loss.

585
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,996
$22,000?

586
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,799
That's just from one morning
from the towers and the pit.

587
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,568
Add the avenue corners,
you're probably up near $30,000.

588
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,407
Another take for the evening, $60,000.

589
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,743
- A day?
- That's $25 million a year, conservatively.

590
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,742
You take out 20%
for running expenses and spillage...

591
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,414
and you are still clearing
$1 million a month.

592
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:04,258
- So, where's it all go?
- He shows no flash.

593
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,392
He's got no house, no car in his name...

594
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,557
no jewelry, no clothes.

595
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,465
Just front companies and the property.

596
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:16,597
And political contributions.

597
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,474
$75,000 the last month alone...

598
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,637
all from his front companies
or their listed officers.

599
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,011
And that's just at a quick glance.

600
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,744
I'm just totaling up the legal contributions.

601
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:33,016
You've got the likes of Damien Price,
aide to a state senator...

602
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,115
driving out $20,000 in cash
from the projects...

603
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,126
whenever he feels it.

604
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,423
I know you don't want
to hear this, Lieutenant...

605
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,226
but the money is real and it's everywhere.

606
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:47,200
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

607
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,509
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinking.

608
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,743
All right, I mean, fuck it.
If you want to go, then go!

609
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,443
But you could give me a goddamn reason.

610
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,983
- What do I look like to you?
- What you mean?

611
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,760
- What do I look like to you?
- You look like a girl, a woman...

612
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,265
a beautiful woman, you're fine, what?

613
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,865
I don't look like trash to you?

614
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,634
Baby, this ain't about what you do.

615
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,265
I don't look like something
you could roll up in a rug...

616
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,241
and throw in the trash?

617
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,780
Shardene.

618
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,686
Lieutenant, you paged us?
We were almost home.

619
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,221
Sit.

620
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,741
- Yeah? Checked my count again, yo.
- How bad?

621
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,142
Not too bad, man.

622
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,108
- We got hit about $22,000.
- $22,000? That's all?

623
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,049
All right.

624
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,457
I got towers two, three, five and six...

625
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,762
and another one labeled "P" for the pit.

626
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,498
Where's one and four? It's on the wire
that we took them for $22,000.

627
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,041
You shitheads turned in $15,000.
Where's the rest?

628
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:37,102
- Lieutenant, we ain't got...
- You have till roll call tomorrow...

629
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,240
to crawl back to whatever rock
you hid it under.

630
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,319
It comes back and it goes to ECU.

631
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,919
This doesn't happen.

632
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,625
Not with me. Not with my unit.

633
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,031
I wouldn't steal and not tell you about it.

634
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,530
This some of Avon's shit.

635
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:31,633
You got Avon Barksdale chasing
your ass all around town...

636
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,329
and you still find time to take his shit.

637
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:37,201
- It's your shit now.
- What I want with that?

638
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,537
What anybody want with that, man?

639
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,407
- How much you asking?
- We free.

640
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,613
Free?

641
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:50,043
I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you.

642
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,521
Proposition is,
you get four G-packs for free...

643
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,956
you give me some better idea
on how I can reach Avon.

644
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,794
- How to contact him?
- You all just had a game, right?

645
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,895
- How you get a hold of him to parley?
- We talk now and then.

646
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,625
I page his ass.

647
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:09,162
Okay.

648
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,341
That all you need?

649
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,706
- A number?
- I make do with it.

650
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,211
And a code for one of his peoples.

651
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,208
What Wee-Bey use, 07?

652
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,552
07.

653
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:31,324
What makes you think
I ain't gonna take this off your hands...

654
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,895
and throw your ass up outta here?

655
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:37,296
Come on, man, Avon goes down,
the projects be open market again, right?

656
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,901
Let me understand.

657
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,905
Avon loses $100,000 to me on a bet...

658
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,005
then you bring me some of his shit...

659
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,238
so that I can put
your predatory self on his ass.

660
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,077
Not his day, is it?

661
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,590
Fuck.

662
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,682
Fuck it.

663
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,728
- Where was it?
- The wheel well.

664
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:42,127
You remember when the bag broke?

665
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,029
Think Daniels will believe it?

666
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,068
Would you?

667
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:54,773
You didn't believe me.

668
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,409
I'm sorry.

669
00:51:58,815 --> 00:51:59,873
Savino late, man.

670
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,577
I'm ready to make this money-run,
get the fuck out here.

671
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,348
- You tired?
- I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.

672
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,753
Shit, me too.
Want something to eat from the diner?

673
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:10,348
Yeah, you going over there?
Get me a cheese steak, man.

674
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,758
- You hungry, too?
- Yeah, I could do a burger.

675
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:13,851
All right.

676
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:16,625
- Let me get onions on that, man.
- I got you.

677
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,397
You organizing it right?

678
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:23,939
You got my $50s with my $50s,
and my $100s with my $100s?

679
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,537
All right, ladies, good night.

680
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,442
I see you all tomorrow, on time, you hear?

681
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,733
Count this money, baby.

682
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:05,739
- What the fuck?
- Who's that?

683
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,277
Wee-Bey swinging me an emergency call.

684
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,232
Fuck.

685
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,335
Bey?

686
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,038
911 call.

687
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,785
No. We got rules, right?

688
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,013
Fuck.

689
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,141
They had cheese fries, baby. I got you some.

690
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,367
Avon, stay down, man. I got you covered.
