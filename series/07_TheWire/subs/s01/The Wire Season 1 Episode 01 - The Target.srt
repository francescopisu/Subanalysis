2
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,152
- So, your boy's name is what?
- Snot.

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,295
- You called the guy Snot?
- Snotboogie, yeah.

4
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:33,961
"Snotboogie."

5
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,233
He like the name?

6
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,635
- What?
- Snotboogie.

7
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:45,342
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar lsaiah Betts?

8
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,006
You know, he forgets his jacket...

9
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,485
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole...

10
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,217
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
he calls him "Snot."

11
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,192
So, he's "Snot" forever.

12
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,888
Doesn't seem fair.

13
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,863
Life just be that way, I guess.

14
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,271
So who shot Snot?

15
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,067
I ain't going to no court.

16
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,048
Motherfucker ain't have
to put no cap in him though.

17
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,176
Definitely not.

18
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:28,119
He could've just whipped his ass,
like we always whip his ass.

19
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,213
- I agree with you.
- He gonna kill Snot.

20
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,191
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

21
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,762
Kill a man over some bullshit.

22
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:42,161
I'm saying, every Friday night...

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,137
in the alley behind the cut-rate,
we rolling bones, you know?

24
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,901
All the boys from around the way,
we roll till late.

25
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,499
Alley crap game, right?

26
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:54,678
And like every time,
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

27
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,713
Play it out till the pot's deep.
Then he'd snatch and run.

28
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,348
- Every time?
- Couldn't help hisself.

29
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,090
Let me understand you.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,488
Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

31
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,065
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...

32
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,802
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?

33
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,001
- You let him do that?
- We catch him and beat his ass.

34
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,098
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

35
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,206
I gotta ask you.

36
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,917
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

37
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,386
why'd you even let him in the game?

38
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,681
What?

39
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,451
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

40
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:43,325
Got to. This America, man.

41
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,131
- Guess what he says.
- What?

42
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,102
"Gotta let him play, this America."

43
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,429
No fucking way.

44
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,532
- Would I make it up?
- He give you the shooter?

45
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,804
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried.

46
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,847
It's down, Bunk.
Barksdale's in Part 12, right?

47
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,412
Project murder, Westside.

48
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,711
- Which one, now?
- Never mind.

49
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,420
Gonna sit in on it for a bit.
Where you gonna be?

50
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,491
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

51
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,755
- Don't answer no phones, Bunk.
- Yeah, yeah.

52
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,326
And is that your signature
on that photo array card?

53
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,956
Yes.

54
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,595
And those are your initials as well,
next to the photo you identified?

55
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,002
Yes.

56
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:10,837
Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified
from that photo array card...

57
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,373
sitting in the courtroom today?

58
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,688
He's right there.

59
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,832
For the record, the witness
has identified the defendant...

60
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,524
D'Angelo Barksdale.

61
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,065
- Your witness.
- Thank you.

62
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,968
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

63
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:43,941
Have you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

64
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,808
- No.
- No further questions, your honor.

65
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,751
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

66
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,951
State calls Nakeisha Lyles, Your Honor.

67
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,972
Do you promise to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

68
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,011
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

69
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,272
I do.

70
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:26,249
- Ma'am, can you state your name, please?
- Nakeisha Lyles.

71
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,488
- And are you employed?
- Yes, I am.

72
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,957
- And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
- I'm a security guard.

73
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:38,258
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4, the day of the shooting?

74
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:42,167
- What were your duties on that date?
- I was in the booth of 221.

75
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:48,332
And is that the guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?

76
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,466
Yes.

77
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,511
And you're behind bullet-proof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

78
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,546
- Yeah.
- Good.

79
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,118
Now, Ms. Lyles, I know
this may be difficult for you...

80
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,949
but can you tell us what you saw?

81
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,347
A man, you know,
he was waiting for the elevator...

82
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,419
and when another man
just starts beating on him...

83
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,361
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down...

84
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,729
- The victim got knocked down?
- No, the man with the gun.

85
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,496
The man who was knocked down had a gun.

86
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,974
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

87
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,772
Nope.

88
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,846
Excuse me?

89
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,112
He ain't here.

90
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,557
You don't...

91
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,495
You testified.

92
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,164
Ms. Lyles, do you remember
when Detective Barlow...

93
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,203
showed you this photo array?

94
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,101
- Yeah.
- Good.

95
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,839
I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo...

96
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,173
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

97
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,772
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

98
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,884
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

99
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,054
But you identified him.

100
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,752
That's 'cause
he looked like the boy that did it.

101
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,729
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.

102
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,232
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

103
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,537
Right, a week later.

104
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,673
Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives...

105
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,073
you never said anything about...

106
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,839
I tried. I called Detective...

107
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:41,354
Yeah, Detective Barlow on May 13th at 2:00.

108
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,648
- But he didn't call me back.
- Nicely done.

109
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,919
- You called Detective Barlow?
- Yeah, twice.

110
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,865
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

111
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,994
- I need a price for pressure-treated.
- $14.

112
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,240
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?

113
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:02,172
Do you feel that, Mikey, do you feel it?

114
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,938
'Cause I swear to God
that is my fucking dick in your ear.

115
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,275
- That's nice.
- Hang on, you fucking thief.

116
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,807
What's up?

117
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,884
- You been down the hall lately?
- What?

118
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,380
Your case just hit the wall.
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

119
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,419
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

120
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,688
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

121
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,292
No.

122
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,094
You use my goddamn car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch around.

123
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,169
- Yo, ease up.
- You don't understand.

124
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,104
- I did it for that man and he do this.
- Getting heated ain't gonna help.

125
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:37,439
- Greggs, what's your bird saying?
- It ain't what she says.

126
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,670
Yeah? What do you say?

127
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,340
I say we wait, shithead.

128
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,252
- That's him.
- All right, easy, girl.

129
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,285
- Yo, Herc, you got that?
- Yeah, we see.

130
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,655
- Are the uniforms on the horn?
- They're on hold.

131
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
- That's Ghost.
- All right, good, Tiff.

132
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,256
Now tell me what I'm seeing, girl.

133
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,662
- He gonna get little Mike.
- Then what?

134
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,798
Mike come back with the money.

135
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,906
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

136
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,135
- I don't want no foot chase.
- Copy.

137
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,637
Got it.

138
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,174
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

139
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,714
Get the house on the left.

140
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,551
Get down. Get on the ground.

141
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,025
Get up.

142
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,219
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Get your hands up.

143
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,093
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker around the corner.

144
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,962
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

145
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,196
Drop them now. Get out of the car.

146
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,530
Get down right here, right here.

147
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,842
Passenger, put your hands
out of the car window.

148
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:48,608
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open up the car door.

149
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,807
Slowly. Step out of the car.

150
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,653
Down on the ground.

151
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,892
That's it, take his ass to jail.

152
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,096
- You got him, Carv?
- I got him.

153
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,958
- Look at this shit.
- Cross your legs.

154
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,603
Look at this.

155
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,335
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?

156
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,743
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint.

157
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,476
- Stay in the car.
- Tell him to leave my car be.

158
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,645
- Stay in the fucking car.
- That shit just ain't right.

159
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,949
Whatcha doing with something like that?

160
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,521
What you got here?

161
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,127
You should've seen
the way this bitch was looking at me, Kima.

162
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,097
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

163
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,694
Right?

164
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,146
Two guns, remember?

165
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,150
- Two?
- It's all good, Kima, ease up.

166
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,752
All rise.

167
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,491
Part 12 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.

168
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,929
Be seated.

169
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,736
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

170
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,609
As to the defendant D'Angelo Barksdale...

171
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,803
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

172
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,813
Not guilty.

173
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,484
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

174
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,076
Not guilty.

175
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,451
Yeah.

176
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,490
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Be seated.

177
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,391
It's you, daddy, yeah, that's right.

178
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,024
- At least you made them work for it.
- Be seated.

179
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,201
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

180
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:54,070
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial...

181
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,574
for processing prior to his release.

182
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:08,245
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

183
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,782
- You have a nice day.
- Yo, Stringer, let's go.

184
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,695
Detective?

185
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:28,632
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.

186
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,308
- What the hell happened out there?
- We lost.

187
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,879
Were you on this?

188
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,577
- The case?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,487
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.

190
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,989
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

191
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,418
No reason.

192
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,325
You just like coming to court
on murders you don't even work?

193
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,953
Just for the thrill of it?

194
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,027
When you start coming with the customers...

195
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,898
it's time to get out of the business.

196
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,336
You shouldn't talk dirty
now that you're a judge.

197
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,670
Now that I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

198
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,040
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.

199
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,572
- Who?
- Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

200
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,884
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace for a year.

201
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:14,976
Stringer Bell?

202
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,750
That was him in court
with the legal pad and the glasses...

203
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,849
scaring the living shit out of every witness.

204
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,861
Him and the rest of his crew,
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.

205
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,989
- I saw them.
- You think about clearing the court?

206
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,465
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.

207
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,804
I thought it was Baltimore.

208
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,741
Barksdale has five out of seven towers
in the Terrace.

209
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:41,041
That's 10 stairwells in five high-rises,
going 24/7 for dope and coke.

210
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,545
And that's just the towers.

211
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,482
The low-rises,
the avenue corners, they're all his, too.

212
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,349
How do you know this?

213
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,921
- Everybody knows it.
- Define "everybody".

214
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,615
Everybody on the Westside.

215
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,056
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.

216
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,792
I mean, they've dropped
10 or 12 bodies in as many months.

217
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,027
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing they just did.

218
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,570
- Who's working on them?
- In the department?

219
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,874
Nobody, really.

220
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,845
We're a little busy
doing street rips, you know.

221
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,072
Community policing and all that.

222
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,345
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?

223
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,711
Who said I did?

224
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,921
One more time.

225
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,332
Stop playing...

226
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,961
Fuck me.

227
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,872
You got submission numbers for the ECU?

228
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,535
- Nope.
- Get them.

229
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,339
- Why me?
- You want the collar, do the submissions.

230
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,407
- You giving me the start?
- It's your turn.

231
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,018
What's the extension for ECU?

232
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,413
Do I look like your bitch?

233
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,153
- We taking the Mercedes?
- No, I promised my girl.

234
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,252
Car's in her name.

235
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,929
Narcotics.

236
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,596
- Lieutenant. Line 2.
- Here you go.

237
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,895
- Fuck me, I cannot type.
- Who the fuck can?

238
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,537
Millennium been and gone...

239
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,699
and we still fucking around
with Smith-Corona.

240
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,504
We need to get them computers hooked up.

241
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,476
They promised to train us a year ago.

242
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,707
What would an ass-ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

243
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,718
- I don't know, trade stocks and shit.
- Jerk off, you mean.

244
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,789
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn...

245
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:33,985
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

246
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,085
- Gotta go upstairs.
- What's up?

247
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,398
Deputy's throwing some kinda piss-fit.

248
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,430
- Major know?
- He's up there now.

249
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,404
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

250
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,936
Like our major don't know
what that tastes like?

251
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,169
It's the chain-of-command, baby,
the shit always rolls downhill.

252
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:55,311
- Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
- Piss does too, think about it.

253
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:59,078
- Shit rolls, piss trickles.
- Downhill, though.

254
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,426
You don't know that for sure...

255
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,988
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers...

256
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,324
but why are there only two ECU numbers?

257
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,417
- Dope and guns.
- Two guns, right?

258
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,895
- That's three.
- Fuck it, Kima.

259
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,899
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it your own self.

260
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,471
He means
that we are an effective deterrent...

261
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,632
on the war on drugs
when we are on the street.

262
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,337
- Fucking motherfuckers up, right?
- Indeed.

263
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,844
Fuck the paperwork.

264
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,609
- Collect bodies, split heads.
- Split them wide.

265
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,047
- The Western District way.
- All right.

266
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,616
You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

267
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,352
Fighting the war on drugs...

268
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,821
one brutality case at a time.

269
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,785
Girl, you can't even call this shit a war.

270
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,157
Why not?

271
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,125
Wars end.

272
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,168
You gonna write that down?

273
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:02,077
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

274
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,580
Smoke 'em if you got 'em...

275
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,878
because this motherfucker
is as ripe as they get.

276
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:09,183
- We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
- I know.

277
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,154
But you had to answer the fucking phone.

278
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,125
- Got to pay down my credit cards.
- Not off him, you ain't.

279
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,793
I leave you alone for a minute,
what do you do?

280
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,798
- All right, I heard you.
- Say the words, Bunk.

281
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,291
- Come on, man.
- Speak to me.

282
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,498
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

283
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,302
All right, then, this is my case. My file.

284
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,041
This shit comes back a murder...

285
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,841
you ain't gotta do shit
but stand there and laugh at me.

286
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,210
You happy now, you bitch?

287
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,649
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

288
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,653
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

289
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:45,486
This motherfucker probably came in here
to take a shit and just fell out.

290
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,059
I bet there ain't nothing to it.

291
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,923
- You hope.
- Where you going?

292
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,991
Back to the office, where I belong.

293
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,665
You moldering motherfucker.

294
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,900
Don't even think
about coming back a murder.

295
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,771
Don't even think of that shit.

296
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,874
By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me.

297
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,560
- Major's pissed.
- He should be.

298
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,460
He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

299
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,499
- About what?
- Avon Barksdale.

300
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,558
Who?

301
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,001
- That's what I said.
- Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?

302
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,801
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan...

303
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,402
a Westside player who apparently indulges
in the occasional murder.

304
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,240
Now, as of today,
I never heard of Mr. Barksdale...

305
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,678
but by tomorrow...

306
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,016
All right, what do we know?

307
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,888
According to the judge,
he has the Westside high-rises.

308
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,256
The Terrace, mostly.

309
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,359
- Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
- Maybe so.

310
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,671
- It's gotta be tonight?
- Major wants it filed by morning.

311
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,938
Call Andrews at DEA. See
what they have on this mope.

312
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,378
What about Homicide?
If the guy's doing murders...

313
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,178
Homicide major was in the same meeting.

314
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,277
His people will be scrambling
to get something on paper, too.

315
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,421
I doubt they'll be willing to share,
but you can try.

316
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,096
Barksdale, Avon.

317
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,494
Got a DOB?

318
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:49,006
- Jay.
- Where the fuck you been all day?

319
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,185
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

320
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,187
Okay. Just so you have an excuse.

321
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,424
But your fuck of a partner
picked up the phone, caught a call.

322
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,290
- Yeah, I saw him out there.
- Yeah, what'd he get?

323
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,126
- Decomp in a vacant apartment.
- Fuck.

324
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,995
Nolan's squad was up,
that one should be theirs.

325
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,434
It's a decomp.
Maybe it comes back a natural death.

326
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:14,564
- You think?
- In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.

327
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,641
Hold up.

328
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,801
Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

329
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:21,108
- What about?
- Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

330
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,915
Sit the fuck down, Detective.

331
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,392
Something wrong?

332
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,021
Put your ass in the chair.

333
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,539
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.

334
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,879
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

335
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,117
Major, what...

336
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,953
Don't "Major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.

337
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,250
What the fuck you doing
over at the courthouse anyway?

338
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,955
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

339
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,230
These are for you, McNulty.

340
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,737
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking lrish ass.

341
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,399
And this bad boy over here
is in your fucking eye.

342
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,206
I'm upstairs answering questions
about some project nigger I never heard of...

343
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,678
who's supposedly beat
my unit out of 10 murders.

344
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,307
Three. They only beat three in court.

345
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,249
I got the deputy asking about 10.

346
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,481
No, they did 10,
we only charged them with three.

347
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,353
- You're full of shit.
- Sir, you can check the files.

348
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:44,321
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

349
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,193
The girl they found
in the stairwell in Saratoga...

350
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,767
Collette something or other.

351
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:50,894
I mean, Major, these guys are real.

352
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:55,236
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

353
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,873
Scroggins? I don't have an H-file
on Scroggins.

354
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,310
He was last year, summer.

355
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:04,008
Two in the back of the head,
low-rise courtyard.

356
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,917
Let me understand something.

357
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:12,185
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

358
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,450
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

359
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,088
Major, look, I'm really sorry.

360
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,298
Phelan, he and I,
we go back a little, you know?

361
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,633
He wanted to know what I know
about the crew in his court.

362
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,535
I had to go upstairs knowing nothing...

363
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,734
and explain to the deputy why
he's getting calls about murders...

364
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,334
that don't mean a shit to anybody.

365
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,437
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

366
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:38,446
He asks me a question and I answer it.

367
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,815
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

368
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,623
You have my attention, Detective.

369
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,195
My complete, undivided attention.

370
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,060
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going?

371
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,339
- I'm 8:00-to-4:00.
- No.

372
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,899
- You're typing.
- Sir?

373
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,104
Deputy wants a report
on his desk at 0800.

374
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,774
- A report?
- Clean, no typos.

375
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,683
Make it look right, then put my name on it.

376
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,284
Do you want to reference all the murders?
Or should I soft-pedal that?

377
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,621
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?

378
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,455
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.

379
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,130
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

380
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,829
- Deputy likes dots.
- I'm sorry, Major, really.

381
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,316
Niggers crazy in there, yo.

382
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,411
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.

383
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:53,684
- You ain't got no problem, right?
- Hell no, we deep in there.

384
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,289
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.

385
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,492
Sitting there, I didn't know
what the fuck would happen.

386
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,590
I'm wondering...

387
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,034
how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

388
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,703
Slick what y'all did
with that security lady though.

389
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,002
That shit was tight, yo.

390
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,711
Let's walk.

391
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,867
- What's the rule?
- I know the rule.

392
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,135
Say it.

393
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,896
Don't talk in the car.

394
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,367
Or on the phone
or in any place that ain't ours.

395
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:47,241
Don't say shit to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

396
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,110
It's your fucking truck.

397
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,751
Don't talk in the car.

398
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,882
What about Marcel?

399
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,188
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

400
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,626
- You want him out?
- I really don't give a shit what you do.

401
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,060
Actually, no.

402
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,456
Go down there and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

403
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,230
The bum.

404
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,111
- How you doing?
- What's up, Dee, good to see you.

405
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,908
What up, man?

406
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:03,381
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

407
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,753
- Which one?
- White detective, black hair.

408
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:10,259
- The one that was knocking on all the doors.
- What about him?

409
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,362
He showed up in court to watch.

410
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,927
Word?

411
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,763
What are you talking
to that motherfucker for?

412
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:19,963
Damn, Dee.

413
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,368
He say anything?

414
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,670
No, just sat in the back.

415
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:37,114
- Yo, what up, money?
- What you got?

416
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,987
Come on, I got something for you.

417
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,365
- You must feel good.
- You know how that go.

418
00:27:56,743 --> 00:28:00,144
- Say what?
- I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

419
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,077
I don't know shit about jail.

420
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,615
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?

421
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:08,050
You wanna talk about jail though,
you can go sit down next to Marcel.

422
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,884
- He just got home.
- True, you right.

423
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:12,985
Sit your ass down.

424
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,629
I know it ain't go so good.

425
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,201
But that nigger, Pooh,
he caught me off guard.

426
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,499
- He came at me like he was crazy.
- So you shoot the motherfucker?

427
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:28,369
I'm saying, it was him or me.

428
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,002
You in our building.

429
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,268
You got people on both stairs.

430
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,903
You got more motherfucking people
out in the court.

431
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:40,613
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

432
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,779
how the fuck you end up
shooting this nigger...

433
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,323
in front of the security booth
with all them people?

434
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,359
I'm saying, this nigger was coming at me...

435
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,985
- like he was trying to end me.
- This ain't about him.

436
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,763
It's about you.

437
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:56,323
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating neither.

438
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,803
So, the first thing you do,
you get all emotional...

439
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,664
you pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

440
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,069
that now we got to work around.

441
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,600
I know.

442
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,051
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

443
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:19,823
You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

444
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,156
You be saying that
all the time and you right.

445
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,296
But I'm saying though, I mean...

446
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,194
the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.

447
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:32,167
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.

448
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:35,698
I ain't never seen
a white woman turn so red.

449
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,967
You should've been there.

450
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:41,238
Yo, man, you family, okay?

451
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:46,346
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

452
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:48,852
You gonna make that right?

453
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,716
Most def, you gonna see.

454
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,759
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

455
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,426
All right.

456
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,231
Come here.

457
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,435
Don't walk out of here like that.

458
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,338
- You family, all right?
- All right.

459
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,809
- You know it's always love.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:33,929
Type quieter.

461
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,466
You didn't have to wait up, love.

462
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,662
Your boy have a heart attack?

463
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,070
No, I went that way...

464
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,369
but Doc Frazier didn't bite
when this popped up.

465
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:48,607
- You seriously fucked.
- Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

466
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,011
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.

467
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,117
Really.

468
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,451
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.

469
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:00,583
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.

470
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,925
He raise a stink?

471
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:07,529
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops
and I gotta have a report by morning.

472
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:12,130
There you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

473
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,777
Look at them, Cole.

474
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,409
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room...

475
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,216
with two noble, selfless public servants?

476
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,688
I know I'm proud.

477
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,522
Tell me you put this one down.

478
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:37,959
Of course not.

479
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:41,158
Of course your partner here
has to go over to the courthouse...

480
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,565
and lay our business out in front of a judge.

481
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,931
So, you heard?

482
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,505
Major calls me at home,
says I should get in early...

483
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,541
read over your shoulder.

484
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,711
It's got dots.

485
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,613
Deputy loves dots.

486
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,439
Fuck you and your dots.

487
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:01,249
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

488
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,653
And the Deputy's the fucking Deputy.

489
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,054
And he, not the judge...

490
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,252
has what's left of your beshitted career
in his hot little hands.

491
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,488
He says so...

492
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,429
you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.

493
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:17,901
- Fuck it, I came from Western.
- Where don't you want to go, asshole?

494
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,666
Evidence Control? Personnel?

495
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:25,102
- Headquarter Security?
- The boat.

496
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,841
The marine unit?

497
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,074
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me feel seasick.

498
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,183
That's good, keep it up.

499
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:36,911
I'll go this against $10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

500
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,859
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

501
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,072
Yo, Stringer.

502
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,011
- You here early.
- Yeah, I'm on my game today.

503
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,949
Eggy put out testers?

504
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,479
New deal today.

505
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:15,452
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.

506
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,359
- What?
- You the man in the low-rises.

507
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,889
The low-rises?
You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.

508
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,629
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.

509
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,470
Why you gonna put me in the low-rises
when I had a tower since summer?

510
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,133
Yeah, you had a tower.

511
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:36,443
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

512
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,348
This is fucked up.

513
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:42,817
You show us you can run the Pit,
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

514
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,890
My uncle know about this?

515
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,427
What do you think?

516
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,656
- Yo, Bey.
- Yo.

517
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,968
Give little cousin here a ride down the way.

518
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,515
- Have your people deal with Daniels.
- Right.

519
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,503
You gonna send your man McNulty?

520
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,438
Tell him about chain-of-command.

521
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,945
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

522
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:19,375
- Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
- I know.

523
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,482
You Dee, right?

524
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,892
- Wasn't you in the towers?
- Yeah.

525
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,423
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

526
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,561
I killed a nigger.

527
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:45,069
Last call on green top, last call.

528
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,070
Major?

529
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,714
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

530
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,188
Lieutenant, in my hand,
I'm holding how many pages?

531
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,553
- Four, sir.
- Rawls had a fucking phone book.

532
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,888
What can I tell you,
they got 10 open murder files.

533
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,827
If we had 10 shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

534
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,919
I said that upstairs.

535
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,158
They can't put this guy down for a murder...

536
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,998
- so they're getting us to do their work.
- Not getting us, they got us.

537
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:13,628
They got you, in fact.

538
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,897
Excuse me, sir?

539
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,475
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.

540
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,311
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide...

541
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,313
and whoever else
you want from your squads.

542
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,145
- State's Attorney?
- Yeah, we should call them, too.

543
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:30,186
Fucking shitstorm.

544
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,420
Lieutenant, line 3.

545
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,087
Deputy Ops.

546
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:47,762
Here we go.

547
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,902
Close that for me.

548
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,304
What's the coffee do?

549
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,811
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

550
00:36:58,918 --> 00:36:59,907
Yeah.

551
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,283
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

552
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,713
All right, give me the real.

553
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:12,056
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

554
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:14,655
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here.

555
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,993
Feel me?

556
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:18,995
I'm down.

557
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,407
You down? Johnny's down.

558
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,585
- You got that gig.
- Can I get a one-on-one?

559
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,520
Yo, Poot.

560
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:53,565
Yo, Wallace.

561
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,437
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?

562
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,844
- Yeah.
- Man, this is fucked up.

563
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,583
Look, you can't serve
your customers straight up...

564
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,084
after taking they money.

565
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,051
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

566
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,681
See what I'm saying? You get paid...

567
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,624
you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

568
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,663
Then you serve. All right?

569
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,059
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more shortcuts.

570
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,337
- What's your count?
- I'm up $270.

571
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,873
You want to count it.

572
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,238
I mean, I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

573
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:38,145
- But down here, you want to count it.
- Shit.

574
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:45,617
Y'all niggers been burnt.

575
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,324
That's what you got to say?

576
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,997
This look like money, motherfucker?

577
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:56,429
Money be green. Money feel like money.

578
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,138
- That shit look green to you?
- It got a dead fucking president on it.

579
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,569
I don't give a fuck about the president.

580
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,040
- That shit ain't money.
- He ain't no president.

581
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:08,242
- What you mean?
- Hamilton.

582
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,645
- He ain't no president.
- Nigger, is you crazy?

583
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:13,351
Ain't no ugly-ass white man
get his face on no legal...

584
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,613
motherfucking tender except he president.

585
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,750
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?

586
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,056
You ain't even gonna be serving no more.

587
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:24,391
Your ass be out
on the bottom end of Vine street...

588
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,930
sucking on a 40, yelling "5-0".
You hear me?

589
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,391
Get the fuck out of here.

590
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,196
That it?

591
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,841
No.

592
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,925
You need to pace that shit, man.

593
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:06,538
- Johnny, man, you hear me?
- I'm cool.

594
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,234
No, man, you gonna fall out...

595
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:12,003
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

596
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,640
Yo, man, I'm trying
to give you a little game, man...

597
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,277
but you want to pretend
like you know something.

598
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:26,924
I know a lot, Bubbs.

599
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:29,251
No, you green.

600
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,587
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

601
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,255
but you still green.

602
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,331
You gonna make me brown?

603
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,334
Yo, Bubbs?

604
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,072
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

605
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,873
Come on, man, I'm ready.

606
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,918
Yo, I'm brown.

607
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,385
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.

608
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:29,479
- Buy-busts.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:33,554
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.

610
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:36,458
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

611
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,153
That makes sense.

612
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:42,222
Phelan isn't just a judge,
he's a political entity.

613
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:46,129
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

614
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,604
Why is he asking about this Barksdale?

615
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,738
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

616
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,939
- Lost a murder case.
- We lose cases all the time.

617
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,950
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

618
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,177
- Who you using?
- Lead detective?

619
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,289
- Greggs, she's my best right now.
- I know her?

620
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,784
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.

621
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:14,421
- Who's Homicide sending?
- That's up to Major Rawls.

622
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,601
I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty.

623
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,429
- You know McNulty?
- Not really.

624
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,507
He's the one who mouthed off
to the judge in the first place.

625
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:26,669
- He talked to the judge?
- Yeah, that's my understanding.

626
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,005
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

627
00:42:30,182 --> 00:42:32,241
You need anything, you ask me.

628
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,318
I'll give you all the help I can.

629
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,910
- But no surprises.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:39,556
Keep me briefed.

631
00:42:57,276 --> 00:43:00,871
- Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
- Is anyone expecting you?

632
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,709
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad 5.

633
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:06,777
He's expecting me, can I...

634
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,048
- Not without an escort.
- All right.

635
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:13,248
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.

636
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:29,837
- Fitz.
- Brother.

637
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,273
- She can spot a bad one.
- Nothing personal, Jimmy.

638
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,277
You know how they are
with security nowadays.

639
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:37,177
I know how they are with locals, yeah.
So, what's up, g-man?

640
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,079
- Good stuff.
- Yeah?

641
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,981
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

642
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:43,178
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

643
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,313
He's one of the better Cl's I've ever worked.

644
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,188
- You up on a wire?
- That and more.

645
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,023
So, like, he be talking like
he got some type of record deal, you know?

646
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:57,224
- Man, please.
- That nigger.

647
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:01,972
- The pussy has you.
- Jesus Christ.

648
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:05,009
- Pretty fucking great, huh?
- How'd you get this on tape?

649
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:07,939
That's not tape. That's live, brother.

650
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:10,912
That's live?

651
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,042
Live from a three-story walkup
on Homer Avenue...

652
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:15,881
in the bottoms of Pimlico.

653
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,352
This is going on right now?

654
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:19,924
- As we speak.
- How?

655
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:23,323
Fiber-optic lensing.
Camera's behind a hole in the drywall.

656
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,760
So small it looks like
a nail might've made it.

657
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,530
Where's the mic?
These motherfuckers sound great.

658
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,101
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

659
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,169
That's about $3,000 of raw
on the table today.

660
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,035
We followed it all the way from New York.

661
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:37,540
You're up in New York on this?

662
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:38,870
We could be.

663
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:41,876
We're backing into
some Dominicans up there.

664
00:44:42,214 --> 00:44:45,010
We could have a Title III on
them right now if we wanted.

665
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,810
Wrong war, brother.

666
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,747
Most of the squad's been transferred
to counterterrorism.

667
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,119
This thing's the last drug case
we got pending...

668
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,351
and I gotta shut it down
by the end of the month.

669
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,087
- You guys are getting out of drugs?
- Yeah, for a while.

670
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,720
We just don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

671
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,822
Not since those towers fell.

672
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,800
What, we don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

673
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:09,005
- Joke's on us, huh?
- I guess so.

674
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:13,235
Still and all, you give great case, brother.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

675
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:31,890
Got some Tech Nine over here,
over here, Tech Nine.

676
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:42,039
That's it, here's $20, hook it up.

677
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:44,999
Two and two.

678
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,543
- Hold up.
- What?

679
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:49,876
- Just two and two.
- Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

680
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,812
- I gave you $20, man.
- You gave me $20?

681
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:52,884
One and a short three.

682
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,077
- So you get, two...
- $7.

683
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:57,212
- Hold up.
- I get $7 back. Come on, man.

684
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,988
Calm down.

685
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,817
Hold up, hold up, you fucking me up.
Chill out.

686
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,127
You dropping shit on the ground?

687
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,427
- Hold up.
- I ain't got all day.

688
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,037
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.

689
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:18,166
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

690
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,868
That's the motherfucker right there.

691
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,445
- Who?
- The white boy right there.

692
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,275
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

693
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,580
The white boy.

694
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,850
Hold up, man.

695
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,792
Stop that white motherfucker.

696
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:44,259
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger. Fuck that.

697
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,631
What are you doing, man?

698
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,468
Calm down, man.

699
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:49,699
Making me run,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

700
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:52,641
- What, man, why you fucking with me?
- Shit.

701
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:55,542
This the motherfucker right here
with the make-believe money.

702
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,114
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

703
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:00,343
- Wasn't me.
- Motherfucker.

704
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:03,977
It was this nigger, I saw him.
Get the fuck up.

705
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,053
All right, listen, I'm sorry.

706
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:08,548
Fuck that.

707
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,185
What we need to do is,
motherfucker burned us for $30.

708
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,854
We need to take him to Franklin Ave...

709
00:47:12,964 --> 00:47:15,762
and throw his ass right
onto the motherfucking expressway.

710
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,665
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

711
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:23,605
- What you got on you?
- Just the $10 I dropped, man, the real one.

712
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:42,225
What's up?

713
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,237
Fuck it.

714
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,169
Hell, yeah.

715
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:08,047
For now, we'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.

716
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:11,247
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse and your people.

717
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:12,323
Fine with us.

718
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:15,257
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders...

719
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,952
see if anything can be manufactured.

720
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:20,088
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.

721
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,529
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

722
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:24,625
We put years over top of
some of these people, we'll roll a few.

723
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,170
You're not gonna get
Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell...

724
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,706
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.

725
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,969
- You don't know that.
- These guys are good.

726
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:35,240
They're deep and organized.
They've got everyone running scared.

727
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,541
What do you suggest?

728
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,748
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.

729
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,944
Keep gathering string
till we can find a way in.

730
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:45,318
Either a wired CI or a Title Ill.
That's what makes this case.

731
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,220
Is that what you told the judge?

732
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:51,293
Okay, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

733
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,789
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

734
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,367
Then you don't do it at all.

735
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:02,502
Seems to me you all could've had this fight
before calling the State's Attorney's office.

736
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:06,466
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?

737
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,242
What do we know?

738
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:11,773
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.

739
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,745
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?

740
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,386
A B of I photo?

741
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,924
We don't even have
a fucking photo of the guy.

742
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:21,219
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

743
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,092
Two days ago no one on this fucking floor
knew this mope's name.

744
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:27,164
Now he's some kinda criminal mastermind.

745
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,723
Shit, I say we go down to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.

746
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:35,429
You all don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

747
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,838
When you know how
you're playing this, give a yell.

748
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,534
We know how we're playing it.

749
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,110
My people are going down
to do some hand-to-hands.

750
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:46,377
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are
going to the hall to review old murder files...

751
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,748
and try to manufacture a fresh prosecution.

752
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:51,981
As things heat up, I'll go to the deputy
and get us more manpower...

753
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,819
but this case is not going to sprawl.

754
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,860
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.

755
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,221
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.

756
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,788
Anything on the murders, you can take
to llene Nathan in violent crimes.

757
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,368
I'll clue her in.

758
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,873
Anything else?

759
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,202
One last thing:

760
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:18,112
No one does anything at all on the street
without me knowing about it first.

761
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,315
Chain-of-command, Detective.

762
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,417
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

763
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,964
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

764
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,430
Not that simple, Bunk.

765
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,263
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

766
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,803
You know, move it around...

767
00:50:41,973 --> 00:50:45,067
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches with me.

768
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,644
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex...

769
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:49,236
I still lose.

770
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:52,947
- You two can't talk this through?
- No.

771
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,479
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

772
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,723
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

773
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,555
- What about him?
- He's running this detail.

774
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:08,632
- Watch your ass then.
- He a snake?

775
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,201
No, he ain't that. But he's a company man.

776
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:14,299
You know, a prospect.

777
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,500
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

778
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,199
Shortlist for major?

779
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:23,003
He's black, he's still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

780
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:26,344
- Shit, he even has a law degree.
- No shit.

781
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:30,854
- University of Baltimore, but still, you know.
- He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.

782
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:33,688
- How's that?
- Buy-bust?

783
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,925
- He's pissing in the wind.
- You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

784
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:39,988
You made it happen.

785
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:45,430
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.

786
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:49,200
- What the fuck did I do?
- The bridge of what?

787
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,270
You ain't seen that movie?

788
00:51:52,644 --> 00:51:54,339
I am fucked.

789
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,815
Fucked is me.

790
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,850
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

791
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,688
Two more.

792
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,996
- It's all in the game.
- I'm saying it was only a couple dollars.

793
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:23,665
- It ain't the money.
- But we fucked him up so bad.

794
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,669
It's the message, Dee.

795
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,109
You can't show no weakness.

796
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:32,346
- Still, I'm saying.
- What?

797
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,486
String.

798
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:09,917
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

799
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:14,185
- I ain't no john.
- Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

800
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,251
I'm not a regular, okay?

801
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,956
- I work for Stringer.
- He pay you, don't he?

802
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,761
Come on, buy me a drink.

803
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,905
- How much?
- $20.

804
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:31,905
I drink slow.

805
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,346
Maybe another time.

806
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:56,595
- Buy me a drink, honey?
- How about you buy me a drink?

807
00:53:59,938 --> 00:54:02,099
Carla. One here.

808
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,956
- Where you at?
- Where you think?

809
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,638
- You late for work?
- A little.

810
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:40,842
- How much you got left?
- Girl, please.

811
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:45,609
- Ten pages and all the footnotes.
- When's it due?

812
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,109
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

813
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,085
Long night for you.

814
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,586
Long night for me.

815
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,761
I'll make sure and pick up some coffee.

816
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:19,946
So, I drive all the way down
to Liberty Road...

817
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:23,214
at 2:00 in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift...

818
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:26,415
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

819
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:29,286
To get a goddamn mouse
out of my wife's bedroom closet.

820
00:55:29,394 --> 00:55:30,884
Can you imagine that shit?

821
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,196
So what did you do?

822
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,821
What the fuck you think?

823
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,959
I got the mouse out as fast as I could
and drove back to work.

824
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,662
Couldn't do nothing else.

825
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,373
Nadine out of her fucking mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

826
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,410
She's up on the chair and shit
when I come...

827
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,377
like some goddamn cartoon.

828
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:53,447
- I mean, how'd you catch the mouse?
- Catch him? I lit his ass up.

829
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:58,188
You shot the mouse?

830
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,257
With your nine?

831
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,683
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

832
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:05,020
Got him with the second.

833
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:13,563
What?

834
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:17,300
You shot a mouse
with your service weapon?

835
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:18,466
Yeah.

836
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,339
What'd you do with the carcass?

837
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:23,277
I cleaned it up, you know.

838
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,939
I thought about leaving
that little motherfucker there...

839
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,881
as a warning to the others.

840
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,991
Fuck me.

841
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,292
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

842
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:49,603
Jimmy, man,
I gotta change my clothes at least, come on.

843
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,800
I'm gonna do this case.

844
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:56,208
What?

845
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:59,750
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

846
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:02,648
It's a buy-bust, Jimmy, get in and get out.

847
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,685
- Fuck that.
- Jimmy.

848
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:16,594
Let's call it a night.

849
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:41,886
Hi, Bubbs.

850
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,058
Thought you was still locked up.

851
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,458
Nope.

852
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,396
How long you been home?

853
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,405
It's been three months.

854
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:58,966
You don't write, you don't call.

855
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:03,546
Who's he?

856
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:06,644
A friend.

857
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:11,014
Is he gonna make it?

858
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,157
You still working drugs?

859
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,827
Downtown, yeah.

860
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:28,635
I got something for you.

861
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:43,248
- Last call.
- Fuck.

862
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:47,482
Found body. 200, Block Amity.

863
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,650
I'm a little thin today, boss.

864
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,857
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?

865
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:58,228
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.

866
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,838
Yeah.

867
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,301
I got it.

868
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,015
Jesus.

869
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,196
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Bunk, what's going on, man?

870
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,833
We got one or two shots to the head.

871
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:43,007
No witnesses, no suspects.

872
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,015
You got a .380 casing on the ground there.

873
00:59:46,117 --> 00:59:48,210
Buddy, do me a favor, bag that for me?

874
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:51,614
So, who called it in?

875
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:53,821
No one. 21 Post found him.

876
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:58,394
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old...

877
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,629
address on Schroeder.

878
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,961
- You got pictures?
- Yeah, we got them.

879
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,694
Okay, let's roll him.

880
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,670
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified...

881
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,677
sitting in the courtroom today?

882
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,080
He's right there.
