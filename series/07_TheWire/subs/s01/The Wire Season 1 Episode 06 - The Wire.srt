2
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,789
Rise and shine! Come on, man, get up!

3
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,888
Oh, boy. Come on, get up!
School day. Y'all gonna be late!

4
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,959
Let's go. Get up for school.

5
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,501
Go! Get up. Come on, man.

6
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,603
- Damn, Wallace.
- "Damn, Wallace," nothing!

7
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,196
Y'all know what happens
if you don't go to school?

8
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,868
Soon enough, they're gonna be callin'
and all y'all gonna end up in foster care.

9
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:53,276
If y'all want foster care,
climb your little black asses back into bed.

10
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,248
Get outta my way, man.
Damn, it's too early for this shit.

11
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,641
- Narcos?
- No, rollies.

12
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,709
Yo, where's breakfast at?

13
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,011
Here, man. You get two.

14
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,851
- I want two bags.
- You don't get two.

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Come on, getting greedy. Take the chips!

16
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,555
Come on. Take your juice.

17
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,734
Come on, man.

18
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,500
Where's mine?

19
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,605
Go show your teacher. Come on, man.

20
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,381
- Where's your book bag?
- Teacher ain't giving no homework.

21
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,035
That's the worst case of suicide
I've ever seen.

22
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,344
That's him.

23
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,016
You see?

24
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,354
That's him, right there.

25
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,249
That's Omar's boy.

26
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:38,500
- What the fuck can I tell him?
- Whatever the man wants to hear, Jimmy.

27
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,608
Prodigal son.

28
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,672
Major, we got a good shot
at clearing a couple of cases here.

29
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,876
- One...
- We're not here to talk cases.

30
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,782
I don't care about your cases. Sit.

31
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,415
Relax.

32
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,549
I'm a reasonable guy.

33
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,060
In fact, everywhere I go, people say to me:

34
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:05,326
"Bill Rawls, you are a
reasonable fucking guy."

35
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,924
- Am I right, Jay?
- You are reasonable, sir.

36
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,798
Yes. Yes, I am.

37
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,071
And because your sergeant knows me
to be reasonable...

38
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,302
he came in here a couple weeks ago
and reasoned with me. Right, Jay?

39
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,275
We reasoned. We did.

40
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,145
We reasoned that
despite his negligible lrish ancestry...

41
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,982
and a propensity to talk out of turn,
Jimmy McNulty is a good worker.

42
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,555
Probably worth saving.

43
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,387
- Major, I'm not...
- He's a good-looking kid, huh?

44
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,590
Do you know what we do here, McNulty?

45
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,093
What we do here?

46
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,827
That was one of them... What is it?
A question you don't have to...

47
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,133
A rhetorical question.

48
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,801
You were being rhetorical.
Rhetorical and reasonable, sir.

49
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:54,210
We work murder cases here,
as they come in, one at a fucking time.

50
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,509
It's called a rotation.

51
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,983
You're up till you catch one,
then you step down, work it for a while...

52
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,519
someone else steps up.

53
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,748
It's a simple but effective way
to do business...

54
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:07,226
in a town that has 250 to 300 cases a year.

55
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,619
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,096
But if someone gets it into his head
to leave the rotation...

57
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,101
it puts an unfair burden on other detectives
who have to pick up their casework.

58
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,398
Overworked cops make mistakes.

59
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,573
Mistakes lower the unit-wide clearance rate.

60
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,106
And that can make someone
who is otherwise as reasonable as me...

61
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,283
Unreasonable.

62
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,790
Detective McNulty, I expect to see
your ass back here next week...

63
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,489
when your shift rotates to night work.

64
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:32,811
- He's up early today.
- A lot of pager activity last night, too.

65
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,036
No woman takes that long.

66
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,916
Yeah. But I look good, right?

67
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,119
Wow. You did all this?

68
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,228
- Burned an egg or two. Ain't no thing.
- Yeah?

69
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,661
My mama always said:
"Don't let them get to cooking.

70
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,760
"Once they're in the kitchen, ain't nothing
left to do but give 'em a key to your house."

71
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,431
I don't want no key. I don't want no house.

72
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,009
And your mama don't know shit about me.

73
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,206
Looks just like you.

74
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,406
Yeah, he do.

75
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,274
Where's his mother?

76
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,114
Around the way.

77
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,650
Yeah. You friends?

78
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,891
You know, she want a key...

79
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,491
she want a house, she want a car,
she wants some new clothes, a necklace...

80
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:01,159
some pocket change, a trip to the shore,
she want a credit card with her name on it.

81
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,395
Ain't no such thing as free, right?

82
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,302
When it come to pussy, there ain't no free.

83
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,141
I gotta go.

84
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,454
Been working on this one.

85
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,761
You'll get the lines
on the other two payphones tomorrow.

86
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,700
- So we up?
- On the low-rise payphones, yeah.

87
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,237
Let's hear it.

88
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,933
See, what I'm talking about is he ain't
paid no one, hejust think it's right to do it.

89
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,472
See how it goes?
So I ain't got shit. I ain't got it.

90
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,006
Damn, for real?

91
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,285
Thinking he all that
because he got his family back.

92
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,655
- Hey, it was getting good.
- It's unmonitored.

93
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,747
It's what?

94
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,590
Unmonitored. We can't listen to a
conversation on an unmonitored payphone.

95
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,995
- What's that mean?
- We got a tap on the courtyard payphone.

96
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,660
By tomorrow,
we'll be up on two near the high-rises.

97
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,967
But we can't listen to anything unless we
know one of our targets is using the phone.

98
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,564
So we gotta be out there
on those rooftops for hours...

99
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,837
watching these assholes talk on the phone?

100
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,071
Yep.

101
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,742
It's more bullshit.

102
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,717
Detective, this right here, this is the job.

103
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:30,287
Now, when you came downtown to CID,
what kind of work were you expecting?

104
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,359
So what are you gonna do?

105
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,760
I can't get back here in a week,
this case is taking off.

106
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,226
You tell Rawls that?

107
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,331
- No.
- McNulty, Line 3.

108
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,564
Yeah?

109
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,004
Where at?

110
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,745
800 block, in the rear. Yeah, I got it.

111
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,544
Thanks. Yeah.

112
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,120
We're still waiting on a lab unit.
Do you have an ETA?

113
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,155
Negative. They're all out.

114
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:40,821
- Damn dog got Norris, too.
- You didn't think to warn me?

115
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,623
Too much fun not to.

116
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,357
Damn.

117
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,034
Is he one of yours?

118
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,161
We found him with Kevlar,
like the one Worden caught last week.

119
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,865
- We thought it might be a connection.
- Yeah, it connects.

120
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,032
How so?

121
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,707
Don't have a name, but he's
part of a stick-up crew.

122
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,578
Took off a stash house last month.
My guy, Barksdale, is coming back on them.

123
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:06,551
- In a big way.
- They must've killed him four or five times.

124
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,646
Cut him in a dozen places, burned him
with cigarettes. Torture-fest is what it was.

125
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,419
Doesn't look like your scene, either.

126
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,620
Fuck him up somewhere else,
dump him here for all to see.

127
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,959
- Anything we can use?
- Not yet.

128
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:21,364
We're up on some phones.
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

129
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,301
- Bring 22.
- 22.

130
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,602
Anything yet? Or are we just gonna let
this guy go ripe on us?

131
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,571
- You been waiting for crime lab?
- Over an hour.

132
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,579
Only two units on the street. Both are up
at the City Council President's house.

133
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,707
- What happened there?
- Someone stole his lawn furniture.

134
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:42,278
They're taking pictures of an empty patio,
dusting the backyard gate for latents.

135
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,686
I kid you not.

136
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,586
I swear, you show me the son of a bitch
who can fix this police department...

137
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,389
I'd give back half my overtime.

138
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,688
He was all cut up and shit.

139
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,893
His insides was hanging out.

140
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,670
Fucked up, yo. I mean, damn.

141
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,030
Sometimes you gotta send a message, yo.

142
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:06,005
I mean, when you picked up that phone,
what did you think they were gonna do?

143
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,640
- All that shit is in the game. You know that.
- Yeah.

144
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,547
Like you and that girl, huh?

145
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,084
- What girl?
- The one in the apartment.

146
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,356
The one you told us about, remember?

147
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:21,461
I mean, I like what you said
about all that killing, you know?

148
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,997
Especially that part about
how it ain't gotta be like that.

149
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,756
Just sell the shit and move on.

150
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,358
Get me a ginger ale
and get something for yourself.

151
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,231
Yeah, I remember that.
But it ain't like that, is it?

152
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,672
Yeah, I know. I know it ain't.

153
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,337
Thing about it was his eye.
His eye was blown out.

154
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,439
And the other one was open.
And yo, Dee, it fucks me up.

155
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,917
It's like he's looking out,
like he sees everything, you know?

156
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,019
Don't think about it.

157
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,560
- Fuck!
- Yo.

158
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,425
Let that shit go.

159
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,323
Just let it go.

160
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,182
Barksdale kid on the line.

161
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,319
He's beeping someone.

162
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,547
- Yo.
- What up?

163
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,585
Hold on.

164
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,492
Yo, Strings! This is Dee.

165
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,226
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you hit me?

166
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:12,601
Yeah, I wanted to know if you know a
young hopper, the one they got down there.

167
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,100
- Which one?
- The fool, drop in there with a punch.

168
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,440
- Yeah, what about him?
- He got some problems, right?

169
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,610
- What you mean?
- Enough to bring home, right?

170
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,782
You know, man, whatever.

171
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,248
All right.

172
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,934
They're bringing Bodie home.

173
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,443
A young boy who was with him,
light-skinned kid from the cemetery.

174
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,543
Where?

175
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,852
In the alley behind 800 block of Argyle,
across from the low-rises.

176
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,947
Shot?

177
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,524
- Stabbed, beaten, burned.
- Jesus.

178
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,654
- Yeah, we gotta get with Omar.
- Yeah.

179
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,605
Impressive.

180
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:28,347
I don't often see a respondent come so
prepared for a juvenile commitment meeting.

181
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,417
In addition to the signed statements
from Preston's sponsors...

182
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,383
at the Police Athletic League...

183
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,615
I also have a Photostatted copy
of a cashed check...

184
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,317
which indicates that he is enrolled
in the GED program...

185
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,724
at the Baltimore City Community College.

186
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:47,592
Can I ask how this young man is able
to afford not one...

187
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,762
- but two attorneys from your firm, Mr. Levy?
- This is pro bono, Your Honor.

188
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:55,239
My firm is making it a priority to identify
a number of city youths...

189
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:59,608
who are in crisis, and to undertake efforts
to reorder their lives.

190
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:04,078
Excuse me, I can't help but notice that
your client is under a delinquent petition...

191
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,745
for the sale of narcotics, and further,
for assault on a police officer.

192
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,448
Beyond that,
he walked away from a JSA facility.

193
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,821
You Honor, my client stands
ready to acknowledge...

194
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,794
that he was involved for a time
in the sale of a small amount of drugs...

195
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,559
a transaction for which
he received no remuneration...

196
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,500
having been manipulated
by older traffickers in his neighborhood.

197
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,538
- That was a mistake, Your Honor.
- So noted.

198
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:31,267
We will contend that it was Preston who
was the victim of a brutal police beating...

199
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,211
indications of which
are still evident on him, Your Honor.

200
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,772
He struck back,
wildly and in self-defense, Your Honor.

201
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,211
And the walk-away?

202
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,777
Preston was heavily medicated
when he left the Cheltenham facility.

203
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,720
In that state, Your Honor...

204
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:48,352
he was simply trying to get back
to see his grandmother.

205
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,994
Did you know what you were doing
when you left the Boys' Village, son?

206
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,898
- No, I was messed up.
- Anything else you'd like to add?

207
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,168
Just...

208
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,168
I don't know...

209
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,142
I'm ready to be good.

210
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,652
Pending a hearing on these charges
to be scheduled within six months...

211
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:17,883
I'm putting the respondent
on home monitoring with his grandmother.

212
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,757
Your honor, I'm afraid Mrs. Brodus
doesn't have a telephone...

213
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,191
for any monitoring calls.
She's on a fixed income, Your Honor.

214
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:29,029
How about he calls his probation officer
twice a week?

215
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,061
Cool. Whatever...

216
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,405
Your Honor.

217
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,570
- Yo, Bubbles, what's the game?
- Hey, Johnny.

218
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,536
- Rubbing them down, huh?
- Yeah.

219
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:14,075
- What is the scam out here?
- Ain't no scam.

220
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,744
Thank you, ma'am.

221
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:20,041
What you got here is an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay. Right, Lavelle?

222
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,121
Mr. Straight Time, Bubbles.

223
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,055
Gotta give something back
when they least expect it.

224
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,059
Me and Uck, here, we got something on, too.
We got a plan.

225
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,529
- No shit.
- For real.

226
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,765
Yo, we're gonna take off
on the copper house.

227
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,671
Damn, your first two days out
and you get dramatic on me.

228
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,801
- Copper house.
- Got to be got, homes.

229
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,471
- What about the fence?
- Fuck the fence.

230
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,547
- What about the dog?
- Fuck the dog.

231
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,245
All that time I was resting,
it got me thinking. It got good to me, too.

232
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,987
Copper house. Gracious.

233
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,753
I gotta go, can you cash me out?

234
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,929
If you ain't got dreams, Bubs,
what the fuck you got?

235
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,795
Thank you. Come on, dreamer.

236
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:34,961
Yeah.

237
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:37,696
- One of ours on the line.
- Got him.

238
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,359
- Is Carv still there?
- Hold a second.

239
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,469
Carv, call for you!

240
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,398
- Yeah, hello?
- You ain't gonna believe who I'm looking at.

241
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,931
Again he walks off?

242
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,804
Ding! Round three.

243
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,047
- Yo.
- What up, man?

244
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,023
- Yo, Stink, what up?
- Where are your manners, fool?

245
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,586
- Oh, my bad, yeah.
- You need to keep your fucking head, boy.

246
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,822
Forgot.

247
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:18,028
- What's up? Where you at?
- Where you at?

248
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,935
I'm down in the Pit. I just came home...

249
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,341
I don't see nobody around,
I just wanted to know what was up.

250
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,473
Ain't nothing going late, man.

251
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,775
Just catch us tomorrow, man.

252
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,315
- All right?
- All right, yeah.

253
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,219
All right. Later.

254
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,092
"Non-pertinent"?

255
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,394
How do you log that non-pertinent?

256
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,932
No drug talk.

257
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:52,000
They use codes
that hide their pager and phone numbers.

258
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:55,998
And when someone does use a phone,
they don't use names.

259
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:59,405
And if someone does use a name,
he's reminded not to.

260
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,743
All of that is valuable evidence.

261
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,913
- Of what?
- Conspiracy.

262
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,385
Conspiracy?

263
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,192
We're building something here, detective.
We're building it from scratch.

264
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:16,494
All the pieces matter.

265
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,155
All right?

266
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,769
Shit.

267
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,117
Shit!

268
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,817
Are you fucking serious?

269
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,211
Fuck, man.

270
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,452
You keep walking away from JSA,
we keep kicking your ass.

271
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,220
- I'm all right with that if you are.
- I ain't walk away from nowhere, man.

272
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,091
Check my back pocket.

273
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,465
- "Home monitoring"?
- Yeah, man.

274
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:05,136
If you ask questions before you start wildin'
on niggers, you might save some trouble.

275
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,940
How the fuck are you home?

276
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,571
You ain't bright, man.

277
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,411
Juvenile judge, man.

278
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,452
He saw my potential.
He expects big things from me.

279
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,816
Yeah, like what?

280
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,752
I don't know, college, law school,
medical school, all that good shit.

281
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,317
- Seriously, how are you out?
- Look, I'm gonna tell you something.

282
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,590
Okay, this is just my opinion, but...

283
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:29,595
the juvenile system in this city is fucked up.
It's a big-ass fucking joke. No offense.

284
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,297
Fucking fuck!

285
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,007
You could give me a ride down
to my grandma's, we'll call it even.

286
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:43,614
In back, fucknuts.

287
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,292
Get outta the street!

288
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,687
Bitch!

289
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,341
What's up? What you need?

291
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:49,481
- Little late in the month for this shit, don't you think?
- What you mean?

292
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:59,523
- For my aunt, she hit the Match Four.
- You stealing from me, Cass?

293
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,266
What?

294
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:19,574
You look fresh today.

295
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,014
- Got laid last night, that's why.
- Oh, yeah? Your asshole still hurting?

296
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,813
- Call Jimmy.
- What's up, boss?

297
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:32,990
Rawls finally got around to reading the
office reports that McNulty tried to give him.

298
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,687
He wants arrest warrants
for Diedre Kresson...

299
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:39,197
and the two project murders
that match up to that gun.

300
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,695
I know.

301
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:46,906
- Come on, Jay, be right on this.
- I can't. It's Rawls, he wants warrants today.

302
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,644
All right, no problem. So who the fuck
are we supposed to charge?

303
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,608
You got a witness
that puts D'Angelo Barksdale...

304
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:56,444
at the scene of the murder,
the night of the murder.

305
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,316
You got a ballistics match between
the Kresson girl and the two dead mopes...

306
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,583
in the project where Barksdale hangs.
Run with it.

307
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,785
This weak-ass shit
is not gonna get past the Grand Jury.

308
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:09,419
Charge the mope,
and work it more afterward.

309
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,623
Call Jimmy, let him know.

310
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:17,962
Yo.

311
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,971
All right, listen up. New deal.

312
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:28,479
Wallace, you're gonna be on the stash now
with Latroy and Peaches.

313
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:29,947
What about Sterling?

314
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,451
He's gonna be down on Crescent,
looking out for a while. Cassandra, too.

315
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:35,249
- What happened?
- Nothing.

316
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:39,291
- Why you wanna change up, then?
- Nigger, I gotta explain shit to you now?

317
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,358
Stringer Bell's pager number?

318
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,098
- Stinkum's too, I'm pretty sure.
- Very sweet.

319
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,601
If they moved around,
then nobody would have problems.

320
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,471
They're a little lazy, you know...

321
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:01,203
tend to go to that one payphone
in the courtyard a little too much.

322
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,740
Jesus.

323
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,787
He's lit at 9:00 in the morning?

324
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,520
Or from the night before.

325
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,262
Detective.

326
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,235
Detective Polk.

327
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:35,647
Yeah, it's McNulty. Bunk paged me.

328
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:38,677
All right.

329
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,363
Why did you even come in today?

330
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:54,061
- I had some...
- To pretend that you were here?

331
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,301
To fill out a run sheet?

332
00:28:57,304 --> 00:28:59,932
I know I missed a couple of days
last week, Lieutenant, but...

333
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,975
I got a run sheet from you every day
for the last two weeks.

334
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:07,137
Twice in Carv's handwriting,
twice it was Prez, once it was McNulty.

335
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,780
They covered for you.

336
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,676
But I won't.

337
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,079
Well, Lieutenant, I...

338
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:22,227
I don't know. I'm not really
up for this drug thing, you know?

339
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,263
Maybe if Mahone was here, I could...

340
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,860
get into it more, learn some new tricks.

341
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:35,530
Hell, why don't you just send me back
to Property and keep everyone happy?

342
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:39,009
Send you back to Property Crimes
so you can binge for two more weeks?

343
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,409
I'm not doing that.

344
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,411
- Lieutenant, please...
- You were dumped on me, Augie.

345
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,785
But it ends there. I don't dump people.

346
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:52,219
You either go out on those rooftops today
to watch payphones with the others...

347
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:55,261
or you go over to the medical office
and check yourself in.

348
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,290
- Medical?
- For alcohol abuse.

349
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,131
Either dry yourself out
or go up on those rooftops wet.

350
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,345
Take a few minutes and think on it.

351
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,488
- Where'd they go?
- Who?

352
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,162
Lieutenant...

353
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:35,090
we need a file cabinet or two.
The paperwork from this, I mean...

354
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,131
there's a lot of it.

355
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,233
Lieutenant...

356
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:41,899
sir...

357
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,834
I'm going to...

358
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,442
Good luck with the case.

359
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,393
Fucking Rawls,
he's fucking up the case to get to me.

360
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:05,864
No, he's fucking it up for three paper
clearances on prior cases. It ain't personal.

361
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,491
All he's got is D'Angelo
at the scene through hearsay...

362
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:12,436
and a ballistics match to a couple unrelated
drug murders. How can he charge that?

363
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,235
He can charge anything he wants
to get credit for clearance.

364
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:18,140
Grand Jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case, keeps his stats.

365
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,805
- I'll go tell him what the fuck he can do.
- No you don't.

366
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:24,611
I'm trying to build something here.
Rawls just sticks a finger in my eye.

367
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,982
- You talk to Landsman?
- Jay can't fix this.

368
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:30,179
Rawls told him to have the warrants typed
and ready by morning.

369
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,657
He's gonna charge murders he can't prove
just to get the stats?

370
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,250
And fuck up our case in the process.

371
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:38,297
We give up ballistics info and motive
for the Kresson killing...

372
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,424
in the charging documents,
and Avon Barksdale is gonna change up.

373
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,800
And what he don't change up he'll clean up.
Someone should tell Rawls.

374
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:48,136
Rawls couldn't care less.
He wants me home, and the stats, that's all.

375
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,038
- Then we take it to Daniels.
- Daniels?

376
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,611
- It's his case, he'll fight for it.
- He won't do shit.

377
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:55,146
He plays stiff every now and then,
but he's a good man.

378
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,613
Are you kidding me?

379
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:59,241
He's been trying to put the brakes on this
for weeks now.

380
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,479
This'll be his new excuse to close shop.

381
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,648
Look, you guys gotta make your move soon,
I'm sorry to say.

382
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,590
- Freamon.
- All right, Bunk, take care.

383
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,355
We tell Daniels.

384
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:13,695
Fuck Daniels and his ass-kissing
up-the-chain-of-command ambition.

385
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,563
What other choice you got, huh?

386
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:18,360
We go to Daniels. If he fights, he fights.

387
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:22,465
If he gives it up to Rawls, then fuck it,
we were never gonna do the case anyway.

388
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:26,645
All right, come on.

389
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:03,913
Fucking idiot!

390
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,854
- Come on, get up, stupid.
- I'm hurt, man.

391
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:12,447
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

392
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,956
- What, are you on dope or something?
- Mostly, yes.

393
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:16,619
Come on, get up.

394
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:20,130
You trying to rip out my guts?

395
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,428
- Fuck.
- What, are you trying to kill me, man?

396
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:25,835
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Listen, I gotta get help.

397
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:28,271
You can't leave me here.
You gotta stay with me.

398
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,967
Let's go over to the curb.

399
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:33,273
Just go get help, man! What are you doing?

400
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,847
Stay there!

401
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,408
- Damn, boy! What the hell come out of you?
- Onion soup. Campbell's.

402
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,421
- Yeah, my plan!
- Run, Forrest, run!

403
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,653
You could go to Foerster,
or the Deputy Ops.

404
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,892
Why come crying to me?

405
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,733
Why not go to your friend, the judge?

406
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,594
I don't see a circuit court judge
being able to argue...

407
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,171
the city homicide commander
out of three murders...

408
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:03,566
even if the cases are all weak sisters.
It's put-up or shut-up time, Lieutenant.

409
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:06,908
- Either you step up or you send us all home.
- So this is on me?

410
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:09,447
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.

411
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:13,852
- Rawls is a major.
- Rawls is an asshole.

412
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:17,012
My point is, he ranks me on this.

413
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:22,156
Chain of command might mean
nothing to you, McNulty.

414
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,467
What'd I tell you?

415
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,567
- Yo, how we doing?
- We doing good.

416
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,097
You know, if you say we doing good...

417
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,113
So the word is out
about these stick-up boys, right?

418
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,239
Yeah, y'all being heard.

419
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,049
There goes shorty right there.

420
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,557
What's up, man, you know...

421
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,618
I'm a man of my word.
I said it would be $4,000 to Omar...

422
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:07,421
$2,000 on each of the young ones,
this being a team effort.

423
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:10,736
I'm putting $500 in the boy's hand
who's doing the scope...

424
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:13,465
$500 in your hand for doing the relay...

425
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:17,236
put $500 in Wee-Bey and Bird's hands
for doing the muscling up.

426
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,773
- All right.
- How you doing with that other thing?

427
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,104
What?

428
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,345
Everybody a little depressed, right?

429
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:29,445
Oh, yeah, you know, ain't no surprises yet.

430
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,082
Cut everybody loose on Friday...

431
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,956
and they all just a bunch
of begging-ass bitches.

432
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,095
I mean, ain't nobody showed
no money since.

433
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,597
- You gonna keep it humming, cuz?
- Yeah, you know.

434
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:42,333
Oh! You got your hands up.

435
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:47,002
You keep on doing like how you're doing
we'll talk about points on the package.

436
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,102
- All right?
- All right.

437
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,944
- Keep it humming.
- Yeah, most def.

438
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,016
- All right, then.
- Take it light, but take it.

439
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,720
Hotter than the Wu-Tang, killer bee.

440
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:35,143
- 40 cents.
- Not 40 cents a foot, no sir.

441
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,116
Look, respectfully, I gotta tell you...

442
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:41,159
for 40 cents a foot, you might as well
go to Home Depot, pay them.

443
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,424
They're gonna charge you
45 or 50 cents a foot.

444
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:46,362
For copper that isn't stolen.

445
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:50,292
Look, all right, 35 cents a foot.

446
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:54,203
And that's in respect I have for y'all,
what you're doing in our community...

447
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,605
with these quality domiciles here.

448
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,603
Thirty cents a foot, take it or leave it.

449
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:08,016
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, I do.

450
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,484
But charging those murders now...

451
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,356
and putting the information that we have
into the charging documents...

452
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,588
I just call them like I see them, Lieutenant.

453
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:21,224
Three murders, same gun, we got this
Barksdale kid right at the scene on the one.

454
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,895
We're up on the wire.
We're starting to pull good information.

455
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,532
You charge these prematurely
and Barksdale will change up on us.

456
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,871
- The work we've already done...
- Look...

457
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:34,310
I can't tell you how to run your case,
I can only run my own.

458
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,574
Major...

459
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,051
I'm asking as a favor.

460
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,855
- As a favor.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,213
A favor.

462
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:46,551
In that case...

463
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,953
No. Sorry.

464
00:38:56,436 --> 00:39:00,133
- You got home from work early today.
- Yep. Work sucks.

465
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:03,936
- Are we eating dinner with you?
- Why not?

466
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:09,377
- You promised we'd eat lasagna.
- So we'll go to Little ltaly.

467
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,177
Get some lasagna at Sab's.

468
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:14,610
- You never cook.
- Yeah, cooking sucks, too.

469
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,036
- Who's this?
- Hey, yo, I wanna see him.

470
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:38,443
- Who?
- Brandon, my boy.

471
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,218
- Copper house, yo.
- Was the shit.

472
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,393
My plan, Bubs.

473
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:02,933
Johnny had a plan.

474
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,971
Get out the way, motherfuckers.

475
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,507
This here is White Boy Day.

476
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,942
- I got a plan, too.
- What?

477
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:18,345
We're gonna wait for that cheap-ass,
speculating motherfucker...

478
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:23,552
to put that good copper line
back into them row houses he's fixing up.

479
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:27,492
Then, before the drywall get up...

480
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,360
we creep back in there,
and steal that shit right back.

481
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,824
30 cents a foot.

482
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:39,466
Gotta come back at the motherfucker
for that, you know?

483
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,898
Yeah.

484
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,840
You good?

485
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:50,239
I could top off with one more.

486
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,113
- Yeah.
- Just one more.

487
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,826
Johnny got it.

488
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:03,928
I'll be back.

489
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:30,755
It's my night with the kids.

490
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,706
You ain't gonna find nothing,
because I didn't do nothing!

491
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,800
Why don't you just leave me alone, man?

492
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:55,403
A white man can't walk down the street?
What's that about? Come on, man!

493
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:58,610
It's messed up, all right?

494
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:00,443
Profiling!

495
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:04,114
What? It's 'cause I'm white, right?
Why don't you let me...

496
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:07,852
Oh, man, what the fuck's that? What's that?

497
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,457
That boy ain't got no luck.

498
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,540
All right. Hold up!

499
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,816
- Hey.
- Hey.

500
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:45,758
So, what are you going to do
with your money?

501
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:48,627
You know what you should do?

502
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,465
Take the whole roll
and do something nice for your girl.

503
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,539
You do have a girl, right?

504
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:58,837
Anyway, you've got enough money
to go get yourself one now.

505
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:04,640
Why'd you punk Sterling like you did?

506
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:07,148
I mean, he did get shot behind this shit.

507
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,585
- I didn't punk him.
- So why are you dropping the lookout?

508
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,518
Cass, too.

509
00:43:12,892 --> 00:43:15,861
'Cause they was thieving. Both of them.

510
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,997
They got pissed
'cause I wasn't paying them.

511
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,329
So Sterling started shaking up the vials,
handing off to Cass.

512
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,528
She was selling on the side.

513
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:28,273
You didn't tell anybody? Stinkum, Bodie?

514
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:30,300
They don't know?

515
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,969
If I tell them,
what you think they're going to do?

516
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:36,710
They're going to take a baseball bat
to Sterling. Cassandra, too.

517
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,517
It's too much drama, right?

518
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:42,420
So, I just took them both off the stash.

519
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:44,319
So why didn't you pay us?

520
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:47,886
That wasn't right.

521
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:50,795
Listen, man...

522
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:54,330
Stringer thought we had a snitch down here.

523
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:57,698
You know, with the jump-out,
Omar, all that shit.

524
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:01,065
So he told me to punk you all
for a little while.

525
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,802
See who was still holding money
at the end of the week.

526
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,502
Was they snitching?

527
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:07,140
Sterling and Cass?

528
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,278
No, man, just thieving.

529
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:18,380
2-0, Orioles, in the first inning.

530
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:20,755
All right, going to Homicide.

531
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:23,823
Okay, you two, you sit right here, okay?

532
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,522
Don't wander off.

533
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:28,993
- Dad?
- What?

534
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,831
It's a school night. Mom said we had to...

535
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:34,736
I know, I know. We will. Just stay there.

536
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,568
Runners at second and third,
nobody out yet here in the first inning.

537
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,743
Here's Mora at the plate,
and the pitch is high.

538
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,109
Lopez on the mound. The pitch is outside.

539
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,878
15 pitches and 10 of them have been balls.

540
00:45:02,735 --> 00:45:05,795
It's a ground ball down the right-field line.

541
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:38,128
64-Charlie to Central K.

542
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,698
You up to this?

543
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,536
Pay it back, Omar. Pay it back.

544
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:21,102
Why we ain't in a real police office?

545
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,972
We're a little like you, Omar.

546
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:26,381
Out here on our own,
playing the game for ourselves.

547
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:33,923
Hard way to go sometimes.

548
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:39,528
Sorry about your friend.

549
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,935
Avon is one sick bastard.

550
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:45,964
Of course, he had his reasons.

551
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:48,302
For one thing, you all did take his stash.

552
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,967
For another, he's looking for you, Omar.

553
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,840
That's what all the cigarette burns
were about.

554
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:56,608
The broken fingers and cracked forearms.

555
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,114
He wanted your boy to give you up.

556
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,948
An address, a street.

557
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:04,712
Kid had heart.

558
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:06,682
Yeah.

559
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,793
I know you want to go to
wherever it is you lay your head...

560
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:15,298
and pick up that sawed-off you like
so much, and go on the hunt.

561
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:18,197
That's how a man like you wants to carry.

562
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:20,932
- You wouldn't be wrong.
- No, you wouldn't.

563
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,009
But one man with two barrels
ain't enough, Omar.

564
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,806
Now, you're going to do
what you're going to do.

565
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:30,814
But whatever else you can give us
on Barksdale and his people...

566
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,177
that can go to hurting him, too.

567
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,577
Just throw us what you can.

568
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:39,552
Let me tell you all something, all right?

569
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:43,351
What I do, I do, straight like that.

570
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:46,327
Ain't no sense
in you all troubling yourselves over that...

571
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:49,196
'cause the way I feel right now, today...

572
00:47:57,143 --> 00:47:59,236
What do you all need from me?

573
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,475
When did you last see Brandon?

574
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,517
Tuesday around 7:00. Maybe later.

575
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:10,854
He was on his way down to Mindamin...

576
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:12,446
and the Greek's after that.

577
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,220
Everybody's talking about
he got snatched up from there.

578
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,261
The Greek's on Baltimore Street?

579
00:48:17,363 --> 00:48:20,355
Yeah, he liked to play
the pinball games to death.

580
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:21,899
He go alone?

581
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:25,103
Yeah, and I didn't like it none, neither.

582
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:30,303
But you can only treat a young man
like a boy for so long before they book.

583
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:32,008
When Bailey got killed...

584
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:34,705
you must have figured
Barksdale was coming back on you?

585
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:36,145
Bailey? Please.

586
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,341
That nigger's enemies got enemies.

587
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:42,153
I just figured he tried his hand
on the wrong corner and got dropped.

588
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:44,916
But you were worried about Brandon, right?

589
00:48:45,324 --> 00:48:46,689
Look, in my game...

590
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:49,784
you take some kid,
you play it the safest way you can.

591
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:52,430
But it ain't about no hiding forever.

592
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:53,890
You heard?

593
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:56,331
Frankly, you been in it as long as me...

594
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:58,096
you do the thing on your name.

595
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:01,637
Anyone going to come after Omar,
they know Omar's coming after him.

596
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,071
Oh, indeed.

597
00:49:04,243 --> 00:49:06,302
So, who came after Brandon?

598
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:09,611
I heard it might have been Wee-Bey...

599
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,906
his boy Stinkum...

600
00:49:12,518 --> 00:49:13,712
and Bird.

601
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:16,149
He was down with the snatch, too.

602
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:25,152
So, what can you give us on the job?

603
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,297
7:56 Tuesday night,
you had an incoming call...

604
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:32,302
to D'Angelo Barksdale's,
giving him the number of a pay phone.

605
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,066
Westside exchange.
Number's encoded, right?

606
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:40,471
Three minutes later, we get another call
from the low-rises to that number.

607
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,810
Then, a half-minute later,
you get another call from the low-rises...

608
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,850
to a pager we know is Stringer Bell's.

609
00:49:45,951 --> 00:49:46,940
I'll be damned.

610
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:49,316
Finally, you get another call.

611
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:53,086
Probably from a pay phone.
Probably Stringer Bell calling back.

612
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:55,319
Coming on into the low-rise courts.

613
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:58,885
Forty-five minutes later, another call.

614
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:02,760
This one from the same pay phone
that went to D'Angelo's pager...

615
00:50:02,868 --> 00:50:05,029
to start the whole thing off. You see that?

616
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:06,627
This is the murder, right here.

617
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:10,299
This first number,
the one they sent to D'Angelo...

618
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:14,539
I'm thinking this comes from a pay phone
over by the Greek's.

619
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:24,349
He's on you.

620
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:26,424
We're up on those pay phones
Tuesday night...

621
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:28,891
we catch that murder.
We get there before the murder.

622
00:50:28,994 --> 00:50:30,393
It's all here on the pen register.

623
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:33,522
This one calling that one,
that one calling back.

624
00:50:33,632 --> 00:50:36,829
We're up on those pay phones
when we should be, and we have him cold.

625
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:38,699
But we're not up in time, are we?

626
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:41,466
In this case,
we're never where we need to be.

627
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:55,048
Bad time for you all?

628
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:11,760
He fight, but you arrest.

629
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:14,102
You saw him get arrested?

630
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:16,839
- On Tuesday?
- Tuesday, yes. Tuesday.

631
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:19,536
By the police? The police arrested him?

632
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:21,979
Cops, they handcuffed him?

633
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:26,314
What about these guys?

634
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:28,383
Were they there with him?

635
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:29,476
No.

636
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:35,553
- He fight, you arrest.
- Right.

637
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:39,027
Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you.

638
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:47,704
It's a match.

639
00:51:49,742 --> 00:51:50,766
No.

640
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:53,877
I need help. Rawls ranks me.

641
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,948
Lieutenant, think what you're doing here.

642
00:51:57,816 --> 00:52:00,182
You're going to cross Bill Rawls...

643
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:03,614
as ruthless a fuck
as we have in this department?

644
00:52:04,456 --> 00:52:06,083
And to do what?

645
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,726
To fight for a case the Deputy of Operations
doesn't even want.

646
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:13,755
No.

647
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,861
I like my career, thank you very much.

648
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:24,738
In the cemetery, you were telling us that
a guy named Bird killed the working man.

649
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:27,738
Yeah, the man who testified.

650
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:30,177
William Gant. Right.

651
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,612
Yeah, Bird did that one, for sure.

652
00:52:32,718 --> 00:52:35,380
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.

653
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:38,115
Nigger walked up behind the man
and shot him in the head.

654
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:40,453
The whole blessed project saw that much.

655
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:42,451
And Bird worked for Avon?

656
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:44,620
Yeah, as one of his shooters.

657
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:46,628
Liked to use this real sweet gun he got.

658
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:49,826
A .380 from Austria or Australia.
Something like that.

659
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:51,766
But I know he loved that gun.

660
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:52,837
A .380.

661
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:55,438
Yeah, a .380. You get him, you get the gun.

662
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,601
'Cause Bird's too dumb
to throw a gun like that off.

663
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:01,311
- A gun alone ain't enough.
- Oh, no?

664
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:04,507
He testifies he bought the gun on the street
after Gant was killed.

665
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:07,141
- What would be enough, then?
- Eyeball witness.

666
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:10,619
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.

667
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:16,551
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

668
00:53:17,096 --> 00:53:19,587
- I'm your man.
- You saw the murder?

669
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:21,323
Yeah.

670
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:25,631
You can ID this man, Bird,
as the shooter of William Gant?

671
00:53:26,605 --> 00:53:28,732
And you ain't afraid to go into court...

672
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:31,503
and testify against
one of Barksdale's people?

673
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:34,876
Omar don't scare.

674
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:41,184
The fact is that while Lt. Daniels
and his merry band are lost in the swamps...

675
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:44,221
playing with beepers and pay phones
and body mikes...

676
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:48,020
my people have developed information
that ties Barksdale to three killings.

677
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:51,790
- D'Angelo Barksdale, not Avon.
- D'Angelo on behalf of Avon.

678
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:56,600
The victim is identified by our witnesses
as being involved with Avon Barksdale.

679
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:58,662
Sir, we're developing...

680
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:01,137
You're dancing around this thing.

681
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,306
I'm charging three murders.

682
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,469
You charge those cases,
my investigation folds.

683
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:09,839
Not one of those cases is strong enough
for court. You know that.

684
00:54:09,948 --> 00:54:12,075
So we bring the Barksdale kid in...

685
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:15,119
throw a little mindfuck at him
and the case becomes stronger.

686
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,156
You've had him in the box twice before.
He's gonna go for less the third time.

687
00:54:19,258 --> 00:54:22,159
So we re-canvass, develop fresh witnesses.

688
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:26,797
The case I charge on today
can be twice as strong by the trial date.

689
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:28,866
We get a conviction...

690
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:32,232
we roll Little Boy Barksdale
into Big Boy Barksdale...

691
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,331
then we go home...

692
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:37,874
like good old-fashioned cops
and pound some Budweiser.

693
00:54:39,678 --> 00:54:42,613
This is bullshit!

694
00:54:43,816 --> 00:54:46,910
It was McNulty who made
the ballistics match on these murders...

695
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:48,543
and he's telling me to fight this.

696
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:50,679
He knows you don't have
a viable prosecution...

697
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,586
so do you, so do I.

698
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:53,919
Enough.

699
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,721
Look, I've got no love
for your wiretap, Lieutenant.

700
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,630
I'm spending $2,000 a day...

701
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:06,490
over the unit operating budget to staff the case.

702
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:09,069
Now, Major Rawls here
is offering a chance...

703
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:12,268
to leverage Barksdale
through a murder prosecution.

704
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:14,140
Why not jump on this?

705
00:55:15,347 --> 00:55:18,111
Because if Major Rawls is right...

706
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:21,776
then he will be just as right
a month from now.

707
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,556
If the wire doesn't give us a case,
he can charge all the murders he has.

708
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:27,181
We lose nothing.

709
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:29,453
But if he's wrong...

710
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:33,153
if he can't convict,
or if the Barksdale kid doesn't flip...

711
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,563
then it's too late to do anything else.

712
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:40,504
Avon Barksdale changes up his pattern,
and the wiretap dies.

713
00:55:40,606 --> 00:55:43,040
At that point,
there isn't going to be a thing...

714
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:47,373
that you, or me, or Rawls here
is gonna be able to say to that judge.

715
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:58,379
You wanted to see me, Major?

716
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,889
McNulty does personal business
on the clock, I want to know.

717
00:56:01,994 --> 00:56:04,485
He cheats on a run sheet, I want to know.

718
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:06,962
He runs any kind of game at all,
I want to know.

719
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:09,363
Major, the man's an asshole...

720
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:14,434
but he doesn't do much other than work.
He's got this case in his gut like it's cancer.

721
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,098
He does no wrong?

722
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:18,904
Doesn't drink anymore?

723
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:22,469
Doesn't drink on duty?
Doesn't drink and drive, Detective?

724
00:56:22,981 --> 00:56:25,916
- Major...
- You've got to help me on this, Michael.

725
00:56:47,606 --> 00:56:49,597
The murder warrant's on hold.

726
00:56:50,876 --> 00:56:53,037
The Deputy gave us another month.

727
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,913
Also, whoever that was
you brought in here today...

728
00:56:57,015 --> 00:56:59,984
gave himself up
as an eyewitness to the Gant murder.

729
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:01,515
Who? Omar?

730
00:57:01,987 --> 00:57:05,320
Greggs said to tell you
she'd write it up in the morning.

731
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,492
Lieutenant...

732
00:57:09,795 --> 00:57:10,989
thanks.

733
00:57:17,803 --> 00:57:19,168
It cost you?
