Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,681
Fuck me.

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,115
I'm dying here.

4
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:27,351
Let me get on the other side,
work it from there.

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,660
One, two.

6
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:31,889
- Three.
- Three.

7
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,033
Shit.

8
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,609
Need help?

9
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,687
Right. On three, motherfuckers.
One, two, three.

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,591
I'm embarrassed for you all.

11
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:12,161
Yo, Herc, I catch my breath,
I'm gonna shoot the drawers off this bitch.

12
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,296
It's caught on something, Lieutenant.

13
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,166
Get over there with Carver.

14
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,187
One, two, you know what to do.

15
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,590
What the fuck?

16
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,567
Jesus. My ass is kicked.

17
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,873
I could move it a bit when I was alone.
It must've got wedged in the door somehow.

18
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,242
Desk is empty, right?

19
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,517
- Yeah.
- You checked it?

20
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,653
At this rate, we're never gonna get it in.

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,121
What?

22
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:12,956
In?

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
In.

24
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,172
Unbelievable, unbe-fucking-lievable.

25
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,868
Christ.

26
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,590
This case is a bit humble for you.

27
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,756
I know it doesn't look like much on paper,
but see what you can do.

28
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,265
- Making new friends?
- Not yet.

29
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,008
I spent the morning down in juvenile court...

30
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:40,237
but the kids know they can't be hurt
with a street-weight charge...

31
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,973
so didn't get much there.

32
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,070
You tried?

33
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,984
Nothing like being told,
"Fuck off," by a 14-year-old.

34
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,880
- Right here's our best shot.
- Him?

35
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,092
Hand-to-hand with Bubbles,
and he's carrying a long-ass sheet.

36
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,789
All right. Who's first? Ms. Dawkins?

37
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,056
State versus Marvin Browning, Your Honor.

38
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,361
One count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, heroin...

39
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,769
and one count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, cocaine.

40
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,932
- Quantity?
- One gelcap and one vial, Your Honor.

41
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,775
Bail recommendation?

42
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:16,746
State requests defendant be held,
as he is part of a continuing investigation...

43
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,046
and further, is subject to a mandatory
five years without parole...

44
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,483
because of prior convictions.

45
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,420
Will your office be seeking
the mandatory five in this case?

46
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,888
Absolutely, Your Honor.

47
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,056
Very well, I'll take that into consideration.

48
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,657
Got his attention, at least.

49
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,541
Lieutenant, come have a taste.

50
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,007
Come on, we're celebrating.

51
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,679
Patrick's going out on medical.

52
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,740
Sweet, sweet Cervical 6.

53
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,546
My shoulder's numb, my arm's numb.

54
00:05:56,722 --> 00:06:00,488
My fingers feel like they belong to
some son of a bitch in the next county.

55
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,051
This is my ticket out of
this rat-shit department.

56
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,997
66 2/3% pension,
and I don't have to wait for my 30.

57
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,796
- I'm gone.
- Fucking yo did you a favor.

58
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,732
Kid hit like a mule, I've got to say.

59
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,296
You should take a couple of days.
Think it over before you put in papers.

60
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,275
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.

61
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,279
Does $6,000 a week straight rentals,
another $8,000 in porn.

62
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,706
He needs a partner.

63
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,184
But they take that off
the top of a medical pension.

64
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,586
If you report it as income, they do.
Do I look that fucking stupid?

65
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,554
Have a nice life, Lieutenant.

66
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,496
What's with you?

67
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,974
You gonna miss me, Augs?

68
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,003
What the fuck am I going to do, Paddy?

69
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,778
Tell you what.

70
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,408
- What do you say we go out together?
- What do you mean?

71
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:02,783
I mean, it only hurts for a minute.
And it doesn't have to be line-of-duty either.

72
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm serious. You know those stairs where
they send us down to the basement?

73
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,523
- Yeah.
- It's dark down there.

74
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:13,154
You go up eight or nine steps,
let go of the rail, take a little jump...

75
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:16,894
- I'd break my fucking neck like that.
- You don't break nothing.

76
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:21,433
You do a little dance on those steps,
you're up to two-thirds with me.

77
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,375
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.

78
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,575
Can't say we don't deserve it.

79
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,344
Five in. For a one-and-one.

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,252
Now, why bang me like that
for a one-and-one?

81
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,792
Because it's your turn, Mr. Browning.
Everybody out there gets a turn.

82
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,894
You're all running wild here.
I think a judge might want to...

83
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,191
take a look at this
and slow you all down a mite.

84
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,063
I don't know, Marvin.
I'm looking at your sheet here, and...

85
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,238
for one thing, it's a little wrong
to be calling it a sheet.

86
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,035
More like a book.

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,770
Point is, we got the room
to get a little crazy on you.

88
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,607
Like she said, it's your turn.

89
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,514
Tell us some stories,
it could be somebody else's turn.

90
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,847
Stories.

91
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,815
Avon Barksdale.

92
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:13,213
Know the name?

93
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,123
Every motherfucker up in them towers
knows the name.

94
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,753
Myself, I ain't never really
had a word with the man.

95
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,422
Stringer Bell, then?

96
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,393
Wee-Bey? Savino?
Stinkum? C.C.O.? Roc-Roc?

97
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,931
Who're you gonna give us, Marvin?

98
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,809
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.

99
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,406
All right.

100
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,976
All right, what?

101
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,674
All right, I'll take the years.

102
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,060
Damn, boy.

103
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,801
You should see the cop.

104
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,670
When you're ready to get up, put that on.

105
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,899
- Report to bunk A-7.
- A-7.

106
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,044
Don't be later than breakfast.

107
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,219
Who else is up in here?
Anybody from Westside?

108
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,954
D.C. boys, mostly.

109
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,742
Long fucking drive.
Me and you drawing another shit detail.

110
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,652
- This ain't a shit detail.
- No?

111
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,947
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,
and still going south.

112
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,587
Look. Another cow.

113
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,763
Use your imagination.

114
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:10,301
This little shitbird, having already been
whipped good by us once...

115
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,404
he sees us, right?
And he starts crying like a little bitch...

116
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:16,303
because he knows we drove
all the way to Prince George's...

117
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,602
for more of his ass, right?

118
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,840
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room...

119
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,873
and tell him that Detective Mahone
is near dead from the sucker punch.

120
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,648
No shit. The drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma.

121
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,517
And now the Commissioner and
Mrs. Mahone are at his bedside in the ICU.

122
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:38,062
And we've been ordered to come down here,
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar...

123
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:42,065
and drive it back to Baltimore, so it can sit
with the fucking bowling trophies...

124
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,101
behind the bar at the FOP Lodge.

125
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,296
All right? After which...

126
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,437
fucknuts stops whimpering long enough...

127
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,477
to just start giving people up, whoever.

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,774
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.

129
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,543
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

130
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,676
Little prick turns on everybody...

131
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,553
and we break the case wide open.

132
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,954
- Cool.
- Right?

133
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,569
So, from all them hand-to-hands,
nobody flipped?

134
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,417
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more weight than we do.

135
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,043
Just like all these fucking homicides.

136
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,487
Witnesses lying, witnesses paid off,
witnesses backing up on their story.

137
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,422
- Can you blame them?
- Not really.

138
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,122
Every now and then, we visit the projects.
They live there.

139
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,564
- Your man's Dee, right?
- D'Angelo, yeah.

140
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,829
This one's got a Dee as a possible shooter.

141
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,430
- This one connects.
- No way.

142
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,542
Yeah? I'm seeing it.

143
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,705
- It's Diedre Kresson, one of Keeley's cases.
- Come on, Jay, this is a college girl...

144
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,512
blown up in the kitchen
of an apartment up in Northeast.

145
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:09,348
How does this match with the rest
of the Westside mopes?

146
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,979
- They don't have cars?
- This doesn't match, Jay.

147
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,116
It does. Take a look at your office report.

148
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,024
A witness puts her
with a Dee the night she's aced.

149
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,597
How many Dees do you think
there are in the system, Jay?

150
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,687
As a street name?

151
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,528
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.

152
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,535
How many case files you got
that you're putting on Barksdale?

153
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,665
- Maybe a dozen.
- A dozen cases.

154
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,174
So, how many of those are from our squad?

155
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,669
One. Gerard Bogue.

156
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,909
One case?
Your squad's down a man for weeks, Jimmy.

157
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,952
We're gonna be humping your calls,
catching your cases...

158
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,854
hopping around like a one-legged pigtown
whore on check day, and for what?

159
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,485
So that you can have your big adventure
and solve everybody else's cases?

160
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,563
Is this what I'm hearing?

161
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,560
He's got you, Jimmy.

162
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,698
Where's the love, McNulty?
Show me some fucking love.

163
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,240
- All right.
- Attaboy. He's my son.

164
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,907
Why don't you just dump
this loser on Santangelo?

165
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,177
He's supposed to be down here
helping us, anyway.

166
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,745
I would if I could find the fucker.
Must have another job, he's gone so much.

167
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,223
- What does Daniels have to say about that?
- Nothing, I cover for him.

168
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:24,625
He was out in the wind there
all day yesterday, half the day before.

169
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,164
Man, Keeley really dogged this one.

170
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,600
Ain't nothing in here but a 24
and some crime scene photos, and this.

171
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:37,272
"Tywanda called.
N.F.D., no last name, no address.

172
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:41,606
"Claims your victim killed
after being visited by a suspect named Dee."

173
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,411
No further description.

174
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,444
There's a callback number, though.

175
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,815
So, call.

176
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,540
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

177
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,643
Disconnected.

178
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,707
"He got you, Jimmy."

179
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,912
All right, motherfucker, he got me, too.

180
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,148
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.

181
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,348
You happy now, bitch?

182
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,957
You sure about that tag, Bubs?

183
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,029
I seen the van.

184
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,396
It cleared the Court
and rolled up Amity toward Lexington.

185
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,935
Plates were reported stolen off a car parked
right here, on this block.

186
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:43,005
So you're thinking they're from
right around here?

187
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,234
Maybe.

188
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,306
Word in the Towers said
it was Omar and his crew.

189
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,075
- Omar? Who's he?
- You ain't know Omar?

190
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,348
Omar, the terror. Been ripping and robbing
out here for years now.

191
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,120
- Is he fierce?
- That nigger don't play.

192
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,388
- Got a last name?
- Just Omar.

193
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,484
He don't need no last name.

194
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,994
Who's his family?

195
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,533
You remember No-Heart Anthony?
Came up with him, they brothers.

196
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,659
No-Heart Anthony?

197
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,195
Miss Kima, do not tell me
you don't remember No-Heart Anthony.

198
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,338
Damn, girl. What town you been policing at
all these years?

199
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,245
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.

200
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,584
- Shit.
- What?

201
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,412
- I'm late for my class.
- Class?

202
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,123
- 12-14.
- 12-14?

203
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:39,956
Requesting anyone in my unit who's up
to report to Channel 13.

204
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,666
35, I got that.

205
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,036
Package be moving.

206
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,271
Avon's stuff always be good.

207
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,942
It's a sweet score?

208
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,673
It's all right.

209
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:02,217
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there, though.

210
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:07,151
I fucked up, I know, letting go your name.

211
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,852
I don't really care you shouted me out.

212
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,893
Everybody in these projects
been knowing Omar, you heard?

213
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,099
I just don't want them
coming down on you, baby-boy.

214
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:24,874
Shirley coming with her game.

215
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,880
- Every fucking day with that shit.
- Mr. Omar?

216
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,146
My check late.

217
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,635
Yo, Mike. Hook a sister up, yo.

218
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,203
So, what next, yo?

219
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,405
Got some iron.

220
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,882
Thinking about working
the flush-and-run over on the Eastside...

221
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,686
till things cool a mite.

222
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,879
That'll work.

223
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,021
- So you don't want to lay over here tonight?
- No.

224
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,825
- Sure?
- No, I'm gonna go see my mom.

225
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,289
- Keep it close.
- I hear that.

226
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,845
Who the man?

227
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,554
I gotta be somewhere first,
but I'll run him back downtown after.

228
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,656
No problem, thanks for answering.

229
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,703
- Bubbs.
- McNulty.

230
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,606
What's up?

231
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,077
You ever heard of No-Heart Anthony?

232
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:14,885
Who, Anthony Little?
1058 Argyle, Apartment 16-J.

233
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,451
He's up in Hagerstown on a robbery bit.
What about him?

234
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,682
My man.

235
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,254
Fuck y'all.

236
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,163
You know how the cracker motherfuckers do
when they kill a deer?

237
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,065
Or, like, when they go out
killing animals and whatnot?

238
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,900
Got them on the front of the truck...

239
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:39,704
tied up, stretched out,
so everybody could see it?

240
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,838
You feel me?

241
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:45,011
I'm serious, that's what I want.

242
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,480
I want that motherfucker on display.

243
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,714
I'm gonna send a message
to the courtyard about this motherfucker...

244
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,483
so people know we ain't playing.

245
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,922
Yeah, we got people on it.

246
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,690
You tell them it's $1,000 on the bucks...

247
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,320
and it's $2,000 on Omar.

248
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,964
- Yeah, Bird's on it.
- Savino, too.

249
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,532
You know, Bird jailed
with Omar down the cut, right?

250
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,739
He said he all a faggot.

251
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,138
A faggot? Get the fuck out of here.

252
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,939
Yeah, said he had a whole
stable of boys down in Jessup.

253
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,845
This punk motherfucker got even less use
for pussy now that he home.

254
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:20,611
So, he gotta a lotta heart for a cocksucker?

255
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,587
Yo, we doubling down
on Sweet Lips, all right?

256
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,248
We make it motherfucking $4,000 on him...

257
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,957
$6,000 if I get the chance to
holler at him before he get got.

258
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,656
- Say no more.
- Take care of all that.

259
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,296
Stickup come up dead
on the stash one night.

260
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,833
- Police jumping out the next.
- Something up at the Pit?

261
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,099
Maybe, yeah.

262
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,906
- What's up with my nephew?
- I don't know. He doing good.

263
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,414
He making that money out the hole, but...

264
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,110
he might have a problem
he don't know about.

265
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,490
I'm on him.

266
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,533
Yo, where in
Leave it to Beaver-land are you taking me?

267
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:13,968
I'm late for something.

268
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,802
I'll drop you after,
on the way back downtown.

269
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:19,266
- What you late for?
- Soccer.

270
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,636
Suck what?

271
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,992
Get in the goal!

272
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,487
Spread it out, spread it out, there you go.

273
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,775
First team, fall in!

274
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,808
- Dad!
- Mikey, how are you?

275
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,909
- Who's winning?
- They are, 4-1.

276
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,886
4-1? Who got the goal for you guys?

277
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,390
- Ricardo, my assist.
- Assist? That's good.

278
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,657
You've got to drink on the breaks, okay?
I don't want you to get dehydrated.

279
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,460
- Hi.
- Hey.

280
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,734
This is Bubbles.

281
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,371
- Hi.
- Second team, come on!

282
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,498
- Go on, Mike, go get 'em.
- Bye, Dad.

283
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,507
You're late. He thought you weren't
gonna come this time either.

284
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,140
This job, you know this job.

285
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:36,611
I can't get out here
when he gets off the bus at 4:00.

286
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,952
I need more than every other weekend.
He needs me more, so does Sean.

287
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,889
I'm not giving up any more weekends.

288
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,393
50-50 split's all my lawyer says
I have to give...

289
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,226
It's not 50-50 if I don't
see him all goddamn week.

290
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,199
- You see him every day...
- Don't curse at me. My lawyer says...

291
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,791
Fuck your lawyer.

292
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,834
Fuck you.

293
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,605
- Did you see?
- Yeah, I saw.

294
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,150
Come on, you get out.

295
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,963
This good for you?

296
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,070
Thin line between heaven and here.

297
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,578
How did he know where the stash at?
The knockos don't know, but he do.

298
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,115
Because some nigger's snitching.

299
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,118
Man, ain't nobody got to be snitching
for Omar or his boys...

300
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,279
to creep by and see where the stash at.

301
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,853
- Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
- They stomped his ass.

302
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,929
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?

303
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,590
Boy, how you get home so quick?

304
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,096
- Nigger, what you steal?
- Camry XLE.

305
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,073
You all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.

306
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:41,641
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.

307
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,512
I'm just too bad for that off-brand
little-boy bullshit, man.

308
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,209
It can't hold me.

309
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,882
What you laughing at? What's so funny?

310
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,827
If you was me,
your ass would still be down there.

311
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,063
You ever seen a city jail, nigger?

312
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,100
You ever caught a body?

313
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,694
I'm the one who just got home, remember?

314
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,238
Eight months over on Eager Street
with a body on me.

315
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,773
- Yeah, you got the one.
- Yeah, the one you know about.

316
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,571
You little motherfuckers need to ask around.

317
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,477
Yo, out near the county, right,
on the high end of the Eastside?

318
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,679
They got these apartments, out there, right?

319
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,420
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.

320
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,821
She was, like...

321
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,262
I ain't seen a female that fine since.

322
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,433
I gotta say, Shorty was right.

323
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,031
You fucked her?

324
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,037
No, man, it wasn't like that.

325
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,699
This was a shorty
my uncle was messing with.

326
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,509
They was going on at it for a little while...

327
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,103
till she find out that my uncle got another
little shorty round the way.

328
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,775
More right to say he got a few of them
around the way...

329
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,249
know what I'm saying?

330
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,786
So, she goes off the hook,
talking about calling the police...

331
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,618
about shit she ain't supposed to know.

332
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,954
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, you know it.

333
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:07,125
But see, I got some creep to me,
and my uncle, he know that shit.

334
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,625
So they roll me out past her crib.

335
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,438
And they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor, first level.

336
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,237
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.

337
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,271
I got the .45 on me, the big gun.

338
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,311
I walk up to the window and I look in,
and it's dark as shit...

339
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,047
because it's 3:00 a.m.,
and you can't see shit.

340
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,023
What did you do?

341
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,123
So I pulled out the piece...

342
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,357
and I start tapping with the back of it
on the window.

343
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,163
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough
so she can hear that shit.

344
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:53,072
That's what she heard, yo.
Sure enough, she comes out.

345
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,276
She's naked and shit.

346
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,938
I don't know why the fuck,
but she has a robe...

347
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,542
and as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light...

348
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,487
and when she does that,
and it's light on the inside...

349
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,649
she can't see shit on the outside.

350
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,888
Damn, she naked.

351
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,201
She hears that shit on the window
and she ain't got no choice...

352
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,897
but to walk over there and see what it is.

353
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,229
She steps up...

354
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,668
looks out...

355
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,267
see where it's coming from.

356
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,844
What happened?

357
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,514
He shot her.

358
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:46,859
Yo, Dee, if she was all that,
why didn't you fuck her first?

359
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,330
- Nigger, you sick, just shut up.
- What? I'm just saying...

360
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,426
There is something seriously wrong.

361
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,541
This is ridiculous.

362
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,682
Because a lab freezer goes out
with an electrical short...

363
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,581
blood samples in 56 homicides...

364
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,354
15 rapes, are allowed to putrefy.

365
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,388
- State's attorney knows?
- The mayor, too.

366
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:21,163
Most of our trace lab is now 25 years old.

367
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,867
You ever go outside for money?
The non-profits?

368
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,037
Such as?

369
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,630
The Abell Foundation, for one.
My brother's on the board.

370
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:33,505
If you want me to run it up there for you...

371
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:37,206
- You could swing that?
- Never hurts to ask, does it?

372
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,517
It never does, Your Honor.

373
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,319
So, in that same spirit...

374
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,189
where are we with the Barksdale probe?

375
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,050
My other reason for stopping by.

376
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:00,662
Hand-to-hands and search-and-seizures,
I've heard about these.

377
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,466
Some mid-level players caught up,
as you can see.

378
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:08,045
Look, it's not a knockout blow,
but we sent a clear message.

379
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,549
I don't see Barksdale's name anywhere...

380
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,743
or Bell, or anything about the murders.

381
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,312
The casework, it goes towards that.

382
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,446
No.

383
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:23,824
So, we've got work to do, don't we?

384
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,668
Police, open the damn door!

385
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,542
- What?
- Open the motherfucking door!

386
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,293
- Upstairs front clear.
- Kitchen's clear.

387
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,220
I'm at the backdoor.

388
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:04,089
- Anybody pop out here?
- Okay, quiet.

389
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:06,833
Upstairs rear, clear.

390
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,105
I'm gonna beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild...

391
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,176
for hiding up in this pisshole.

392
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,909
Goddamn creepy crawlers everywhere.

393
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,277
Tell Bodie we're on his ass.

394
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,196
I'm sorry for cursing at the door.

395
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,292
I mean, I couldn't see that it was only you.

396
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,402
Is it the drugs again?

397
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,566
Would you like to sit down?

398
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,611
Preston came to me when my daughter died.

399
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,178
He was four years old.

400
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:58,718
But even then, I knew he was angry.

401
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,821
His mother lived out there, caught up in it.

402
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,757
After a while, you couldn't make her
see nothin' else.

403
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,662
No, man, that wasn't us.

404
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,996
2:30 in the towers?
You guys are crazy, man.

405
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,265
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

406
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,771
So, how you think you gonna carry it?

407
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,902
I'm sorry, ma'am.

408
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,105
And I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.

409
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,716
If Preston comes past...

410
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,585
give him this...

411
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,920
and tell him we need to talk, okay?

412
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,154
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,203
What the fuck you doing in there?

414
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,295
Talking.

415
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,298
- Talking?
- Yeah.

416
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,516
- See you later.
- All right, catch you later.

417
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,879
I'm driving.

418
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,337
Yeah?

419
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,346
McNulty.

420
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,978
Some judge for you.

421
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,585
Yeah?

422
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,752
Look, can I call you back?

423
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,634
- Major, sir?
- Yeah.

424
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,873
I've been thinkin'.

425
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,372
It's a clear violation of the general orders,
I know, but...

426
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,621
Last night, I'm at home,
I'm sittin' up buck naked.

427
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:17,785
And I got one hand wrapped around
a cold domestic beer...

428
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,896
and the other wrapped around
my magnificent, flaccid...

429
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:25,628
four-and-one-half inch wonder,
and I am trying with all my might...

430
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:29,433
to remember what Leila Kaufman's nipples
looked like...

431
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,135
when her bathing top slipped off
at the Hillendale pool swim party.

432
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,804
- Leila Kaufman?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,606
Summer of '72.

434
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,475
I got this saucy wench
in my gun-sights, so to speak...

435
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,414
and I am dangerously...

436
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,422
close to engorged...

437
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,964
when all of a fuckin' sudden,
out of fuckin' nowhere...

438
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,324
fuckin' Detective, fuckin' Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.

439
00:33:58,803 --> 00:33:59,827
McNulty?

440
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,336
Obviously, I gotta open my eyes
and admit to myself...

441
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,839
that my whole night is ruined.

442
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,205
At which point, I got nothing to do...

443
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,772
but think about the problems
of Jimmy McNulty.

444
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,143
Because, clearly, this guy...

445
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:15,581
and his fuckin' problems are standing
between me and all worldly pleasure.

446
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:16,878
Clearly.

447
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,622
First of all, it's not Jimmy's fault.

448
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,350
- No?
- No.

449
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,995
Jimmy is an addict, sir.

450
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,888
What's he addicted to?

451
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,161
Himself.

452
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,663
It's not funny, sir.

453
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,968
As a matter of fact,
it's a fuckin' tragedy is what it is.

454
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,536
The guy, he has come to believe...

455
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,339
that he is always the smartest fuck
in the room.

456
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:46,047
And you know what? It's not his fault,
because let's face it...

457
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,778
he's not going to Johns Hopkins
or joining Mensa...

458
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,219
he's taking a fuckin' job
with the Baltimore Police Department.

459
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,520
His first two years in Homicide,
he's in Ulmansky's squad...

460
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,491
partnered with Tony Lamartino.

461
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,530
Christ, it must've been months even...

462
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,157
he was the smartest fuck
in the fuckin' room.

463
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,860
What's your point, Jay?

464
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:07,770
My point is...

465
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,201
he can't help it.

466
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,907
It makes him an asshole, I know...

467
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,742
but it's also what makes him good police.

468
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,811
Last year, he gives me eight clearances.

469
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,050
One of them was a decomp floater...

470
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,193
who was John Doe for three weeks.

471
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,533
Tell your boy to wrap up that bullshit detail
in two weeks.

472
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,340
He does that, he comes home, clean slate.

473
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,023
You would've loved it.

474
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,656
Burrell is sittin' across from me
with a handful of street-level arrests...

475
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,563
pretendin' he has a plan.

476
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,429
So, what did you tell him?

477
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,994
"Never shit a shitter, Deputy."
That's what I fuckin' told him.

478
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,502
- I did good, right, Jimmy?
- I gotta go.

479
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,014
"Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation...

480
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:37,525
"of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition...

481
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,859
"of criminal cases within
a modern court system."

482
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,025
What?

483
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,758
That's what I said.

484
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,096
"What?"

485
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,797
What the hell's the Hicks ruling?

486
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,273
Did you highlight my sofa?

487
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,135
What? No.

488
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,974
Yes, you did.

489
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,009
That was there from before.

490
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,879
Hell it was.
Damn, Kima, marker does not come out.

491
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,682
- No, I didn't do it, I swear.
- Okay, let me see the marker.

492
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,314
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.

493
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,491
I'm serious, I need to see
some probable cause.

494
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:14,325
I'm gonna beat your ass.
How about that for probable cause?

495
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:18,925
- Give me the marker.
- Damn, gettin' all violent and shit.

496
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,796
You know you just violated my civil rights?

497
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,965
That's it, new rule: no marker on the couch.

498
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,736
You get over to that table over there
and do your homework.

499
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,779
Go. Take it and go.

500
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,677
Gimme my marker.

501
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,261
I'm gonna need some club soda.

502
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:51,733
Damn, girl, this cell phone bill
must eat up the paycheck.

503
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,827
No, most of that's work,
it's on the company.

504
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,714
Phelan won't let go.

505
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,712
Are we anywhere close on Barksdale?

506
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,113
- No, sir.
- So, what are you telling me?

507
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,984
I'm not telling you anything, sir.
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

508
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,622
I can do whatever
you need me to do with this.

509
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,254
If you want me to push it further,
I can do that.

510
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,230
If you want it to go away...

511
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,999
If you wanna bring in someone else,
maybe do things differently.

512
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,577
You looking for the back door, Lieutenant?

513
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:35,934
Already?

514
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,046
McNulty says this case needs a wire.

515
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,675
You think he's right?

516
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,251
It needs somethin'.

517
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,194
Just climb your ass up the pole, man.

518
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,966
No, man. This'll work.

519
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,867
I'm not climbin' no damn ladder.

520
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,149
You never gonna hit it, man.

521
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,342
Bomb!

522
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:17,042
- Housing must think we just dumb.
- Is that...

523
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,755
- That's your pager or mine?
- That's me.

524
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,659
- Yo, watch that shit on my head.
- Man, it ricocheted off the fuckin' camera.

525
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,890
Yeah, you need some aim.

526
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:48,841
Yo, who this?

527
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,165
So, what do you think?

528
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,602
Title 3?

529
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:17,279
Right, but it's not for a wiretap.
It's to clone a pager, I got it from Pearlman.

530
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,612
- Pagers?
- Some kind of throwback thing.

531
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:24,912
- You mean, why not cell phones?
- Right. Who uses pagers anymore?

532
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,048
Tell you what, I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.

533
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,554
Every incoming call was listed.

534
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,030
Right. So, if we get Barksdale's pager,
we might get off the street.

535
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,998
Maybe even trace some supply.

536
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,507
So, who's No-Heart Anthony?

537
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,138
No-Heart ran drugs in the homes
in the early '90s.

538
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,110
So, a couple years back, I don't know why...

539
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,741
he finds himself in Randallstown,
tryin' to take off a jewelry store.

540
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,378
He fucks it up, half the county
chases him back downtown.

541
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,684
And I guess No-Heart figures
he's not up for doing the time...

542
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,158
'cause he puts a .44 against his chest,
pulls the trigger.

543
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,523
A .44?

544
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,287
It's a contact wound.

545
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,563
Wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.

546
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,301
- With a new nickname.
- Right.

547
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,137
Bubbles says it's Anthony's brother...

548
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,134
who took off with the Barksdale stash
the other night.

549
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,836
Dude named Omar.

550
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:27,110
It's not the easiest trade, you know,
robbin' dealers.

551
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:32,182
Man like that is likely to have
a weapon on him.

552
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,052
We jack him up, there's a charge to work off.

553
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:38,288
And if he knows where
the Barksdale stash is...

554
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,123
he probably knows a whole lot more.

555
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:44,095
See? Another plan.

556
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,643
The thing is, we're gonna have to sell this.

557
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,450
You wanna raise it with Daniels?

558
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,855
He'll listen to you more than me.

559
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:16,064
Where's Santangelo?

560
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,428
He's at ECU. He's got a case going today.

561
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,038
As of today, I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...

562
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,638
we're gonna press on.

563
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,639
Ideas?

564
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,383
We could continue with the busts.

565
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,155
But I don't think that's gonna
get us too far off the street.

566
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,488
On the other hand, the people we pulled in
last week had pagers.

567
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,586
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.

568
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,359
We could clone a couple of pagers,
see where that takes us.

569
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,661
- Clone what?
- Their pagers.

570
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,305
They get beeped, we get beeped.
We see who's calling, from what number.

571
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,965
If they're all that,
why are they still using pagers?

572
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,601
Why not un-ass a few dollars
for cell phones?

573
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,610
It's a discipline.

574
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,778
You can't bug a pager.

575
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,218
But you can't make a call
with a pager, either.

576
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:14,984
You're gonna want a pen register
on all the payphones in the low-rises...

577
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,617
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.

578
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:20,424
What would it take to do the pagers?

579
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,157
A wiretap affidavit.

580
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,426
I think we got enough PC
from the hand-to-hands and surveillance.

581
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:26,735
We got most of the exhaustion.

582
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm exhausted just listening to this shit.

583
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:33,574
Good. Exhaustion is a legal requirement
for using electronic intercepts.

584
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,141
We gotta prove nothing else works.

585
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,147
See, we did the raids, we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.

586
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,241
We don't have an informant
who takes us anywhere above the street.

587
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:43,552
That's pretty much exhaustion.

588
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,214
All we got left to do now
is follow one of these mopes...

589
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,052
and prove to ourselves we can't do it.

590
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,251
We try to show a judge we can't make...

591
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,419
the case by following these guys,
and we can't.

592
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,929
How can we keep on any of them
when they're in those towers?

593
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,556
But you gotta show you tried.

594
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:02,935
Do we have a pager number?

595
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,312
This was written on the stash house wall...

596
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,848
with the letter "D" next to it.

597
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,014
Is that D'Angelo? Did you check it?

598
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,052
It's him.

599
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:37,903
Let's do this.

600
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,478
What does he want us to do?
I don't understand.

601
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,713
I'll explain it to you if you buy me breakfast.

602
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,598
Will you explain to me again...

603
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,999
why I'm about to rework
a six-month-old crime scene?

604
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,039
Look at this narrow-ass file.
Keeley didn't do shit on this.

605
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,140
He did the scene, though.

606
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,675
This is Keeley we're talking about.

607
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,835
Fucking Jay and his leaps of logic.

608
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,970
This case is nowhere near
anything we're doing.

609
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,843
So? Give it a shake or two anyhow.

610
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,008
- Make a sergeant happy.
- Whatever.

611
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:23,882
Do you know Lester Freamon?

612
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,281
A little. Why?

613
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,449
He's with us on this Barksdale thing.

614
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:30,219
I thought you said they gave you humps.

615
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:35,026
He looks like a hump, he acts like a hump,
sittin' there, playing with his toy furniture.

616
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:39,027
Jimmy, he makes more money off of
that shit than you do off of this job.

617
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,434
- Don't let Lester fool you.
- He did already.

618
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,301
Today in roll call, he showed something.

619
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,773
Hey, he's natural police.

620
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,601
He used to be Homicide.

621
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,109
- Why did he leave?
- Ask him.

622
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:56,410
- This is the one?
- Yup. Hasn't been rented since.

623
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,200
Fuck.

624
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:16,271
Motherfucker.

625
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,175
Fucking fuck.

626
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,418
Fuck.

627
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,423
Fuck.

628
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,560
What the fuck?

629
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:57,940
Fuck.

630
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,412
Fuck.

631
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,781
- No.
- Fuck.

632
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:48,055
Fuck it.

633
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,459
Fuck.

634
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,638
Motherfuck.

635
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,175
Fuck.

636
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:25,696
Fuckity, fuck, fuck.

637
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:30,797
Fuck.

638
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:32,966
Fuck.

639
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,012
Motherfucker.

640
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,827
Fuckin' A.

641
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:09,503
Fuck.

642
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:22,821
Check this.

643
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,126
Motherfucker.

644
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,595
Fuck me.

645
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,002
Sydnor's on foot, Carv's in the car...

646
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,744
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof behind Amity.

647
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,407
Again, I get the shit detail?

648
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,505
The plan is to stay on D'Angelo.

649
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,617
If we lose him, we lose him, right?

650
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,947
We're gonna lose him.

651
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,645
You can't follow people in the towers.

652
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,280
You can't hang in the low-rises
unless you got a reason.

653
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,121
Just to make sure,
we want to lose him, right?

654
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,785
Losin' him is good?

655
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,620
Right.

656
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,626
Then why the fuck do this?

657
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:13,264
Come on, Herc.
Roll with me on this one, all right?

658
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,606
So, you're police after all.

659
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,254
You know what you doing,
but you ain't been doing it.

660
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,183
How long you been in the Pawnshop unit?

661
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,723
13 years and four months.

662
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,850
- 13 years?
- And four months.

663
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,595
I gotta ask you...

664
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:43,192
what exactly does a police officer assigned
to the Pawnshop unit do?

665
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,358
You intake reports
from registered pawnshops...

666
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:47,436
on all items valued over $50.

667
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,765
Then you make an index card for that item.

668
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,534
Then you file that index card.

669
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,542
If someone wants to find out
if something stolen was pawned...

670
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,941
we see if we have an index card.

671
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:57,706
If we do, we do, if we don't, we don't.

672
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,044
- You did that for 13 years?
- And four months.

673
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,447
Why'd you ask out of Homicide?

674
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,677
Wasn't no ask about it.

675
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,117
You got the boot?

676
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,549
What'd you do to piss them off?

677
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,883
Police work.

678
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,790
I think I need to buy you a drink.

679
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,288
Just one?

680
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:17,996
Caught this case in a Brooklyn home
in the summer of '87.

681
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,433
80-year-old woman, stabbed up...

682
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,473
nightgown, in bed,
forced window, rear entry.

683
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,841
Worked it for a couple of weeks.

684
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,537
Got the names of two squirrels
over in Curtis Bay.

685
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,011
Squirrel number one gives it up...

686
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,878
and tries to put all the weight
on squirrel number two.

687
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,314
Back up the statements?

688
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,409
Print it on the rear window for number two...

689
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,681
another one for number one
on the medicine chest.

690
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,256
So, it's down, yeah?

691
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:45,690
Even better when squirrel number one
drives it by the house...

692
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,387
where they fenced the old lady's shit:

693
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,692
clock-radio, TV, toaster oven.

694
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:52,225
So, what's the problem?

695
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,369
The problem is the fence.

696
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,868
Turned out he was the son
of one of the big editors...

697
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,497
over at the News America.

698
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,542
This man is running
the afternoon newspaper...

699
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:02,304
and his son is getting all fucked up...

700
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,381
doin' the dirt and getting high
down in Locust Point.

701
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,716
The deputy, who I guess
is in a favor-doin' mood...

702
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,080
sends word down to the major...

703
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:13,485
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.

704
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,589
Just the print hits and the statement.
Play it like that.

705
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,854
So, he's doin' this for what?

706
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,759
To have some newspaper guy in his pocket?

707
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,593
Yeah, I guess so.

708
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,332
Is this Burrell?

709
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:29,638
No, no, Mueller. Deputy Ops before Burrell.

710
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,274
So, what did you do?

711
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,872
What do you think I did?

712
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,839
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.

713
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:42,714
You could've made the case without him.
Just on the prints and the statements.

714
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,753
Probably, yup.

715
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,448
Why didn't you?

716
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,189
Why?

717
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,556
Why are you fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?

718
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,436
A week after trial ends, Major comes to me...

719
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,302
asks me where I want to go.

720
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,435
I tell him, I don't care,
I like to be outside, you know?

721
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,745
Give me a goddamn foot-post...

722
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:11,370
I'll still make my money, you know...

723
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,972
send my ass up to Edmondson Avenue,
I don't give a shit.

724
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,345
You went to a foot-post?

725
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:18,420
Major come back,
asks me where I don't want to go.

726
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,091
And he asks it like
he wanna make sure I land okay.

727
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,826
So, I tell him, I don't want
no fuckin' paper-shuffle.

728
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,529
No office shit.

729
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,558
Send my black ass outside
and let me police somewhere.

730
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,066
Pawnshop unit.

731
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,798
They got me good.

732
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,268
So, why'd they let you out of the box?
Why now?

733
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,642
I guess they just forgot about me.

734
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,843
Shit, Lester.

735
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,909
You back from the dead?

736
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,950
You rolled away the stone.

737
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:56,457
Bunk Moreland says you're natural police.
One of the few.

738
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,695
Yeah, I've had my moments.

739
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,230
Detective...

740
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,568
when they ask you where you wanna go...

741
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:12,465
and they are gonna ask you
where you wanna go...

742
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,440
do yourself a favor...

743
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,379
keep your mouth shut.

744
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:22,313
I gotta take a tinkle, boy.

745
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,954
- I got it.
- All right.

746
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,196
Hello.

747
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,137
- Is Kima there?
- And you are?

748
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:50,205
Tell her it's McNulty.

749
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:04,392
For you, Kima,
a decidedly confused white boy.

750
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,256
God.

751
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,368
How'd it go today?

752
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,472
Lost him in the 221.

753
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,446
Picked him back up in the low-rises...

754
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,178
and then lost him
on Schroeder Street after dark.

755
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,719
Nicely done.

756
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,352
- Are you okay to drive?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

757
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,156
I just wanted to thank you.

758
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:41,952
For what?

759
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,966
For today, you know, with Daniels.

760
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,560
- You should be thanking Lester.
- I did.

761
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,936
I just wanted to thank you, too,
Detective Greggs.

762
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:57,775
No problem. Good night.

763
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,541
That it is.

764
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,353
What'd I miss?

765
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,594
Nothin' much.

766
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,359
Lovelorn?

767
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:17,622
Worse. Lonely.

768
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,838
You didn't make it into class again today.

769
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,799
You said you'd stick with it.

770
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,241
I'm tryin'.

771
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,080
Things are hot right now.

772
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,543
I'm doing the best I can.

773
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,215
You said yourself,
you need to do somethin' else.

774
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,450
Somethin' better for us.

775
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,283
You promised.

776
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,487
Man.

777
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,400
What am I gonna do with you?

778
00:57:56,672 --> 00:58:01,109
You know better women than you
have fallen for my tricks, right?

779
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,886
What have you got under this?
