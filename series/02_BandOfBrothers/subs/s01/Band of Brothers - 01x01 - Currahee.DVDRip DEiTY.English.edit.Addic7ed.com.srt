1
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,710
We were in a store
and a guy in that store

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,413
told us to put
our uniforms on.

3
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,682
"What the hell are
you talking about?"

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,944
He says...

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,218
the USA is in
a war with Japan.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,856
We couldn't
believe it.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,592
Well, our country
was attacked.

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,626
It's different.

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,962
It wasn't like
Korea or Vietnam.

10
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:29,963
We was attacked.

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,455
And, you know,
it was a feeling that...

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,970
Maybe, we're just
Dumb country people but,

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,240
Where I come from, but,
a lot of us volunteered.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,409
Who would like to volunteer
for the Tank Corps?

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,978
Who would like to volunteer
for the Air Force?

16
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:49,049
Who would like to volunteer
for the Navy or whatever?

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,283
and then, they said,

18
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,852
"who would like to volunteer
for the Airborne?"

19
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,422
Somebody says, "what the
hell's the Airborne?"

20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,023
Nobody ever heard of it.

21
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,992
We came from
a small, small town

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,163
And three fellas in that town
were, that were "4F",

23
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,833
committed suicide
because they couldn't go,

24
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,630
a different time.

25
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,270
I did things.

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,005
I didn't do 'em
for medals,

27
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:12,939
I didn't do 'em
for accolades.

28
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,342
I did 'em because
it's what had to be done.

29
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,178
The guy says, "Would you
jump out of airplanes?"

30
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,447
"You know, you got
all your army equipment

31
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,383
And you jump out of airplanes,
to fight the enemy."

32
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,885
These guys, they said,
"Go to hell".

33
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,786
Nobody put up
their hands.

34
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,389
And then, I don't know
what it was brought it up,

35
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,958
But the guy giving
the speech was saying,

36
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,594
"But you get paid
$50 a month more."

37
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,620
So, that made it
a hundred bucks.

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,829
( hattering )

39
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,076
( male )
I want a whiff
of chicken pie.

40
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,240
( male )
Okay, boys, let's
get this gear stowed.

41
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,032
Fox Company,

42
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,926
We go in five.

43
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:17,273
In the name of the Father
and the Son and of the Holy...

44
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,889
( male )
1st Platoon
draw small arms.

45
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,824
Do you need a hand,
Lieutenant?

46
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
( male )
"Easy Company!"

47
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,159
Listen up!

48
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,230
Gather up around me.

49
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,324
Just move it up,
C'mon, Gentlemen.

50
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,463
Let's go!

51
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,242
Now, the channel coast is
socked in with rain and fog.

52
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,578
High winds on
the drop zone.

53
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,341
No jump tonight.

54
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,749
The invasion
has been postponed.

55
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,547
We're on a twenty-four
hour stand-down.

56
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,686
Son of a bitch.

57
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,382
Drill sergeants,
Take charge.

58
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,990
Well, this is
quite a surprise.

59
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,728
Not particularly.

60
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,891
It so happens
I rather expected it

61
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,991
Well, I can't
see how you people
can pass up $80,000

62
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,795
for the cause.

63
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,473
For whose cause?

64
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,309
If you're so interested
in serving a cause,

65
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,644
why don't you
join the army?

66
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,508
