00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,551
Yeah, 'course I remember.

3
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:19,762
Not too long ago?

4
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,843
Ten years is nothin'.
I remember everything.

5
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,977
- Well, we can't know.
- _

6
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,463
_

7
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,642
I mean,

8
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:32,912
what you don't remember,

9
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,258
you don't know you don't remember.

10
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:38,386
That's some education in
semantics you're givin' me.

11
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:42,468
Hey, let's skip the deposition

12
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,011
and I can just take
notes on your lecture.

13
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,718
I brought my case file.

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,051
Thanks for comin' in,
Wayne. It's good to see you.

15
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,428
- Alan.
- How's the job?

16
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,219
Still there.

17
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,468
No major cases, but...

18
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,468
get more time with the wife and kids.

19
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,801
That's good, I guess.

20
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,593
I take time off, inside three days,

21
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,760
my wife tells me, "Get back to work."

22
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:13,092
Well, Detective Hays,

23
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:16,967
we need you to go back over
the Purcell case. Cases.

24
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,887
Lookin' to overturn
the conviction, right?

25
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,551
You good with that?

26
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,676
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

27
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:30,094
Why contest it now? Ten
years after the fact?

28
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,084
It's the family doin'
it, I know. But why?

29
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:39,092
You're having memory problems, right?

30
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,635
What?

31
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,092
You're having memory problems.

32
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,345
Don't whine about it.

33
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,801
Today's May 20th, 2015.

34
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:52,718
Henry's comin' with
the people from the TV.

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,468
You don't like the questions,
or you don't wanna do it,

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,760
Henry'll tell 'em to go screw.

37
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,509
But remember why you're talkin' to 'em.

38
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,926
Figure out how much they know.

39
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,676
You don't need no surprises
this late in the game.

40
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:11,843
I'm recordin' this on the 19th.

41
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,718
Today's the 20th. Look at your pictures.

42
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Take notes. Remember.

43
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:22,969
Remember the nightstand
if you... if you need it.

44
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,967
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

45
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,845
They're all set when you're ready.

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,054
Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:54,508
I think it's a strong case.

48
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,720
You're paid to think that, right?

49
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,885
My wife's publishing a book about it.

50
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,760
Maybe she could help you.

51
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,885
Let's get through this first.

52
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:09,468
Could you tell us about
November 7th, 1980?

53
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,553
Your timeline of events.

54
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,386
Sure.

55
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,428

56
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,926

57
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:34,887

And what were you doing that evening?

93
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:12,134
I was with my partner at the time.

94
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,011
Roland West.

95
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,468
We were doin' our regular shift.

96
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,136
Following up on a series
of thefts, I believe.

97
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,013
Workin' cases.

98
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:29,301
You'll get him next time.

99
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:34,217
Fate spared its shitty rat
life, and it has no clue.

100
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,803
Another way of sayin'
you're slow on the draw.

101
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,511
Steve McQueen died today.

102
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:05,175
We should do somethin'.

103
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,384
We could go to Miss Minnie's.

104
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:10,760
Give me a break. I
can't pay for it, man.

105
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:14,009
It's more honest than
most relationships.

106
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,386
You never bought no Saigon
trim while you was over there?

107
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,134
Guess I'm a romantic.

108
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,676
I'm a feminist.

109
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:27,009
They want to sell me a piece
of ass, they got the right.

110
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:30,803
Shit. You're gonna pay
for it one way or another.

111
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,511
You see yourself
gettin' married, Purple?

112
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,217
No, sir.

113
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,928
I'm not a big enough asshole

114
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,097
to put a woman and
children through that.

115
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:55,219
Hey.

116
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,343
Don't.

117
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,720
Shh...

118
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,421
Dick!

119
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:14,757
Foxes are predatory vermin, son.

120
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,303
Farmers, I was little,

121
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:20,467
they gave you a dollar, you kill a fox.

122
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,709
I'll give you a dollar
for lettin' it go.

123
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:31,092
Let's go ride around.

124
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:33,219
Listen to some music.

125
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,009
All right.

126
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:39,092
Maybe we can find somebody
to beat the shit out of.

127
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,678
Boy, that'd be nice.

128
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,676
I don't think so. Let me ask him.

129
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,676
Hey, son? Ronnie?

130
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:38,635
You seen the Purcell
kids? Will and his sister?

131
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:40,051
- Were they here?
- No.

132
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,865
No, he says they haven't been by.

133
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,158
You heard from 'em at all?
Were they supposed to come by?

134
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:48,008
No. I told him he could come by
to see the new puppy sometime.

135
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,009
But he didn't say today.

136
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,009
No, Tom, I'm sorry. He
hasn't heard from 'em.

137
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,511
Yeah, he's been here all
afternoon, since school.

138
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,009
All right.

139
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,178

Tracked it for two days.

147
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:29,718
Had to make my own
muzzle-loader for the season.

148
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Why'd you kill a boar, but not a fox?

149
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:36,928
Well, you eat the boar.

150
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:41,343
I only had the one shot at him.

151
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:44,468

Hmm. Except with rats.

154
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:55,675

almost ended civilization?

155
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,760
How many?

156
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,136
I don't know. At least two.

157
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,635
I hate rats.

158
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,607
What about deer? You hunt deer?

159
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,899
Only with a bow.

160
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:11,236
Never in a stand and never with bait.

161
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,906

162
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,076

166
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:27,969
That's 5009 Shoepick Lane.

167
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:33,136
Copy. We got it. Be there in ten.

168
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:37,345
Fifteen.

169
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,521
Shoepick Lane?

170
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,563
Go towards Devil's Den.

171
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,008
You know how to get to West Finger.

172
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,509

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,760
Supposed to be home

176
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,178
They not been home

177
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,598

00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:37,343
Is this setup okay for you?

179
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:40,553
Uh, yes. This is fine.

180
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,468
So, you caught the case back in '80.

181
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,428
Uh, yes.

182
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:01,326
Big full moon that night,

183
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:02,911
and...

184
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:08,967
I remember the moon.

185
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,720
And Steve McQueen had died.

186
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,009
Will and Julie.

187
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,092
I can't find 'em anywhere.

188
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,343
We need a bunch of
people out here right now.

189
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,718
Need to be on every
street, down in the woods...

190
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,982
All right, Mr. Purcell,
slow down, please.

191
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,651
Take us through what
happened, you could,

192
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:27,487
so we can know the
right thing to do next.

193
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,092
Went ridin' their bikes. Around 4:00.

194
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,904
Supposed to be home by 5:30.

195
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,832
They were supposed to
go by a friend's house.

196
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,925
Kid says he never saw 'em.

197
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,926
Never occurred to you he might be lyin'?

198
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:46,843
'Course it did.

199
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,482
General rule is, everybody's lyin'.

200
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,634
Period.

201
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,259
First impression, though, no.

202
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,551
I did not believe he was
fabricatin', not about this.

203
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,468
"About this."

204
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,051
Yeah. I mean, I didn't...

205
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:06,845
check around if he was honest
about his overtime or his height.

206
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:13,301
What is this, really?

207
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:15,176
Y'all know something I don't?

208
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,551
Well, we don't know what you know.

209
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:21,470
So we can't really answer that.

210
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,560
I was deposed when the man's family

211
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:29,019
tried gettin' the
conviction overturned in '90.

212
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:33,383
Then worked the case
again when it was reopened.

213
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:36,926
That's when my wife published the book.

214
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,553
Wish you could've talked to her.

215
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,718
I used to think back then...

216
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,037
it was before 'Nam and after 'Nam.

217
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,326
But more it's...

218
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,146
before the Purcell case and after.

219
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,091
And it keeps comin' back.

220
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,134
Here we are.

221
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:02,887
What is it, 2015?

222
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,718
Come back again.

223
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,607
And your wife's book,
which is now, well,

224
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,933
it's considered a classic
of literary nonfiction.

225
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,553
Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,219
She did a good job.

227
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,595
She was a good...

228
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:33,676
She was a good writer.

229
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:37,593
Um, good teacher,

230
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,343
good investigator, really.

231
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,259
She was good at lots of things.

232
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:46,428
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

233
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,977
A few years back.

234
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,053
We made plans. I retired and...

235
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,529
Just got me thinkin'.

236
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,531
Phew.

237
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,700
Those kids. My kids. My wife.

238
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:25,134
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:28,011
Guess I'm just missin' her today.

240
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,568
Your wife, Mr. Purcell.

241
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,637
She expected back tonight?

242
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:40,178
I think.

243
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,618
I don't know.

244
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,641
Any chance the kids could be with her?

245
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,175
No. No, no chance.

246
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,926
Have you talked to her?

247
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:52,801
Not since this mornin'.

248
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:55,468
She waitresses down at The Sawhorse.

249
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,428
She's out with her friends
now, and I can't reach her.

250
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:01,445
Get the APB out right away.

251
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:03,529
I need as many troopers
as Highway can spare.

252
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:07,146
K-9 trackers. If State's isn't
available, check with the sheriffs.

253
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,100
We're gonna search
the fields, the woods,

254
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,760
put patrols on every street.

255
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:12,635
Hi-beams out. I wanna
light all this up.

256
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,899
Ain't you gonna call the FBI?

257
00:21:14,902 --> 00:21:16,983
That's what they do on TV.

258
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,008
Takes 72 hours, sir.

259
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,678
We don't know yet if...

260
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,843
We have to wait on that.

261
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,635
You two. Start canvassing neighbors.

262
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:29,134
Ask if they saw the
kids, anything unusual.

263
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:31,551
Any other relatives
the kids might be with?

264
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:33,779
No. No, my parents are in Shreveport,

265
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,345
and Lucy's passed.

266
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,718
Talk to Ronnie Ball. Will's friend.

267
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,593
I could take y'all
out to the playground.

268
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,967
Okay, sure.

269
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,123
Mind if we look around the house

270
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:47,676
while we wait on the other officers?

271
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,718
They're not in the fuckin' house.

272
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,051
Yes, sir, but sometimes

273
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,635
might be some kind of
clue where they went,

274
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,274
if they had other plans.

275
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,550
- What? Why would they...
- Just sayin', sir.

276
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,134
It's been known to do some good.

277
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:02,102
We have to consider all possibilities.

278
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,925
Yeah.

279
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:06,146
Whatever. Do what you want.

280
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,509
- Mr. Purcell...
- Take the house apart, you want.

281
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,235
Flip on the TV. Grab yourself a beer.

282
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:12,611
I'm goin' out to find my kids.

283
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,967
I know you want to do that, sir,

284
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:18,509
but I promise, we're
getting that handled.

285
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:20,426
We need you nearby, answering questions

286
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:22,219
or if somebody calls.

287
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,925
Oh.

288
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,593
You promise.

289
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:29,602
Huh?

290
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:33,219
Yes, sir.

291
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:37,386
Can you take us through the house?

292
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,279
Please?

293
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:15,967
That's Will's room...

294
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,595
that's Julie's.

295
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,845
That one you and your wife's?

296
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:28,470
My wife's.

297
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,120
Well, go on. Knock yourself out.

298
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:21,593
Think his wife left him, took the kids?

299
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:25,176
I mean, they ain't together.

300
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:27,178
Think you're right.

301
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,178
I hope you're right.

302
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:37,040
Expect she'll call by the
mornin' if that's the case.

303
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,760
In fact, our first thought was

304
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,343
the wife had taken off with the kids

305
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,551
and hadn't told the guy.

306
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:47,551
The marriage wasn't in a good place.

307
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,967
When'd you drop that theory?

308
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,516
About two minutes later.

309
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,092
- What the fuck is goin' on, Tom?
- Let me talk to you.

310
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,134
Listen. Come here, god damn it!

311
00:24:57,136 --> 00:25:00,301
What happened?

312
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,801
What did you do? What did you do?!

313
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:06,468
Me? Me? You're their fuckin' mother,
where were you? Where were you?!

314
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,217
I am entitled to a life! All
you had to do was watch 'em!

315
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,551
I let them ride bikes like
we done a million times.

316
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,009
Maybe if you were home and
not out lookin' for dick!

317
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:16,843
Mrs. Purcell.

318
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:19,134
I'm Wayne Hays.

319
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,576
This is Roland West.

320
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:23,343
State Police detectives.

321
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:26,176
We put an APB on your kids, we
got men comin' to search now.

322
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:28,801
Can you think of anywhere
they might have gone?

323
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:31,593
Friends or relations?

324
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:35,426
No. W-We don't have any relat...

325
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:37,551
Relatives close or nearby.

326
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:40,593
I don't... I don't understand.

327
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,551
What happened?

328
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,704
You dumbass! You piece of shit!

329
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:47,849
- You slut! You slut!
- You stupid piece of shit!

330
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:49,676
Hey!

331
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,092
You been drinkin' tonight, Mrs. Purcell?

332
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,885
What?

333
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,509
So? It's not against the law.

334
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:59,051
- I'm entitled to a life.
- Of course you are.

335
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:01,967
But you two gettin' mad isn't
helping anything right now.

336
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,843
Need to work together, with us.

337
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:06,637
Okay? For the kids.

338
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:10,470
God damn it, he's so stupid.

339
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:13,704
Everything you touch turns to shit.

340
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,552
You been runnin' me down. You
been runnin' me down for ten years.

341
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:21,259
Hey! Why don't we get some
coffee goin', all right?

342
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,303
Everybody just calm down.

343
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:30,299
I'll make the coffee.

344
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:46,579
Kids headed west down the street

345
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:48,663
goin' to a playground near the school.

346
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:51,467
I want three two-man teams
goin' through these fields

347
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,301
between the main roads.

348
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:14,217
Everybody else

349
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,967
get spotlights up and down
each one of these streets...

350
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,384
Here, here, and here.

351
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,595
Y'all start canvassing...

352
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,009
We're waitin' on dogs,

353
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:36,516
but let's get goin'.

354
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,269
Yes, sir.

355
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,587
I ain't never seen these before.

356
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,985
You sure?

357
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,343
No judgement.

358
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:53,134
I read it myself.

359
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:55,468
Yeah. So do I.

360
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,762
But these are old, and I never seen 'em.

361
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:03,843
He had these?

362
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,649
It's not unusual.

363
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:08,316
No.

364
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,111
Y'all find anything else?

365
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:14,217
No, sir.

366
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:18,134
If we could ask their mother...
maybe she could tell us

367
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,180
they have any clothes missin' or not.

368
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:21,868
Might point us if they run off.

369
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:24,216
No, I don't think
she's in shape for that.

370
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:27,259
And they didn't run
off. I'm tellin' you.

371
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:28,593
Yes, sir.

372
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,509
But it needs doin'.

373
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,553
Save us time.

374
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:02,843
I didn't see the children.

375
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,051
But I saw some older boys, teenagers,

376
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,887
in a purple Volkswagen bug.

377
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:11,843
I wasn't home until after 7:00.

378
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,967
I saw the two kids

379
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:16,217
riding out toward the park.

380
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:19,384
But I didn't see any teenagers.

381
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:22,301
But I know they hang
around at Devil's Den.

382
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:27,176
I hear things... about
what they do out there.

383
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:29,607
Yeah, sometimes, like,

384
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,801
out by the ranger tower
at the edge of the park,

385
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:35,009
people hang out, listen to music.

386
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:39,563
That Volkswagen is
Freddy Burns's, I think.

387
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:43,231
I seen that "Trash Man"
fella. I don't know his name.

388
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,134
Rides around town in a go-cart,

389
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,718
pickin' through garbage.

390
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,593
Everybody knows him.

391
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:52,176
Patty! What's that
"Trash Man" guy's name?

392
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:55,926
His last name's Woodard, I think.

393
00:30:55,928 --> 00:31:00,384
I saw him ridin' around when
I was lookin' for the kids.

394
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:04,843
He drives a go-cart and
tows this little trailer.

395
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:08,635
He picks up trash and sells
it at the scrapyard, I guess.

396
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:10,138
Been around for years.

397
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:11,926
I never liked him.

398
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:14,801
Goin' through other people's trash.

399
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,803
Any idea where he lives?

400
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:22,259
We're sorry for the personal
nature of these questions, but...

401
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:25,261
we need to know everything we can.

402
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,635
How long you folks
been sleepin' separate?

403
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,618
- Few months.
- About six months.

404
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:35,009
- Since beginning of summer.
- Hasn't been that long.

405
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:36,704
Yeah, it has. Dan left last May,

406
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:38,383
then I took the couch.

407
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:40,760
- Dan?
- He's my cousin.

408
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:42,718
Stayed with us a few weeks last spring.

409
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,467
He's like an uncle to the kids.

410
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,301
And what's his last name?

411
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:49,801
O'Brien. Same as mine... used to be.

412
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,593
Where's he live?

413
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:54,384
He's up in Springfield, Missouri.

414
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,373
But he hasn't seen the
family in a long time.

415
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,712
- He stayed there on the couch?
- No, he stayed in Will's room,

416
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,094
Will was on the couch.

417
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:11,843
Would you write down his contact info?

418
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,468
Phone number and address.

419
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,343
What for? Been gone since May.

420
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,302
Just have to check out anything we can.

421
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:22,635
Sometimes, there's tension
between the parents, or...

422
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,551
fightin' and whatnot,

423
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:27,051
kids'll make like to run away.

424
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,801
They didn't run away, god damn it.

425
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:32,509
Why don't you go find
that "Trash Man" bastard

426
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,220
and ask him some questions.

427
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:37,096
- Did you talk to Ronnie Ball?
- We did.

428
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,967
Hadn't seen Will since school.

429
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:41,468
Parents said he'd been home since 3:00.

430
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,178
But they didn't run off.

431
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:58,635
Everybody went home
to wait for daylight.

432
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:01,551
I didn't go to sleep that first night.

433
00:33:01,553 --> 00:33:04,386
I stayed out, trying to find a trail.

434
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:10,053
I was a tracker, you see.

435
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,762
I should stop.

436
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,217
Do I need to stop?

437
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:52,637
No, uh, we're okay.

438
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,009
Sorry about that.

439
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:58,259
Please continue, Mr. Hays.

440
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:00,217
Uh...

441
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:04,259
had maybe 15 guys out that first night.

442
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,782
They went home after a few hours.

443
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:08,718
Day would give us better odds.

444
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,718
Get the news to help.

445
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,967
Two children are missing

446
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,599
from a West Finger neighborhood.

447
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:16,885
Will and Julie Purcell were last seen

448
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,635
riding their bicycles
west on Turpin Road,

449
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,635
not far from Devil's Den State Park,

450
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:23,843
around 4:00 yesterday afternoon.

451
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,885
Police are calling on
volunteers to aid in the search

452
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,926
and are asking all
residents to keep an eye out

453
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:33,154
and report anything unusual
they might have noticed

454
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:35,801
or believe might be
relevant to the case.

455
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:38,217
The brother and sister are 12 and 10,

456
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,678
and attend the West
Finger school system.

457
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,676
"Tell me a story.

458
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:03,678
In this century, and moment, of mania.

459
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:07,303
Tell me a story.

460
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:13,011
Make it a story of great
distances, and starlight.

461
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,843
The name of the story will be Time,

462
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:22,301
but you must not pronounce its name.

463
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:25,887
Tell me a story of deep delight."

464
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,843
What do you think Warren means by that?

465
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:34,676
Why mustn't you say
the name of the story?

466
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:36,178
Anybody?

467
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:41,092
Riley?

468
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:44,926
I teach English, eighth
through twelfth grade.

469
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,259
Will's a student of mine, too.

470
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,593
Do you got a boy in
your class right now,

471
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,219
a senior, named Freddy Burns?

472
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:57,134
Yes. He's here today.

473
00:35:57,137 --> 00:35:58,762
We'd like to speak with him.

474
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,426
Okay.

475
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:03,386
What are you studying?

476
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,343
The quote.

477
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:11,301
Uh, it's a poem we're discussing.

478
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,887
Huh.

479
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:24,009
What?

480
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,595
"What?"

481
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:30,593
We were just hanging out, ya know?

482
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,593
Go down to the ranger
tower, mess around.

483
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:35,426
What time was that?

484
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:39,016
Um, maybe 4:30, 4:45
we got there, I think.

485
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,975
And that was you...

486
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:44,185
Ryan Peters, and this Lampanella boy?

487
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:45,843
Anybody drinkin'?

488
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:47,303
No, sir.

489
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:53,141
See on the news this mornin'...

490
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,803
about those missing kids?

491
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:59,676
These two. You recognize 'em?

492
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,136
Yeah, I seen 'em around.

493
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,051
I think we saw 'em.

494
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:07,134
You saw 'em.

495
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,009
Ridin' their bikes.

496
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:12,092
Yesterday. We passed
'em when we were drivin'.

497
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:14,259
What time was that?

498
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:17,673
Maybe 4:15? Before we got to the park.

499
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:20,217
You saw 'em riding their
bikes in the neighborhood?

500
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:21,926
Yes, sir.

501
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:24,926
Just the once? You didn't see 'em again?

502
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:28,301
- No, sir.
- And they weren't out at the tower?

503
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,718
No. No, sir.

504
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,092
What time y'all leave the park?

505
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:38,134
It was about 9:00, I
think. A little after.

506
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,969
Let me ask you.

507
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,470
What's up with this?

508
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,343
I-I mean, it's...

509
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:50,259
It's just a band.

510
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,426
Black Sabbath, huh?

511
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:54,635
What's a Black Sabbath?

512
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:57,511
It's a satanic mass.

513
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:01,843
Is that true? It's satanic?

514
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:04,511
I think it's just their name.

515
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:17,969
You see either of these
children yesterday?

516
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:23,053
- Um...
- What?

517
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,053
Yeah. Yea...

518
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:32,175
I mean, yes, sir. I...

519
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:35,343
They were... They were out
playin' in... in the park.

520
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,261
You saw 'em in the park?

521
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:43,217
Were they up at the tower
when y'all hangin' out?

522
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,345
No. I...

523
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,259
I mean, I-I don't think so.

524
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:50,774
But you don't know.

525
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,676
I don't know all the kids that
were playin' out there, ya know?

526
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,509
There were other kids out there?

527
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:58,051
Yeah. They weren't with us, um...

528
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:01,196
There were a couple kids
playin' with firecrackers

529
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,050
and younger kids just runnin' around.

530
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:05,926
We didn't talk to 'em.

531
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,637
You know any of their names?

532
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,176
No.

533
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:13,298
Anything you can tell me

534
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:15,550
about Will?

535
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,193
His friends? Family?

536
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:20,470
Any sense you might've had?

537
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:25,468
He's a good student.

538
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,637
Quiet, polite in homeroom.

539
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:32,053
He's very advanced in English.

540
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:37,051
As far as home, I don't really know.

541
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:40,009
I don't know either of his parents.

542
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,136
But he's a nice boy.

543
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,926
He has a sensitivity.

544
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:50,051
You always worry a bit
about the sensitive ones.

545
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,551
Hmm.

546
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:53,426
There's a few of the older boys here,

547
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:55,865
you know, they make
it hard on the others.

548
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:59,301
But I never saw Will
getting any trouble.

549
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:02,032
I just...

550
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:06,300
well, I don't think he got noticed much.

551
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,635
How long you been teachin'?

552
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:11,384
- About six years.
- All at West Finger?

553
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:12,649
Yes, sir.

554
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:15,133
Hey, you say "sir," I
start lookin' for my boss.

555
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:16,593
No, I'm sorry.

556
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:19,803
Just, you know. Police.

557
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:27,967
How is it here?

558
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:29,178
You know.

559
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,718
It's fine.

560
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,676
It's good, really, for what it is.

561
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,179
I hear something now and then.

562
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:43,259
They're all poor around
here. That's the main thing.

563
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,343
What you hear now and then?

564
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,426
You know...

565
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:50,053
a word in the hallway or something.

566
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:53,845
They're careful around me.

567
00:40:58,553 --> 00:41:00,926
What about these boys, um,

568
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,676
Freddy Burns, Ryan Peters,
and Jason Lampanella?

569
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:06,676
I don't know.

570
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:09,593
They're kinda their own little group.

571
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:11,843
They posture a lot,

572
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:16,051
but I'd say they're mostly outcasts.

573
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,881
Tough attitudes,

574
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:20,845
can't talk to girls...
That kind of thing.

575
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,399
And Will's good in English?

576
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,816
Reads at a twelfth grade level,

577
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,942
writes very well,

578
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:33,800
pays attention in class.

579
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:36,386
He's a bit shy about speaking up.

580
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:40,676
And, um...

581
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,219
you from this area?

582
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:45,635
Fayetteville.

583
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,967
Still live there.

584
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,760
So do I.

585
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:51,551
Nice place.

586
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:52,887
Yep.

587
00:41:57,637 --> 00:42:00,593
All right, um...

588
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:02,760
thanks very much, Miss Reardon.

589
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:05,343
Well, now you have me
looking for my mother.

590
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:07,718
Yeah, okay.

591
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,593
I'm Wayne.

592
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,368
Amelia.

593
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:12,763
Okay.

594
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,967
Think you'll find those children?

595
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,637
I've got hope.

596
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:23,842
I'll let you know if
there's anything else.

597
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:26,134
Please do.

598
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,928
Anything at all.

599
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,720
Do you have a number?

600
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,470
- I'll be in touch.
- Good.

601
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:59,176
Think they're lyin'?

602
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:03,718
I mean, they're lyin', but...

603
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,301
think it's just regular teenage lyin',

604
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:08,801
or somethin' else?

605
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,428
I don't know.

606
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,759
The one, Burns, lied about the beer.

607
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:18,426
- There's lots of reasons to do that.
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:21,509
Put a couple guys
tailin' Burns and Peters.

609
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:25,134
Hit this address up for
the trash can guy, Woodard.

610
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:28,178
Come back on the teenagers, we need to.

611
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:32,009
What about that teacher?

612
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:34,345
You gonna come back on her?

613
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,011
Uh-huh.

614
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:44,907
After the school,

615
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,117
we, uh...

616
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,185
checked out that guy
people called "Trash Man."

617
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,303
Brett Woodard.

618
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,967
Used to ride around in his go-cart

619
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,845
collectin' garbage.

620
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:05,967
He wasn't home.

621
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:09,178
Checked around his
place, the door was open.

622
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,343
Anyways,

623
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:15,261
you know what happened with him.

624
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:40,345
Think the backyard was neater.

625
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,842
A lot of guys have
trouble, they come back.

626
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:53,468
Mm-hmm.

627
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,801
I heard one of my old rodeo buddies

628
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:57,801
is on the street in Shreveport.

629
00:45:57,803 --> 00:46:01,676
There's another buddy
went to prison in Oklahoma.

630
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,303
Killed a dude in a bar fight.

631
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:08,178
You know guys like that?

632
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:12,011
Couple.

633
00:46:15,303 --> 00:46:17,553
Put an APB on this guy.

634
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,720
I'm ready to go now.

635
00:46:41,678 --> 00:46:43,926
I don't want to be here.

636
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:46,459
- I need to stop for today.
- Oh.

637
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:49,967
Um, well, we didn't really
get into the questions.

638
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:52,860
I understand if it's difficult
to discuss Mr. Woodard...

639
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:54,238
Not today.

640
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:57,753
I'm sorry.

641
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:04,301
- You all right, Pop?
- I think. I don't know.

642
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:06,762
- Can you get 'em out of here?
- Yeah, sure.

643
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,676
Wanna thank the volunteers
came out with us today.

644
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:51,762
It's a tough thing.

645
00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:56,509
Check this spot.

646
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,743
Get those fuckin' dogs away from me.

647
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:00,428
Okay.

648
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:23,762
What's your partner doin'?

649
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:27,134
He's got his own thing.

650
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:29,885
Well, how's that help us?

651
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:34,235
Man was a LRRP in 'Nam.
You know what that is?

652
00:48:34,238 --> 00:48:36,759
Long range reconnaissance.

653
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:39,801
Drop 'em in the jungle alone,

654
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:42,551
come out two or three weeks later

655
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,261
with scalps.

656
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:47,803
He's like a pathfinder.

657
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,762
Tracks wild boar for fun.

658
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:57,136
He wanna look alone, I'm okay with it.

659
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,678
Shit.

660
00:53:49,386 --> 00:53:51,134
Roland?

661
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:53,095
Copy.

662
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,918
I found the boy.

663
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:05,595
"What is love?

664
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,637
One name for it is Knowledge."

665
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,009
Dad?

666
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,384
Crew cleared out.

667
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,011
They're gone.

668
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,219
Pop?

669
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,343
There's another one of them dolls,

670
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,011
further back.

671
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:12,511
Right where the trail got sketchy.

672
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:16,118
Bag 'em all.

673
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:17,595
Okay.

674
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,593
Leadin' me.

675
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:25,011
Like a marker or somethin'.

676
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:31,553
Kid's head looked injured.

677
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:37,553
Did a little tunnel work
over there, you know?

678
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:41,887
Almost couldn't go inside.

679
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,219
All right.

680
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,149
There's no sign of the girl.

681
00:55:47,152 --> 00:55:49,567
We have to get back out
there lookin' for her.

682
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,278
Okay, man. All right. We will.

683
00:55:56,678 --> 00:55:58,885
You know what I found.

684
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:01,637
I don't need to go back over it.

685
00:56:05,136 --> 00:56:08,735
I think I'm done for the day, unless
y'all wanna tell me what's goin' on.

686
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:11,110
What's goin' on is the
wrong man ten years ago.

687
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:13,656
No shit. But tell me why.

688
00:56:16,928 --> 00:56:20,718
Okay, I'll give y'all another
20 minutes some other time,

689
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,593
and that's how we'll do this.

690
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:25,760
Maybe we'll finish up by next summer.

691
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,676
The girl... Julie.

692
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:34,134
- Alan, I don't...
- What about her?

693
00:56:34,136 --> 00:56:38,136
Her prints went into the system
when they established the database.

694
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:44,150
Okay.

695
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,587
An after-hours burglary
in Sallisaw, Oklahoma.

696
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,718
Two months ago.

697
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,468
A Walgreen's.

698
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,843
Somebody broke into the pharmacy.

699
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:56,637
PD worked the store for fingerprints.

700
00:56:58,053 --> 00:57:01,134
Only one set of prints hit.

701
00:57:01,136 --> 00:57:03,011
Julie Purcell's.

702
00:57:04,678 --> 00:57:06,760
Julie.

703
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:09,261
- She's alive?
- Apparently.

704
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,345
Jesus Christ.

705
00:57:17,678 --> 00:57:19,511
She's out there.

706
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,801
Where ya goin'?

707
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:33,678
Back out.

708
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:36,560
We have to find her.

709
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:41,376
It's too dark, man.

710
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:42,962
I don't care.

711
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,005
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

712
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:06,092
Everybody was scared. That included us.

713
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:10,693
We're gonna have to have a
curfew for a little while.

714
00:59:12,178 --> 00:59:14,635
You questioned people
during this time, right?

715
00:59:14,637 --> 00:59:16,428
Do you know another way to do it?
