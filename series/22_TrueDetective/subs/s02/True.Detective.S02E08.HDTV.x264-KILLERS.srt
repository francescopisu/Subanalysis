Trees.

37
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:52,347
That little place
in the rock

38
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,482
in the trees.

39
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,902
A cave

40
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,738
is how I remember it.

41
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,241
It's like a fairy tale.

42
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,330
Four days?

43
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,668
No, maybe he gave me
something.

44
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,372
Maybe I blocked it out.

45
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,011
It's a black hole.

46
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,679
This empty space,

47
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,599
<i>those four days.</i>

48
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,051
And what I remember
when I got...

49
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,776
I got in the car.

50
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,403
He didn't force me.

51
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:52,073
<i>He didn't even get</i>
<i>near me.</i>

52
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,294
He called me pretty.

53
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:04,919
<i>I remember.</i>

54
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,341
I remember
it made me feel...

55
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,561
I liked...

56
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,572
<i>I got in the van</i>
<i>with a stranger.</i>

57
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:31,112
<i>Every time I remember</i>

58
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:33,448
<i>that feeling,</i>

59
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,167
<i>like pride,</i>

60
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,454
<i>I get sick to my stomach.</i>

61
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,673
<i>I could lie to myself,</i>

62
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,425
but I felt proud.

63
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:47,846
I was proud
that he thought

64
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,431
I was pretty.

65
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,977
Makes me sick.

66
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:07,699
None of that
was your fault.

67
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,071
<i>I walk up behind him.</i>

68
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,825
It's him.
It's the guy.

69
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,694
I've been thinking
about him.

70
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,030
<i>I've been picturing him</i>
<i>for months.</i>

71
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:59,167
<i>I'm not sleeping.</i>

72
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,669
<i>Passing strangers</i>
<i>who was wondering.</i>

73
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,123
He turned his head

74
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,175
right as I was
up on him.

75
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,796
<i>I planned to say it...</i>

76
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,383
but I didn't say anything.

77
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:18,052
I got sick,
and to keep from being sick,

78
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:19,637
I raised up...

79
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,199
right when
he was turning.

80
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,656
And I...

81
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,998
<i>It didn't make</i>
<i>anything better.</i>

82
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,585
<i>It made it worse.</i>

83
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,723
<i>And I know now,</i>

84
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,425
you know, the act,

85
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:02,597
it described
a trajectory.

86
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,767
People...

87
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,355
whole cultures

88
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,607
<i>wouldn't blame you.</i>

89
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,994
I don't.

90
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,119
It wasn't him.

91
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,458
They got the real guy.

92
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,261
Something in Venice,
you know?

93
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,296
Weeks ago.

94
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,389
<i>Who was he?</i>

95
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,776
I don't even know
if it matters.

96
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,829
So I haven't been
like this in a long time.

97
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,550
Years.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,586
I could tell.

99
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,640
Why?

100
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:26,481
You seemed like

101
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,983
you were making up
for lost time.

102
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,498
I'd do anything
for 10 more years.

103
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,167
We should have met
when we were young.

104
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,337
We said we wouldn't
regret the past.

105
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,423
Anyway, who said we don't
have 10 more years?

106
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,894
There's 100,000 there.

107
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,979
You're gonna go
with Nails.

108
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,182
I'll meet you
in two weeks or less.

109
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:04,018
Like hell.
I'm not leaving you.

110
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,822
I know about the clubs.
I saw Blake.

111
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:10,358
- I'm not--
- You don't have a choice.

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,244
I always have a choice.

113
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:17,081
And I'm not
going anywhere.

114
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:24,839
It's not gonna work,
the you and me thing.

115
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,876
The way I see it is you
weren't up front with me.

116
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,712
If you can't have a kid, then
what good is the design, see?

117
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,848
You had me on
the fairy tale for a while,

118
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,217
and it was good,

119
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,768
but now it's time to go.

120
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,438
You can't act for shit.

121
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,606
Take it from me.

122
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,892
Where one goes, the other goes.
That's what we said.

123
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:48,979
That's not acting. Now take your
payout and get the fuck on.

124
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:00,708
Your ring?
What is that?

125
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,127
You think that I--
here.

126
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,997
You think I give
a fuck about rings?

127
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,001
- That was a big diamond.
- Fuck you.

128
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:14,088
I am not leaving you. I know
what you're doing, Frank.

129
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,807
Stop reading into things.
Listen to what I'm saying.

130
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,143
I am listening
and you're not convincing.

131
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,978
So you listen to me.

132
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Whatever they do to you,
they do to me.

133
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,933
Do you understand?
There's us.

134
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:29,854
There's us, and everything
else is in the gray.

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,606
So fuck your martyrdom.

136
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,609
I came in this with my
eyes open, same as you.

137
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,004
You have to go.

138
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:50,791
I got us new cars. Nails is
gonna watch out for you.

139
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,960
No.

140
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,962
You come with me.

141
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:57,465
100,000 is more
than enough.

142
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,468
- To start over?
- To hold on to what's ours.

143
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,269
I can't run.

144
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,939
They'll come for me
and they'll keep coming.

145
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,524
I need to finish this.

146
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,309
You can't finish this.

147
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,312
They made sure of that before
they threw the first punch.

148
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:14,198
I have a play.
One thing they don't know.

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
It's not worth it.

150
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:20,070
I cannot run.
It'll never stop.

151
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,406
If I do that
and I come home

152
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:25,075
and I find you, no.

153
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,745
No.

154
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,501
I'm not--
I'm not leaving you.

155
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:39,807
Baby, you made it all
mean something.

156
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,761
Everything before we met.

157
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,849
If they came to me
through you,

158
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,235
if they hurt you,

159
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,654
I couldn't,

160
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,240
I wouldn't
deserve to live.

161
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,692
If you love me,

162
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,328
I cannot do the things
I have to do

163
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,781
unless I know
you're safe.

164
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,866
If I don't think
you're safe,

165
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,535
I'm lost.

166
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,702
They got me.

167
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:11,372
Nails has two tickets.

168
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:14,375
Venezuela
out of Oregon.

169
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,460
Not unless you're with me.

170
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:19,046
Otherwise the last
six years are nothing.

171
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,382
No, they weren't.

172
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,467
Never nothing.

173
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,886
I know.

174
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:29,273
I know. That was
never our story.

175
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,694
I got my ticket out.

176
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll meet you inside of
two weeks, I promise.

177
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,404
Two weeks.

178
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,406
Or less.

179
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:46,624
Barquisimeto.

180
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,460
You'll meet me
in two weeks

181
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,579
or less.

182
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:53,964
El Obelisco.

183
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,549
There's a park there.

184
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,920
Wear a white dress.

185
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:06,477
You wear a white suit with
a red rose in your jacket.

186
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,598
I'll wear a red rose
in my jacket.

187
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,235
I'll see you coming
out of the crowd,

188
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,605
a head higher
than everybody else.

189
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,825
At first I'm worried.

190
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,611
I can't see you.

191
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:28,499
But then you do.

192
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,585
I see the white dress.

193
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,849
You don't have
to do that, Frank.

194
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,801
I mean the money.

195
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,720
Couldn't see.

196
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:51,138
Blood in my eyes.

197
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,857
Nail in my fucking head.

198
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,693
I heard him saying
leave me.

199
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,228
Fucking teamster.
A nail gun.

200
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,815
Slung me over your shoulder.
I don't forget that.

201
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,068
I know you don't.

202
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,823
Nobody's gonna
get near her.

203
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,792
I promise.

204
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,494
We'll see you
in two weeks.

205
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:14,745
Or less.

206
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,008
_

207
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:53,500
<i>The security camera
right down the street.</i>

208
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,035
<i>Yeah, he, uh--</i>

209
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:58,038
he worked under the prosecutor
for the AG that got murdered.

210
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,874
Excuse me.

211
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,461
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Woodrugh?

212
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,930
He's no longer with us,
I'm afraid.

213
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:09,183
<i>Hello, Ray.</i>

214
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,388
- What happened?
<i>- Why don't you tell me, Ray?</i>

215
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,192
Hmm?
Davis, Woodrugh.

216
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:19,727
It's all you, right?

217
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,397
You know I know, right?

218
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,783
<i>The robbery in '92.</i>

219
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,985
<i>Caspere kept</i>
<i>some diamonds.</i>

220
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,788
He was holding them
over you, yeah?

221
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:35,492
We should meet.
Let's talk this over.

222
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,628
You could come out
of this good, Ray.

223
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,748
I can make it go away.

224
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,468
Put you right.
Get you paid.

225
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,720
Sure.

226
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:50,841
Yeah, I'll drop by
PD later today.

227
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:54,344
Where are you?

228
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:57,014
Come on, Ray.
You're one of us.

229
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,101
Why Woodrugh?
There was no reason.

230
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:04,571
Why do you care? You know
the guy was a fag, right?

231
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,190
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you're a player, Ray.</i>

232
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,108
<i>Let's talk.</i>
<i>We can work this out.</i>

233
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,777
Yeah, sure thing,
Lieutenant.

234
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:15,032
What was that?

235
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,418
Woodrugh.

236
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,672
He's dead.

237
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,434
Who?

238
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,352
Why? What--

239
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:39,156
Jesus Christ. He was gonna
have a fucking kid.

240
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,358
It was Burris.

241
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>They're putting it</i>
<i>on me.</i>

242
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,696
First Davis, now--
fuck!

243
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:48,115
I can't-- I can't--

244
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,250
Jesus, he was--

245
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,705
after everything else.

246
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,926
Fuck.

247
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,970
He was better than us.

248
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,359
He saved our asses.

249
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,145
Twice.

250
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,482
Three times.

251
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,735
Now.

252
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,992
He deserved better.

253
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,466
Who do we have now?

254
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,587
The girl Erica,
she's in the wind.

255
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,762
There was two of them.

256
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:54,815
- The kids-- boy, girl.
- What?

257
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,017
Field interviews,
that movie set.

258
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,404
We had a crew list. There was a guy there.
Set photographer.

259
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,190
She talked to him.
The ages are right.

260
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,743
Fuck, they even
kind of looked alike.

261
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,529
Set photographer.
Lenny Tyler.

262
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,331
That's the brother.
Laura and Leonard.

263
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,450
They might have
the hard drive.

264
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,918
Caspere's hidden camera.

265
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,538
Caspere's murder,
if it was them,

266
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
it just opened up
all this other stuff.

267
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,292
We were always set up.

268
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,594
So was Frank.

269
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:24,762
Your gangster buddy.

270
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,213
Yeah, he's actually
not a bad guy,

271
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:29,183
but, yeah,
Caspere was playing him.

272
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:31,885
So we find Osterman.
Tyler.

273
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:34,221
Says here Lenny's
with the union.

274
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,190
They'd have
some kind of address.

275
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,732
Unless you just want
to take off.

276
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,037
I'm pretty sure

277
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,239
I can get us
out of the country.

278
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:57,911
If there's a chance to get
them, I want to take it.

279
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:05,252
I was never big
on running myself.

280
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,757
Woodrugh wasn't.

281
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,270
Hello.

282
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,453
<i>Austin?</i>

283
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:17,491
<i>Tony?</i>

284
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:21,745
Where is he?
Tony.

285
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,748
I don't know.

286
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,667
What-- what day is it?

287
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:31,138
- There was yelling.
- Yelling about what?

288
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,008
A Russian man.
Tony's parties.

289
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,344
His new business
or something.

290
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:38,645
Hard to remember.

291
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,764
How did you meet
Austin the mayor?

292
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,400
Tony introduced us.

293
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,820
He say his father lonely
since mother got sick.

294
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,858
But you were
Tony's friend first?

295
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,752
Shh, shh.

296
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:04,037
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

297
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,877
How did this--

298
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:12,546
I-- I don't--
he kill himself?

299
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,181
Where's the daughter Betty?

300
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:17,718
Betty?
She was there, I think.

301
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,469
With the yelling.

302
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,188
They talk about me.
I hear them.

303
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,807
She's sick
like her mother.

304
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,693
I can't believe
Austin would do this.

305
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:29,146
Are you fucking dense?

306
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:31,231
This is your boy Tony.

307
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,400
Made it look like
some half-ass suicide.

308
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,653
And my guess is you'll
be taking the fall.

309
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:39,122
Where's Tony now?
Think.

310
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,407
Where would he be?

311
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,993
I-- I don't know.
He's cold to me now.

312
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,747
Is there a safe
in the house?

313
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,632
Do you have access
to bank accounts?

314
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,167
Austin handles
those things.

315
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,502
I have allowance.

316
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,222
Then I hope you saved some
of that Miss Ukraine money.

317
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,035
<i>Len?</i>

318
00:22:56,595 --> 00:22:58,261
<i>Len?</i>

319
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,357
You?

320
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,537
<i>They split us up after.</i>

321
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,489
<i>I had a foster family,</i>

322
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,741
but Len went
into a group home.

323
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:32,579
I ran away at 16.

324
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,498
Started working
the streets.

325
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,967
How did you meet
Caspere?

326
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:39,469
Through Tascha.

327
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:41,755
She introduced
me to Tony.

328
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,174
Brought me
into the parties.

329
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:47,094
Then she told me
about his diamonds.

330
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,931
Then I met him...

331
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,434
and I knew.

332
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,237
He used to visit
my mother.

333
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:00,273
I remembered him.

334
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,112
And you got him
to hire you?

335
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:07,664
I changed my name.

336
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,583
Dyed my hair red.

337
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:12,119
He didn't recognize me
from the parties.

338
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:15,372
I started digging
into all of his stuff.

339
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:18,008
And Len,
your brother?

340
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,178
We found each other
years back.

341
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:25,966
He'd been through a lot.

342
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:29,102
The places he grew up.

343
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,472
I got him a job
on the movie set.

344
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,277
And what happened
with Caspere exactly?

345
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,229
I went to his place.

346
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,449
His other place. I left
the door unlocked.

347
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,234
Put a pill in his drink.

348
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:47,954
Len came in. He saw
inside the house.

349
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:52,492
He knew what
I'd been doing.

350
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:55,795
He went bad.

351
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:59,499
He was gonna use the
acid to get Ben to talk,

352
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,384
to tell us who else
had robbed us,

353
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:05,255
who had killed our parents,
but he got carried away.

354
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:07,474
He was too angry.

355
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:11,311
He put him
out there on the road.

356
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,346
- Why?
- I don't know.

357
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,566
I think...

358
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:20,353
he thought it was funny.

359
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:23,073
Caspere was confessing
everything.

360
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:25,108
Begging.

361
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,495
<i>He told him about</i>
<i>the rail corridor.</i>

362
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:32,365
<i>He drove around with Ben's
body through all those places.</i>

363
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,202
Why'd he leave you
like this?

364
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,506
Because I was trying
to stop them.

365
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,041
From what?

366
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:44,044
He's gonna meet up with
that chief, Holloway.

367
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,845
He's gonna trade him
the hard drive

368
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,631
from Ben's place
for the diamonds.

369
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,715
What's on the hard drive?

370
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,885
Would have been footage
of important men.

371
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:55,388
- You said would have.
- We didn't have the password.

372
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,308
And the hard drive
erased itself.

373
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,944
Some kind of
security feature.

374
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:04,231
- It's blank.
- He's going there to kill Holloway.

375
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,484
Where's he meeting
Holloway?

376
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,069
How long ago
did he leave?

377
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,738
A couple of hours. He
wanted to get there early.

378
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,823
- Where?
- The train station here.

379
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:16,910
The big new one.
He wanted a public place.

380
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:20,413
We got her testimony. You stay with her
until we can walk her into a precinct.

381
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:22,132
Ray. Ray, wait.

382
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:40,684
Saw the mayor went for a swim.
Thought I should say good-bye.

383
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:44,487
<i>What are you doing, Frank?
This was very unlike you.</i>

384
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:48,775
Lashing out, childish.
Now I have to answer.

385
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:51,778
Like I had to answer this,
you patronizing old fuck?

386
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,497
Are you still
in LA, Frank?

387
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,118
Oh, I'm long gone,
cue ball.

388
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,536
But we'll settle up later.

389
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,621
We certainly will.

390
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:05,125
Good luck with that,
you KGB kike motherfucker.

391
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll only need
the one bullet.

392
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:09,796
Maybe not today
and maybe not tomorrow,

393
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:12,215
but, Osip,
when the lights go out,

394
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:14,434
that's me.

395
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,362
Who is this?

396
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:28,982
- <i> Velcoro.</i>
- Ray.

397
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:31,484
I was just
thinking about you.

398
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,458
Where are you
taking me?

399
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,043
Me? Nowhere.

400
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,162
This bus goes
to Seattle.

401
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:44,497
Hits a couple stops
in between.

402
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:48,335
You get out of here.
Forget this.

403
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:49,803
Maybe it can
blow over for you.

404
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:53,139
This is never
gonna blow over.

405
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,008
My life ended that day.

406
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,227
Except it didn't.

407
00:27:57,229 --> 00:28:00,597
You can lay it down.
I'm giving you that.

408
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,600
Why?

409
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:07,737
Because...

410
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,272
whatever debt there was,

411
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:12,525
you're not the person who
needs to be punished now.

412
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:14,277
What about Len?

413
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,366
Lay him to rest.

414
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,584
Sounds like you
lost him years ago.

415
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:26,956
What am I supposed to do?

416
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,878
I don't know.

417
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:08,965
Nobody is here right now.

418
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,167
I just move
a group through.

419
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:14,587
Anybody come around
asking about me?

420
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,389
No.

421
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,981
What are you doing, Frank?

422
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:26,182
Taking off soon.

423
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:29,018
And I'm signing
the place over to you.

424
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
All the way.

425
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:33,106
It's yours.

426
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,774
Thank you.

427
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:37,327
I was always grateful
for your help.

428
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:44,167
You heard about Ray?

429
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,170
It's a frame-up.

430
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,622
He'll be back here,
everything goes all right.

431
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,541
They're gonna need
transport to Mexico.

432
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:54,711
They?

433
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:56,796
Him and a woman.

434
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:00,717
What is going on? I heard
about the poker room.

435
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,686
Everything's ending.

436
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,305
Time to wake up.

Don't turn around or I'll cut you in
half before the show even starts.

450
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:11,731
Just listen closely.

451
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,316
You're fucking
this up, kid.

452
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:15,101
Who are you?

453
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:17,437
The guy you blasted
with a fucking shotgun

454
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,988
in your little bird mask.

455
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,941
That was Caspere's.
Sick fuck.

456
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,159
Could have killed you.

457
00:32:23,161 --> 00:32:25,278
Well, you don't need to
worry about that right now.

458
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:29,449
I know what they did.

459
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,701
- Why you're here.
- You know what they did?

460
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,789
To my father?
To me and my sister?

461
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,126
Executed.

462
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,679
Turned my sister
into a whore.

463
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:45,348
I know everything.

464
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,933
I want them, too.

465
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,469
But suicide ain't
gonna get that.

466
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,937
You want revenge?

467
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,472
Drag their shit out
into the light.

468
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,974
They won't get punished.

469
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:57,944
I am the blade
and the bullet.

470
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:04,150
Then listen
carefully to me.

471
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,554
The hard drive
is in this bag.

472
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,939
<i>Lot of interesting</i>
<i>things on there.</i>

473
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:21,728
A man with this, buy
himself a lot of juice.

474
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:30,203
What?

475
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,238
What, a wire?

476
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,706
See, I don't need
a wire, Chief.

477
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,291
I got plenty
of insurance.

478
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:38,377
What I need
is a payout.

479
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,413
The land documents.

480
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:42,465
They're in the bag, too.

481
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,085
The man who wanted to
meet, he killed Caspere?

482
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,587
Correct.

483
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,672
One of the Osterman kids.

484
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:51,891
All grown up.

485
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,309
Where is he now?

486
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,928
In a Vinci landfill.

487
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:59,515
I got copies
of everything.

488
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:04,020
Something happens
to me on the way out,

489
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,521
that shit hits the cloud.

490
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,241
News agencies.

491
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:09,609
What do you want?

492
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:12,111
Any chance
you brought the stones?

493
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:19,001
Plastic. Had I known
you were coming,

494
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:22,622
we could have made
different arrangements.

495
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:25,758
I want out from under.

496
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,927
I want my name cleared.

497
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:31,714
For the hard drive
and land documents?

498
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,716
Mm-hmm.

499
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,969
And Bezzerides?

500
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,638
Where is she?

501
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,807
Fuck should I know?

502
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:44,610
She and that Woodrugh guy
both thought I did Davis.

503
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,730
Think I've been working
for you the whole time.

504
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:50,032
Too bad you weren't.

505
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:54,487
Honestly, Ray, nobody had an
idea you were this competent.

506
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:59,208
You all bought your way
into Vinci with the stones.

507
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,328
Caspere made a deal
with Chessani.

508
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,664
Ben had a talent
for dissembling.

509
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,798
And Dixon?

510
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,717
He wasted his part
of the take, yeah?

511
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,169
He was looking to, what, blackmail
you guys for a new piece?

512
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,838
Where is this going, Ray?

513
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,173
Amarilla.
The shoot-out.

514
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,675
How did that happen?

515
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:18,561
He may have gotten
a tip about the raid.

516
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,932
Closed everything out,
didn't it?

517
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,353
Now you got a piece
of that central corridor.

518
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,693
You know
Chessani's dead, right?

519
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,778
Not the Chessani
I work for.

520
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,866
Cut the shit, Ray.

521
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:42,702
Whatever happened in '92
isn't the issue.

522
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:46,005
You want clear,
we put this on Bezzerides.

523
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,257
Geldof is already
on board.

524
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:55,381
No sudden movements, son.

525
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,934
You're public enemy
number one.

526
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,853
Don't even need a reason
to vaporize you.

527
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,478
Couldn't you have
just taken the stones?

528
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,314
Way back?

529
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,450
Did you have to kill
those people?

530
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:17,904
The Osterman woman had
been seeing Ben for years.

531
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:21,073
She was pregnant
and she knew things.

532
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,742
When he tried to break it
off, she threatened him.

533
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:25,828
Ben didn't even want the first
kid, much less another one.

534
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,630
The first one?

535
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,382
The girl.
The little one.

536
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,001
That was Ben's

537
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,826
- Downstairs!
- Oh, my God! Go!

538
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:01,414
- No!
- Move, move!

539
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,251
Out of the way!

You're a cop, right?

554
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,551
Lady cop.

555
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:48,804
What gave me away?
The tits?

556
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:54,310
I meant you're a lady.
You have dignity.

557
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:59,231
You like Ray?

558
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:04,737
I like Ray.

559
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,323
Sure that means
a lot to him.

560
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:10,576
Relationships
are important.

561
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,461
Maybe you disagree.

562
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:23,255
You take this Venezuela
deal we're talking,

563
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,724
you make it
to Barquisimeto,

564
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:29,562
there'll be this
lady there in two weeks

565
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:31,263
at this park.

566
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,599
El Obelisco.

567
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,651
Her name is Jordan.

568
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:38,187
If she's there
and I'm not,

569
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:40,406
maybe you can give
her a message.

570
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:44,994
What's that?

571
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,620
Tell her I wanted
to be there.

572
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:58,207
And that story we told,
it's still true.

573
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,875
Talk to you a minute?

574
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,634
Venezuela works.
Shit extradition.

575
00:41:41,636 --> 00:41:43,385
We could have good lives.

576
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:46,805
Well, I don't have
much choice at this point.

577
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:50,092
Anaheim went to shit.

578
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:52,561
Yeah, but a heist?

579
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:54,230
You got money to run?

580
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:57,516
Can't even access a bank.
No credit cards.

581
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:59,818
Even if retreat
was my inclination,

582
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,188
which it fucking is not,

583
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,407
you want to stay alive,
you and yours,

584
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,826
you need money.

585
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:23,542
You promised me
the guy who set me up.

586
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:26,212
It was Blake.

587
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:29,048
The guy you clipped was some
shit stain had it in for him.

588
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,184
Blake's gone.

589
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,136
He did not go nicely.

590
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,029
Maybe I spared
you that one.

591
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:50,035
These fucks will never
see it coming, man.

592
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:52,288
<i>Place is so far</i>
<i>up the mountain,</i>

593
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,157
it'll be a day before anybody
realizes what happened.

594
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,576
This is just
information, right?

595
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:00,713
Shit in the air.

596
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:03,249
That guy they're saying
you killed,

597
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,967
he was your buddy, right?

598
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,254
Actually,

599
00:43:08,256 --> 00:43:11,257
I don't think
I knew him that well.

600
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:12,925
But...

601
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:17,763
yeah, yeah,
he was my friend.

602
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:19,431
Maybe that means
something.

603
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,433
Call it what you want--

604
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:24,603
revenge, justice,

605
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,739
a retirement package.

606
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:28,657
Men like this...

607
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,611
they always skate.

608
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:35,497
Not with me they don't.

609
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:38,450
I did not live my life
to go out like this.

610
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,120
You?

611
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:53,382
We use a short cruise,
tourists to Ensenada.

612
00:43:53,384 --> 00:43:56,218
From there, we go south
to San Miguel.

613
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,354
My people are there.
We find someone.

614
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:00,472
We get you all
to Venezuela.

615
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,274
You've done this a lot?

616
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:06,612
Much easier to bring
people in than out.

617
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:09,481
I've been trying to get
Ray to see San Miguel.

618
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:12,401
How do you know them?

619
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:17,239
The man that hurt me
years ago,

620
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,658
Ray took care of him.

621
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,328
Put him in prison,
I mean.

622
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,912
Disabled wing.

623
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:28,417
Frank gave me the money
to buy this place.

624
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:30,803
Never asked
for it back.

625
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:39,228
How do you know Ray?

626
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:49,021
Well, I guess we saved
each other's lives.

627
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,450
Tony and Betty. Pitlor, I
want him on the record.

628
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:04,370
His files. We can
get confessions.

629
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:08,006
I've heard enough
confessions today.

630
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,714
Venezuela?

631
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:19,852
We got nothing
to run on.

632
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,807
And I owe these filth.

633
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,945
I owe Woodrugh.

634
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,577
Would you run?

635
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,965
Now?

636
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:52,751
If I asked,
would you?

637
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,803
I might.

638
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,259
I just might.

639
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,814
_

640
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:52,788
...a very strong foundation
on which to build a future.

641
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,508
There's a point
to the waltzing in.

642
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,462
I do not like beginning
something unfinished.

643
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:04,266
Mr. Agronov, have you
ever heard of moderation?

644
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:29,968
Guess I was wrong.

645
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,520
It was today.

646
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,723
Old times, Frank.

647
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,526
<i>I saved you.</i>

648
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:39,645
You're like my son.

649
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,891
- Stay down south.
- Yeah.

650
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:04,029
You're going, right?
We got to get out.

651
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,231
Yeah, that's the plan.

652
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,400
Thinking about
your boy?

653
00:51:10,738 --> 00:51:12,571
Now you can
send him to Yale.

654
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:14,906
Sure.

655
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:17,909
You taking the boat?

656
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,828
I made other arrangements.

657
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,798
- But I'll be there.
- All right.

658
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:10,095
They suicided Pitlor.

659
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,430
Loose ends.

660
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,266
No sign of Betty
or Tony anywhere.

661
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,051
Fuck it.
Later for them.

662
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:17,886
Maybe one day
we get it to the press.

663
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:21,857
Maybe that "Times" guy
who wrote about Vinci.

664
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:24,309
We got a hell
of a retirement bonus.

665
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:28,313
I'm on my way now.
You understand?

666
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,866
Yeah.

667
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:32,234
I understand.

668
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,153
<i>All right. You packed?</i>

669
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,155
Yeah, I'm all set.

670
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,540
Boat leaves at 3:00.

671
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:43,078
All right. I'm 40 miles out.
Plenty of time.

672
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,497
Well, hurry anyway.

673
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,416
All right.

674
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,385
I, uh...

675
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,509
I'll see you
in a bit.

676
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:59,594
Yeah.

677
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:02,647
Yeah.

678
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,357
He's okay.
He's on his way.

679
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:26,421
Thanks.

680
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:47,225
They have a total valuation
of $3.5 million.

681
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,311
I will stand by their grading
anywhere in the world.

682
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,606
Meets your bio data.

683
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,493
You're even a premium club
member in United and American.

684
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,530
That's your two
plus five.

685
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:52,958
Frank, you're full
of surprises.

686
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,710
The Russians?

687
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:59,347
I wonder when we will hear
about what you've done.

688
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:04,386
Another 500 when
I'm where I need to be.

689
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:23,738
Safe travels.

690
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,130
So Chad crossed the
bridge and lost Calvin's farm.

691
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:05,757
<i>Under five, you're
supposed to use the names.</i>

692
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:10,061
<i>17, that's within your</i>
<i>maximum power threshold.</i>

693
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:24,075
<i>Under five, you need</i>
<i>18 or higher to use...</i>

694
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,876
Yeah.

695
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:43,461
Yeah, all right.

696
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,123
Why?

697
01:01:22,899 --> 01:01:24,649
Hey, cutting it
a little close.

698
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:28,403
I, uh--
I'm gonna be late.

699
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:30,738
<i>The fuck are
you talking about?</i>

700
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,273
Get on that boat.

701
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,159
Wh-- what?

702
01:01:35,161 --> 01:01:37,195
You hear me?
You get on that boat.

703
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:38,663
I'll catch up.

704
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:40,748
Wait. What--
what is--

705
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,784
<i>No, just get here.</i>

706
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,786
I just wanted--

707
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,874
I thought we had time.

708
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,376
<i>What?</i>

709
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,547
I just wanted to see
my boy again.

710
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:57,715
What?

711
01:01:57,717 --> 01:02:00,351
<i>There's a transponder</i>
<i>on my car.</i>

712
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:05,022
Maybe they were watching
from school.

713
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:06,808
I don't know.

714
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,893
Dump it.

715
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,361
Come on,
get rid of it.

716
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:13,114
Put it on a truck headed north.
Come on-- shit, Ray.

717
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:14,732
I can't.

718
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:17,785
They could have already
been watching, see?

719
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:20,238
And if they got
eyes on me,

720
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,156
it won't matter what I do
with the tracker.

721
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:23,708
I'd just lead
them to you.

722
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,410
<i>You understand?</i>

723
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,578
- So what-- what are--
- You just get on the boat.

724
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,748
Just take the files, take the
recordings and get on that boat.

725
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,634
<i>Look, I'll ditch the car</i>

726
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:35,720
in a parking garage.

727
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:37,505
I'll jack another one.

728
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:41,008
I'll be
right on your heels.

729
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,344
Then I'll wait.

730
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:45,313
You stick to the plan.

731
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:47,064
<i>Please.</i>

732
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:49,934
Please get
onto the boat.

733
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,404
Trust me.

734
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:56,190
I can lose these assholes
with a tricycle.

735
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,277
Okay.

736
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,612
Yeah.

737
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:04,081
Listen, let me talk
to Felicia.

738
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:07,168
Please. All right?
Just for a second.

739
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,337
<i>I'm gonna talk
to you again, right?</i>

740
01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:11,456
We're gonna see
each other again?

741
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:15,293
Are you kidding?

742
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,595
You're gonna need
a restraining order.

743
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:23,351
No. No, I won't.

744
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:29,807
Okay.

745
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,946
- Hello.
- I'm not gonna make it.

746
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:38,282
<i>Don't ask,</i>
<i>just listen to me.</i>

747
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:41,486
You owe me, right?
You owe me.

748
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,404
<i>I don't care if you</i>
<i>have to tie her up,</i>

749
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:46,374
you make sure
she gets out.

750
01:03:46,376 --> 01:03:48,209
You get her out.

751
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,046
Okay.

752
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:54,131
I promise.

753
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:57,835
What did he say?

754
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:01,639
To make sure
you get on that boat.

755
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,983
You? What the fuck is this?

756
01:05:13,746 --> 01:05:18,082
A turn here, a turn there,
and it goes on for years.

757
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,384
Becomes something else.

758
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:27,008
I'm sorry,
you know,

759
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,560
for the man I became...

760
01:05:31,097 --> 01:05:33,147
the father I was.

761
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:38,069
I hope you got the strength
to learn from that.

762
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:44,325
And I hope you got no doubts
how much I loved you, son.

763
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,917
And you're better
than me.

764
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:56,621
If I had been stronger...

765
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:01,125
I would have been
more like you.

766
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:05,880
Hell, son...

767
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:11,302
if everyone was stronger,
they'd be more like you.

768
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,043
You taking me out?

769
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:38,412
I was already gone.

770
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:43,501
What the fuck
did you come out to say?

771
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:45,469
You made a deal.

772
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:47,755
No clubs,
no locations for us.

773
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:51,475
The clubs burned down.
What was I supposed to do?

774
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,644
Armenians, Russians,
this is their thing.

775
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:55,763
Where do the Armenians
get their supply,

776
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:57,682
what they gave to you?

777
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:01,686
You want to get square?

778
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,821
There's a flat million
in the suitcase.

779
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:05,906
That's my trade.

780
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,269
God damn it.

781
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,192
We're square, then,
our business?

782
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,113
That'll buy you something.

783
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:44,205
A million dollars doesn't
buy me a ride back to town?

784
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,509
Take his suit.

785
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:51,545
He wants your suit.

786
01:08:51,547 --> 01:08:53,047
Give it to him.

787
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:10,114
You want my suit?

788
01:09:10,116 --> 01:09:14,318
Hurry. Come on.

789
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,903
All right.

790
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,957
I didn't even wear a suit
till I was 38.

791
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,050
Stop, stop, stop!

792
01:09:32,004 --> 01:09:34,171
- We kill him?
- What for?

793
01:09:34,173 --> 01:09:36,757
Fuck!

794
01:09:38,177 --> 01:09:39,927
We made a nice bed
for you.

795
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:42,429
Lie down, Frank.

796
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:46,684
Oh, fuck.

797
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,584
Fuck.

798
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:09,623
It's okay.
It's okay.

799
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:37,795
<i>I don't know, boy.</i>

800
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:40,798
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>them other kids like you.</i>

801
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,801
I don't think
anybody does.

802
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:47,805
Who the fuck wants
some lanky loudmouth

803
01:11:47,807 --> 01:11:49,974
pissing in
their ear, huh?

804
01:11:49,976 --> 01:11:52,309
<i>Your mother sure didn't.</i>

805
01:11:52,311 --> 01:11:53,644
<i>It's what made her sick.</i>

806
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:57,448
Your fucking whining,
that's why she's gone.

807
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:00,317
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

808
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,653
Faggot.

809
01:12:02,655 --> 01:12:04,738
<i>Scared of the dark.</i>

810
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:08,242
Yeah, I never loved you.

811
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:10,461
I never asked you to.

812
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,463
Shut up.

813
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:14,048
Shut the fuck up.

814
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:45,029
Still got time, Ray.

815
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:47,281
<i>Where's the papers?</i>

816
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:49,283
Where's the woman?

817
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,655
<i>Yes, yes, gawky
motherfucker.</i>

818
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,659
<i>I told you not</i>
<i>to come around here.</i>

819
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:08,862
You fucking retarded
or something?

820
01:14:08,864 --> 01:14:10,280
Told you what
would happen to you.

821
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:11,999
Fuck your shit up,
Larry Bird.

822
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,168
Stop and lie down,
you dumb motherfucker.

823
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,503
Fuck you.

824
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:18,122
Never lie down.

825
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:40,477
Last time, Ray.

826
01:14:42,064 --> 01:14:43,730
Let me help you.

827
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:07,421
Bezzerides.

828
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,142
Where is she?

829
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,680
In a better place.

830
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:29,458
_

831
01:16:57,616 --> 01:17:00,000
Please, Frank. They
don't have to do this.

832
01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:02,953
Tell them. Tell them
I'll make it up.

833
01:17:02,955 --> 01:17:05,756
I got stupid.

834
01:17:05,758 --> 01:17:07,291
Please.

835
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:09,459
Frank, you could
let me go.

836
01:17:09,461 --> 01:17:11,295
They'll never know.

837
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:14,798
It's not me.
I didn't put you here.

838
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,850
But you could
get me out.

839
01:17:16,852 --> 01:17:19,469
Please, Frank.
I got a family.

840
01:17:19,471 --> 01:17:21,938
It isn't me.

841
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:37,120
<i>Hi there, handsome.</i>

842
01:17:45,664 --> 01:17:46,830
You made it.

843
01:17:50,169 --> 01:17:51,335
You okay?

844
01:17:51,337 --> 01:17:54,171
I did.

845
01:17:54,173 --> 01:17:55,889
I'm fine.

846
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:57,674
<i>I'm safe.</i>

847
01:17:57,676 --> 01:17:59,343
I'm coming.

848
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:03,597
Hold on.

849
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:18,912
What's a guy like you
doing in a place like this?

850
01:18:27,256 --> 01:18:29,089
Just making my way, baby.

851
01:18:33,212 --> 01:18:36,213
I told you
I'd make it.

852
01:18:36,215 --> 01:18:39,099
You did.

853
01:18:39,101 --> 01:18:41,051
You made it.

854
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:44,054
You can rest now.

855
01:18:44,056 --> 01:18:46,473
No rest.

856
01:18:46,475 --> 01:18:48,275
Never stop moving.

857
01:18:48,277 --> 01:18:49,810
<i>Babe...</i>

858
01:18:50,863 --> 01:18:53,563
Oh, babe.

859
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:56,950
You stopped moving
way back there.

860
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:47,701
<i>The former sheriff's
deputy and City of Vinci detective</i>

861
01:19:47,703 --> 01:19:49,453
<i>was the chief suspect</i>
<i>in the murder</i>

862
01:19:49,455 --> 01:19:52,339
<i>of a state attorney and a
state police investigator.</i>

863
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:54,458
<i>He was employed</i>
<i>as a security consultant</i>

864
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,511
<i>at a Vinci casino,</i>
<i>which recently burned down.</i>

865
01:19:57,513 --> 01:20:00,263
<i>After a lengthy pursuit,</i>
<i>the fugitive engaged</i>

866
01:20:00,265 --> 01:20:03,099
<i>a tactical squad</i>
<i>of state and city police</i>

867
01:20:03,101 --> 01:20:06,052
<i>in a firefight</i>
<i>which resulted in his death.</i>

868
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:09,035
_

869
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:14,577
_

870
01:20:49,717 --> 01:20:54,461
_

871
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:03,159
<i>A lot of the rest was in the
papers over the next year...</i>

872
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:07,581
<i>if you know where to look.</i>

873
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,530
_

874
01:21:11,537 --> 01:21:14,204
<i>These facts were
paid for in blood...</i>

875
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:18,708
<i>so honor that.</i>

876
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:21,500
_

877
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:24,514
<i>I don't know if it'll</i>
<i>make any difference,</i>

878
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:27,217
<i>but it should</i>

879
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:29,853
<i>because we deserve</i>
<i>a better world.</i>

880
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:54,794
<i>And I owe him that.</i>

881
01:21:55,747 --> 01:21:57,797
I owe his sons that.

882
01:22:00,335 --> 01:22:02,419
Anyways...

883
01:22:04,756 --> 01:22:06,423
this is evidence.

884
01:22:06,425 --> 01:22:09,593
Most of it's here,
some of it's not.

885
01:22:09,595 --> 01:22:11,561
<i>The truth...</i>

886
01:22:11,563 --> 01:22:13,897
<i>is naked larceny,</i>

887
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:16,349
open murder,

888
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:19,069
and cascading betrayals.

889
01:22:26,828 --> 01:22:28,328
Come with me.

890
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,113
Testify.

891
01:22:30,115 --> 01:22:32,032
I can bring this
to the "Times."

892
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:35,619
It's your story now.

893
01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:37,203
I told it.

894
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,174
- But wait, there's--
- Stay here.

895
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:44,628
Don't leave this room until
I've been gone for an hour.

896
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,796
Understand?

897
01:23:02,898 --> 01:23:04,481
