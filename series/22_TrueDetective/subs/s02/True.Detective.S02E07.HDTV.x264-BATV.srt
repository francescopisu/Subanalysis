_

35
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,434
I feel so fucked up.

36
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,603
My head's so fucked up.

37
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,106
You want me to roll a joint?

38
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,775
<i>Oh, those fucking fucks.</i>

39
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,195
Holloway was there.

40
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,114
Fucking Geldof.

41
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,201
The fucking AG was shaking
hands with the...

42
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,290
That piece of shit
tried to choke me out.

43
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,382
He put his hands
on the wrong...

44
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,307
I've been waiting
my whole life for that.

45
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,314
I think I even...

46
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,235
went looking.

47
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,405
That's my whole life.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,869
And when I ran out of the
woods and they found me...

49
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,871
The woods?

50
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,082
What?

51
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,086
What?

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,047
You said...

53
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,424
Oh, God.

54
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,787
Hey, look, I don't think...

55
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:19,959
This wouldn't help you.

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,962
It might.

57
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,799
It usually does.

58
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,303
All right.

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,563
<i>Oh, it's the drugs.</i>
It's the drugs.

60
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:42,314
I'm fucked up.

61
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,359
Mmm.

62
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,571
You're too far out
of my league anyway.

63
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:53,452
I'm gonna check out
the other two.

64
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,415
You and the girl, you should
stay here through tomorrow.

65
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:01,543
You know, we can see
what the damage is

66
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,503
and report all this to Davis.

67
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,922
Yeah.

68
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,384
You can call your sister.

69
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,098
Addenda to corporate charters
for holding companies,

70
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:20,103
shares dispersed to new owners--
Eagle Iron LLC.

71
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:24,190
President Osip Agranov.

72
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,859
Electralux Entertainment.

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,779
President Anthony Chessani.

74
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:36,453
It shows the holding
company's assets.

75
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,793
These are all land parcels
in that corridor.

76
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,047
Valley poisoned by mine runoff.

77
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:54,428
There was some kind of
buy/sell deal upon death.

78
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:57,305
I mean, they just repurchased
Caspere's shares for pennies

79
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:58,475
and redistributed them.

80
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:00,142
Motive.

81
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,478
Well, it's something.

82
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,619
_

83
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,042
Everything all right?

84
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:27,337
Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,548
It's just my fiancée.

86
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,858
Okay, what's next?

87
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:52,695
I got to, uh--

88
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:54,614
I got to check in at home.

89
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,381
We should drop this on Davis.

90
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,467
<i>You want to hold the fort?</i>

91
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,470
Question her when she comes up.

92
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,140
Yeah.

93
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,397
You think they could make me
for that security guard?

94
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,400
Would they?

95
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,570
I don't know.

96
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,262
I hoped you'd make it home.

97
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,724
But I guess here
is good enough.

98
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,560
Took a couple kicks last night.

99
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,562
Can you talk about it?

100
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,565
There'll be some new people
operating at the clubs

101
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,858
for a while, a few days a week.

102
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,819
What people?

103
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,156
Mexicans.
Something else to solve.

104
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,823
In the midst of being
gangbanged by forces unseen,

105
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,575
I figure I'd drill
a new orifice,

106
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,871
go on and fuck myself
for a change.

107
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,664
Frank, what can you
pull together?

108
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:29,709
Liquid right now?

109
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,129
Maybe 200K.
Three tops.

110
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,884
We could just walk away
from the table.

111
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:41,429
That's 45 years of my life.

112
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,473
You see me managing
an Applebee's?

113
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,267
I worked at one once.

114
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,561
They give you a shift meal.

115
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,737
I'll handle
the deliveries at Lux.

116
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,159
Mrs. Semyon.
You look lovely this morning.

117
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,828
Ray, dashing as ever.

118
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:09,290
Keep it holstered.

119
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,352
Aw. A little bit of
a strange night.

120
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,442
<i>You should just tell
me what's going on, Paul.</i>

121
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,111
The men on the phone scared me.

122
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,947
He said, "Ask Paul
about the pictures."

123
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,283
That's all he said.

124
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:46,118
He hung up.

125
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,453
What is this about?

126
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,955
<i>Tell me or I'm not going.</i>

127
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,625
It was that case.
I was undercover.

128
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,296
I just want you to be safe
for a couple days.

129
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,717
We are having a baby.

130
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,470
This will all
be cleared up by then.

131
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,473
Why did you get with me, Paul?

132
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,977
Why did you even ask me out?

133
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:19,068
I'm just trying
to be a good man.

134
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,740
Well, you don't try right.

135
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:34,291
<i>What happened?</i>

136
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,711
It was bad in there.

137
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,963
If they think I was you,

138
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:43,009
you need to disappear
for a little while.

139
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,635
What?

140
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:47,971
How am I supposed to disappear?

141
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:49,807
I'll give you some money.

142
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,935
Go up north.
Oregon, maybe.

143
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,812
Dad knows some people.

144
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,065
He should go,
too, just--

145
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,399
just to be safe.

146
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,067
For how long?

147
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,778
I-- I'm seeing someone

148
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,322
and I'm starting
school in the fall.

149
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,991
We just need
to put this case down.

150
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,410
And then you're okay.

151
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:13,038
But you gotta go.
Both of you.

152
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,207
Now, like today.

153
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,002
You get somebody to put some of
your things together for you.

154
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,004
You don't go back home.

155
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,507
What did you do?

156
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,551
I saved a girl.

157
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,472
She's in the next room

158
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:33,850
coming off of whatever
they had her on.

159
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,728
Did they give you something?

160
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,777
Did you go all the way in?

161
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,613
Inside the party?

162
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,032
Yeah.

163
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,786
Did you?

164
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:16,476
I don't see how you can
expect us to stay here.

165
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:19,186
<i>Paul, if something
this wrong is going on,</i>

166
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,521
<i>maybe you should go</i>
<i>to your bosses.</i>

167
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,897
Tell them you need out.

168
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,691
It's more complicated
than that.

169
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,570
The less you know, the better.

170
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,405
I can't go to the bosses,
not yet.

171
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,158
This op I did,
it might be nothing.

172
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,827
But I just want
you both to be safe

173
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,081
if my cover was blown,
that's it.

174
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,790
Two, three nights tops.

175
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,584
And what are we supposed to do?

176
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,753
Room service.

177
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:49,718
Don't answer the door
or the phone if it isn't me.

178
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,764
And, you know, just relax.

179
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,395
Okay.

180
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,363
You bring someone up,

181
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:13,658
invest time and emotion,

182
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,618
personal attachment,

183
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,747
and hope for what?

184
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,040
Parity.

185
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,999
Well, this is
way bigger than Blake.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,834
You got probable
future governor

187
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,253
and current Attorney
General Geldof there.

188
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,380
And that guy from Catalast,
McCandless,

189
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,466
- he closed the deal.
- What deal?

190
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,427
We got these documents from one
of Catalast's holding companies,

191
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:36,472
transferred ownership of assets,
land in that rail corridor.

192
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,766
Now, they sold Caspere's shares
in two other companies.

193
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,063
One of them's owned by the mayor's kid,
Tony Chessani.

194
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:44,440
Him?
Kid's a twist.

195
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:47,232
I fixed a hit and run
for him once-- motherfucker.

196
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,612
Well, the other company's
owned by this older cat.

197
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,321
He was at the party.

198
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:54,658
I saw him at the warehouse
where they dropped the girls last week.

199
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,952
Looked European.

200
00:13:56,994 --> 00:14:00,330
Papers said his name was...

201
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,667
Osip Agranov.

202
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,129
He's Russian Israeli.

203
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,633
Blake was listed
as the holding company's treasurer.

204
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,802
So to me, it looked like
your man helped Tony

205
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,472
and this other guy
fuck you out of Caspere's shares.

206
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:19,891
It could be they killed
Caspere for them.

207
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,019
My old chief Holloway,
he was there, too.

208
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,232
The girl, Irina Rulfo,

209
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,027
she's had a cop gave her
Caspere's stash.

210
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,529
Paid her to pawn it.

211
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,823
She said he was white.

212
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,490
You found Irina?

213
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,493
Sort of.

214
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,330
She's gone.

215
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:51,214
You got a name for me?

216
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:53,592
The man who put you on
my wife's attacker?

217
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,638
I'll have it for you
by the end of the day.

218
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,557
Word of honor.

219
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:04,144
I guess I'll continue
with the belief it wasn't you.

220
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,231
Uh-huh.

221
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,775
Ray...

222
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,611
go ahead and show
yourself out just now.

223
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,239
I need a few minutes alone,

224
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,992
process the ins
and outs of all this.

225
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,035
Sure.

226
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,955
I gotta go anyways.

227
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:37,802
Woodrugh, Velcoro.

228
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,054
The Rulfo girl said a policeman paid her
to pawn Caspere's stuff.

229
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,640
Look in LAPD service records,
all right.

230
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,436
Find out where
Holloway was in '92

231
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,604
and who else was in his squad.

232
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,146
Davis is meeting me
this afternoon.

233
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,775
I want her to see
those signatures in person.

234
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,402
<i>Your sister put me onto you.</i>

235
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,363
Said you were missing.

236
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:03,787
And then this
was delivered to her.

237
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,457
Contents of a mailbox you kept.

238
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,500
I need you to look
at this stuff.

239
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,503
These pictures.

240
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,304
Oh, shit, man.

241
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,348
Forgot I kept that box.

242
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,601
Right.

243
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,396
Yeah, Tascha
must have sent these.

244
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:30,981
Tascha?

245
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,523
You know Ben Caspere?

246
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,277
He had a girl
he introduced as Tascha.

247
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,823
Yeah.

248
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:44,411
I met Ben at
the Panticapaem Institute

249
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,497
when I was a maid.

250
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,831
He was the one.

251
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,668
He hooked me up on the circuit.

252
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,090
Tascha-- God--
was his, like, favorite.

253
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:58,092
She's Hungarian.

254
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,219
But she had these plans.

255
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,099
<i>Photos of these parties.</i>
<i>I warned her.</i>

256
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,935
Fuck, maybe she sent
these as backup.

257
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:11,394
Bitch tried to involve me in that shit.

258
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,065
She tried to blackmail them.

259
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,275
I warned her.

260
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,819
Dudes like this don't play.

261
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,487
All right, what about
these diamonds?

262
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,365
They mean anything to you?

263
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,157
Those must be--

264
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:27,830
Yeah, she had said once
that Caspere had shown her these diamonds.

265
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:30,581
Said they were special like.

266
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,084
What happened to Tascha?

267
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:40,676
Wherever we were,
it was someplace up north.

268
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,263
They found a camera.

269
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,391
So I think there was a cabin

270
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,561
out back.

271
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,814
It was Tony C and their guys.

272
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,691
<i>They took her into the woods.</i>

273
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:58,569
- Will you testify?
- Fuck, no.

274
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,738
I was hammered anyway.

275
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,531
You know what? Thinking about it,
I don't know what I've seen.

276
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,368
Is that when you
tried to get out?

277
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:09,538
I never tried to get out.

278
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,206
Girl fucked up.

279
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,543
All you gotta do
is follow the rules.

280
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:16,336
I didn't want to get out.

281
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,045
You feel me?

282
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,632
I was never missing.

283
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,218
You didn't look
like you wanted to be

284
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,470
where you were
when I found you.

285
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:28,765
I took too much Molly
on top of champagne.

286
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:35,105
So what?
It happens.

287
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,149
All right, so...

288
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,985
who's the other girl?

289
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,778
Her name is Laura, maybe.

290
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,238
I ain't seen her
in like five, six months.

291
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,200
Maybe they took her
out to the cabin?

292
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:50,745
No, she wasn't dumb
like Tascha.

293
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,165
Look, can I just get a ride?

294
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,082
Or call somebody?

295
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,918
Your sister's on her way.

296
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,962
What the fuck?

297
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,880
You don't think
my sister's fucked up?

298
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:05,550
The way she waits hand and foot on that
panty-sniffing motherfucker?

299
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,137
Better than being strung out.

300
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:10,098
Yo, I have a place.

301
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,059
I got nice things.

302
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,770
I had a good thing
with Tony and his people.

303
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,979
Maybe-- and this
is just a thought,

304
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,276
maybe you were put on Earth
for more than fucking.

305
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,906
Everything is fucking.

306
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,470
Oh, thank God.

307
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,140
No, stop.
I am not going with you.

308
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,016
Fuck your <i>pervertido</i> husband.

309
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:58,144
- He's different now.
- You need to lay low, Vera.

310
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:01,481
Stay with your sister.
I'll let you know when it's safe.

311
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,068
Till then, you're in danger.

312
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,279
You fucking<i> putas.</i>
You put me in danger.

313
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,822
And I'm the only one
who can get you out.

314
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:12,242
You reach out to those men,
I'll let them know you talked to a cop

315
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,329
and they'll paint
a cabin with you.

316
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,717
_

317
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,303
You motherfuckers.

318
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,318
_

319
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,279
Holy fuck.

320
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,699
_

321
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,868
_

322
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,537
Shit.

323
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,840
Late today.

324
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,466
Had to get Ivar
covering the pit.

325
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:12,345
Sorry, boss.
I was taking care of some stuff.

326
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,891
The girls had a
little private thing last night.

327
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,269
15 Gs.

328
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,395
- Yours.
- Holy cow.

329
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:24,815
You must be what they call
a natural-born pimp.

330
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,112
Me, I always saw a difference between
a whore and a pimp.

331
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,991
A whore can still
have integrity.

332
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,494
You want to move me up,
let me know.

333
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,830
That's the thing, right?

334
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,917
There's nothing
to move you up to.

335
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,085
Is there?

336
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:49,925
I mean, all my shit's been
taken down to the street.

337
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,596
You'll get it back, boss.

338
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:57,432
Everybody knows you will.

339
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,185
Stan was following you.

340
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,271
And he wasn't
the subtlest guy in the world,

341
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:06,441
so I'm guessing that
you spotted the tail.

342
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:09,319
Hey, look, boss,
I don't know--

343
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,779
What did he see you doing

344
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,991
caused you to punch
his ticket like that?

345
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:19,286
You took his eyes.
Why?

346
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,331
To make it look
connected to Caspere?

347
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,086
Truth is your only
play right now,

348
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,629
because you fucked up

349
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,298
letting yourself be alone

350
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,967
in this room with me.

351
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:37,764
Look, Frank, there's been
a mistake somewhere.

352
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,849
You're arrogant.

353
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,143
Or else you never would
have walked in here.

354
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,015
Have I got a fucking
story for you.

355
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,270
Hell.

356
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,209
Please-- ah!

357
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,671
Please.
Frank, please.

358
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,881
- I can--
- You can what?

359
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:56,843
Talk? Osip?

360
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,511
His crew?

361
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:01,305
Caspere? Stan?

362
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,348
Osip's people,
they've been running Eastern Bloc girls

363
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:07,351
through Southern California
for over a year, Frank.

364
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:09,395
Osip's been moving
to take your spot

365
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,316
ever since
your meeting in Paris.

366
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,360
With your help, huh?

367
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,945
They reached out.

368
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,238
All these moves you were making,
you'd have done the same.

369
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,991
You think they give a shit
about handshakes?

370
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:24,746
You never should have
brought this to Osip.

371
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:32,420
Fuck.

372
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,470
You kill Caspere?
Or did Osip?

373
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,387
No, no. Nobody knows
who that was, man. Nobody.

374
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:44,889
So where's the money
I gave him?

375
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,558
Caspere was always
gonna fuck you, Frank.

376
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,187
Osip was backing the play.

377
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,271
Osip and Tony Chessani,

378
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,608
they're absorbing
Caspere's action?

379
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,985
- Why'd you kill Stan?
- He saw me meeting Osip and his guy.

380
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:00,949
He wanted a payoff, Frank.
He tried blackmailing me.

381
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,243
- Bullshit.
- What the fuck? It's bullshit.

382
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,452
You got all these
big plans, land deals.

383
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:08,873
Where was that supposed
to leave us?

384
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,502
You taught me, "Make
your own opportunities."

385
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:16,463
That guy way back,
Velcoro's wife,

386
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,299
who was that guy you gave up?

387
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,801
What? Velcoro?
Frank, what--

388
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:24,847
He didn't hurt Ray's wife.
Who was he?

389
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,100
This fucking meth head.

390
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,852
He said I ripped him off.
He was gonna come after me.

391
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:33,147
I heard about
this deputy's wife.

392
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,649
I saw a chance
to step up for you,

393
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,901
get noticed.

394
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,070
Look me in the eyes.

395
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,906
I want to watch
your lights go out.

396
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:50,498
I can get money back.
I know where there's money.

397
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,756
Osip and Catalast,

398
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,009
there's a big cash exchange
tomorrow night up in Ojai.

399
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,678
McCandless's place.
Crystal Ranch.

400
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,433
Osip's turning over 12 million
for Caspere's shares.

401
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,016
12 million, Frank.

402
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:11,561
Who's gonna be there?

403
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,353
I don't know for sure.

404
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,983
It's a handoff.
Security.

405
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:19,527
Osip, he'll be there.

406
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:25,700
All right.
Get yourself together.

407
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,038
Anything else you can tell me?

408
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,624
Anything?

409
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:37,044
Might help.

410
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:49,723
They're taking it all, Frank.

411
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,893
Osip's people bought
the liens on the clubs.

412
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,477
My people won't
go along with that.

413
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,647
You don't have any people, Frank,
that's what I'm saying.

414
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:59,525
Nails, they never
approached him.

415
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,569
But anybody else,
they already bought.

416
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,447
Ivar.

417
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,157
Anything else?

418
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,784
Look,

419
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:11,954
they don't know you got me now.

420
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:15,916
I can work on the inside
for you, man.

421
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,584
Triple-cross.

422
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,462
Do this for me instead.

423
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:22,256
I can--

424
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:27,261
<i>Remember where I found you?</i>

425
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,805
Pushing Baby Aspirin
to club kids.

426
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:32,850
Johnny Mank wanted
to cap you in the alley.

427
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:36,479
I said, "Nah,
there's potential here."

428
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,692
Now you just shit my carpet.

429
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,356
<i>Can't remember anything?
Something I can use?</i>

430
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:24,527
<i>Well, I grouped them</i>
<i>as hedonists.</i>

431
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:28,321
<i>And they seemed very close</i>
<i>in a secretive way.</i>

432
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:32,618
<i>And they did not stay long.
We had no real relationship.</i>

433
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:35,078
You seem pretty friendly here.

434
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,415
Well, at the time
everyone was a pilgrim.

435
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:42,084
You understand? Everyone was passing
in their separate journeys.

436
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,255
And not all looking
for the same thing.

437
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,048
Some exploit openness
and freedom.

438
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,176
It was a shadow
of our best intentions.

439
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:53,179
But people came and went,
faces lost.

440
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,641
I regret so much of that time.

441
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:09,530
I remembered his face finally.

442
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:14,910
The man who took me away.

443
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:19,123
You always said
you couldn't remember anything.

444
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,377
People came and went.

445
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,048
But there was a man...

446
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,343
and I remember his face.

447
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:38,683
And I think I always
remembered it.

448
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:41,186
We couldn't sleep.

449
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:43,647
I wandered the forest
for four days.

450
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,149
Can't see it, those four days,

451
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,528
but I remembered his face.

452
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,907
I wish I could--
if I could just give you back--

453
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,785
my father-- you see,
my father, he was--

454
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,872
He was a harsh man.
He was strict.

455
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:02,041
I wasn't going to be like him.

456
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:06,419
Oh, God.

457
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,880
God damn everything.

458
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:11,342
That's what I say.

459
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,184
Are you gonna turn yourself in?

460
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,852
No.

461
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,938
I can't.

462
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,024
But I can fix it.

463
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,945
I wish your life
had been easier.

464
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:39,036
You didn't ask me if I did it.

465
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:40,536
It doesn't matter.

466
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:43,207
You're the most innocent
person I've ever known.

467
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:06,763
Thank you.
I won't forget this.

468
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,016
The APB on you,
they're watching your house.

469
00:31:10,017 --> 00:31:12,269
I should have trusted you
with more of this.

470
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,771
I think with that harassment,

471
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,607
I could have stepped up more.

472
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,442
- Helped you out.
- It's all right.

473
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,443
I was jealous.

474
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,112
I'll say it.

475
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,115
I should have stopped
thinking of you that way

476
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,615
or switched partners.

477
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:28,619
No, I fucked up there.

478
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,787
You didn't.

479
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,624
I think I--

480
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,961
I think I might be unfair
to people sometimes.

481
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,717
Stay safe.

482
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,886
And stay alive.

483
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:55,437
Please be careful.
Please get out of this.

484
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:57,064
I will.

485
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,742
Follow them to Eugene.

486
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:12,995
They're gonna exit.
Better if you don't know where.

487
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:16,248
- And watch for tails more than anything.
- Copy that.

488
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,962
Had to toss my phone,
so I'll call you on a burner, check in.

489
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:21,754
Thank you for this.

490
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:23,591
Again.

491
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:25,176
Fuck you, Bezzerides.

492
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:43,151
Got three in one day.

493
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:45,069
Bet that's a record.

494
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,176
Delegate nothing.

495
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:10,261
It's worse than we thought.

496
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:13,724
We've been in a secret war here
the last six months or so.

497
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,391
Everybody's bought.

498
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,268
Ivar?

499
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:19,103
Don't tip, either.

500
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,440
Better they think
we're in the dark.

501
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:24,943
Jordan just walked in.

502
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:27,028
I'll catch her.

503
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:28,613
No.

504
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:31,242
Bring her inside.

505
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:47,382
Here we are.

506
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:49,760
Under the bright lights.

507
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:57,017
They're taking everything,
even what we got left.

508
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,647
<i>They'll come for me.</i>

509
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,945
What can I do?

510
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:20,498
Pack a bag.
Neils is going with you.

511
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:22,376
You can't stay at home any more.

512
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:23,751
All right.

513
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,921
I'll meet you tomorrow.

514
00:34:26,922 --> 00:34:28,506
I love you.

515
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:31,010
I love you.

516
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:49,445
This is GIA graded
with a dossier.

517
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,696
It tests excellent in optical

518
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,615
and symmetry analysis.

519
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:56,869
Five carats, $700,000.

520
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,371
It'll be between
five and six million.

521
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,790
I'd rather split the total
among more stones.

522
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,124
They don't all need
to be that high-end.

523
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,628
But I'll need the exchange
to happen fast.

524
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,921
Then it is not
about the stones.

525
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:11,966
It is about the money
behind the stones.

526
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:15,471
You are changing money you
are not supposed to have.

527
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:18,723
We do not engage
in such practices.

528
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:21,643
The money will be
untraceable in itself.

529
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:24,897
Abner Ehrman told me
I could work with you.

530
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:28,566
Please, articulate
the percentage

531
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,570
you'd require in order
to transact with me.

532
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,155
40%.

533
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:36,407
And all exchanges happen here.

534
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:39,826
As we have not done business,
like today, you will come alone.

535
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,997
It includes
my guarantee of quality

536
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:45,125
and a secure exchange.

537
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,512
Have your friends
ever been to Venezuela?

538
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,597
No, they've talked about going.

539
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,809
I wanted to treat them.
Engagement present.

540
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,561
Barquisimeto is beautiful.

541
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:08,438
I've got them both booked out
of Portland in five days.

542
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,857
And the tickets are alterable?
We can change them up if we need to?

543
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:13,862
Yes, sir. For that price, they
let you do what you want.

544
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,821
Ours are the best.

545
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:19,116
Digital everything,
including the chip.

546
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:22,703
But you still owe us
for the consignment, Frank.

547
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:24,372
300.

548
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,041
Which I'll pay
the day after tomorrow.

549
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:29,044
- With an extra five on top.
- With what?

550
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,632
You know about the Russians?

551
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:37,760
They're dropping roots--
women, drugs.

552
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:40,931
Taking a chunk of development
along the rail corridor.

553
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:45,185
You'll be taken over
inside a year.

554
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,022
Give me what I need,

555
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:52,234
I'll help them choke
on their piece of pie.

556
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,360
That's 100 now,

557
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,239
seven, day after tomorrow.

558
00:36:58,198 --> 00:37:00,866
And this buys what?

559
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,536
I need two clean cars
that are fast

560
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:06,163
and some firepower.

561
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,415
Why trust we'd ever
see you again?

562
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,752
Because I need
that clean passport.

563
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,837
Then I'm moving on.

564
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,880
I get where I'm going,

565
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,133
I got another half mil for you.

566
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,011
What are you planning, Frank?

567
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:24,306
You might say
my ship's come in.

568
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,143
And who sails this ship?

569
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,943
You got an APB
on Davis's murder?

570
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:39,656
Davis was supposed to meet
me and get the whole story.

571
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,323
Found her there dead.

572
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,618
They probably did it with one
of the pieces I keep at home.

573
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,789
I switched license plates
at a fucking mall.

574
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,125
That's it, then.
She was our only authority.

575
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,503
You and her are fugitives.

576
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:59,843
Well, it doesn't make sense.

577
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:04,180
It was cops.

578
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,515
Back in the '92 robbery,

579
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,641
Burris and Dixon were serving
under Holloway.

580
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,812
Caspere worked
at the same station.

581
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:13,189
Jewelry store
was their district.

582
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,484
Caspere probably
helped them move the stones.

583
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,902
They were all working together.

584
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:19,862
Orphaned two kids.

585
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,531
<i>Leonard and Laura.</i>

586
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,910
So that's how they bought in.

587
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:28,162
The diamonds
and whatever they got for them

588
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:30,372
went to Chessani.

589
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,584
Next couple of years,
they migrate

590
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:35,294
into six-figure
salaries in Vinci.

591
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:37,047
Their own private fiefdom.

592
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,839
Except Dixon.

593
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,716
He was just a regular dick.

594
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:44,513
Dixon was checking in on those
diamonds before we ever found them.

595
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:48,683
Maybe he knew Caspere
held onto them.

596
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:52,143
Maybe it meant
leverage for him.

597
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:53,811
But Dixon taking that headshot,

598
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,730
I checked every arrest record.

599
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:57,649
<i>Burris busted</i>
<i>Ledo Amarilla in '06.</i>

600
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,693
Released after interrogation,
no notes kept.

601
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:02,072
<i>That whole day was a setup.</i>

602
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,156
Amarilla, too.

603
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:06,574
He thought it was gonna go
a different way, I think.

604
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:09,536
That's what Caspere's
place was tossed for.

605
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,246
Burris, Holloway,
Dixon, whoever,

606
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:12,956
they were looking
for those diamonds.

607
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:16,543
The last piece of evidence
for a 23-year-old double murder.

608
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,547
Tascha was gonna
blackmail Caspere.

609
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:22,633
So Holloway, Burris,
they killed Caspere.

610
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,718
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

611
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,471
Him dying bought them all exposure,
kicked this whole thing off.

612
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:31,935
And if they had Caspere, why wouldn't they
torture him for the fucking diamonds?

613
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,728
I mean, it's--

614
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:43,280
_

615
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:52,663
I gotta head home soon.

616
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:54,039
All right.

617
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,083
Could you take this to State?

618
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:58,294
<i>State?</i>
Davis is dead.

619
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,673
Geldof was at the party.
How about Ventura Sheriff's?

620
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:03,590
Oh.

621
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:05,176
They're looking to do me.

622
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:11,098
And what have we got?
Some documents for a holding company?

623
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,934
A theory on some
rogue cops from '92?

624
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,687
- <i> Feds?</i>
- Not without more.

625
00:40:16,688 --> 00:40:18,229
Unless one of you guys
got a friend there,

626
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,691
I don't see protection.

627
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:27,906
That ain't a fucking mayor.

628
00:40:27,907 --> 00:40:32,745
That's a homunculus
state corporations slid into office.

629
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,080
Who the fuck
even is Los Angeles?

630
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:37,916
Nobody can say.
See? Nobody knows.

631
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:40,586
Nobody expects shit
to actually work.

632
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:43,047
<i>Me, my family, we are Vinci.</i>

633
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,717
We're a goddamn
political dynasty.

634
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:49,137
Like the Kennedys.

635
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,516
Do me a favor,
hum my balls a little, huh?

636
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:00,189
Maybe later.

637
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,941
Frank.

638
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:06,779
Another gin.

639
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,906
Time to hit the road, Austin.

640
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:12,325
You don't tell me
what time it is.

641
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:15,453
I'm just thinking you might want to
get home and take care of business.

642
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:17,205
What the fuck's that mean?

643
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:20,583
Your boy Prince Tony has been greasing
the skids to slide into your chair.

644
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:23,127
Buying the attorney general
with his hookers.

645
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,379
Working with a Russian
named Osip Agranov,

646
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,381
Jacob McCandless from Catalast.

647
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:29,928
All this in your house
behind your back.

648
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:33,765
Sober up.
You might realize you're getting fucked.

649
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:37,227
Now get out of here.
Closing time all around.

650
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,992
I'd have known,
I'd have gotten the red carpet out.

651
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:54,953
Let me make you a drink.

652
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:14,763
Our company bought
the lien here, Frank.

653
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:17,099
Same thing at the Lux.

654
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,600
The clubs are ours.

655
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,394
The clubs?

656
00:42:20,395 --> 00:42:23,940
Shit, man, I'm working
just to stay in the black, here.

657
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,733
We think we can do better.

658
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:30,029
Bringing in our own girls,
move our own products,

659
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,905
wash our own money.

660
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:34,909
We're going to be doing a lot
of business in California now.

661
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:40,998
Good for you.

662
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:44,793
I tell you, hindsight,

663
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:47,211
I was out of my element
with that land stuff.

664
00:42:47,212 --> 00:42:48,673
Stick to what you know, right?

665
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:52,760
I must say, you're taking this
better than expected.

666
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,055
Is Mr. Churchman around?
Blake?

667
00:42:57,056 --> 00:43:00,727
Shit, no. Guy's been around
less the last three months

668
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,728
than my wife's period.

669
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:06,315
You know, Frank, my board,

670
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:09,401
they thought we should
take you out.

671
00:43:09,402 --> 00:43:13,822
I said, "Frank Semyon
understands business.

672
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:15,073
He'll adjust."

673
00:43:15,074 --> 00:43:18,244
So what are my prospects?
Straight up.

674
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,082
You can manage the day-to-day of
the casino and the club.

675
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,125
We put you on salary.

676
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:27,503
I said,
"Frank knows clubs."

677
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:32,592
I had ideas of getting
out of this, you know.

678
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:35,802
There's no such thing
for you, Frank.

679
00:43:35,803 --> 00:43:39,181
That world isn't yours.
You manage clubs.

680
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:42,101
In time, we find
something new to build on.

681
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:46,271
Well, what can I say to that?

682
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:49,775
After all, no fighting
what you can't change.

683
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:54,488
Look, I ain't lasted this
long without some knowledge

684
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:56,281
of my own limitations.

685
00:43:56,282 --> 00:44:00,035
And it is my hope
that we can fucking build on this.

686
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,621
Going into the future.

687
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:19,179
- Velcoro.
- <i> What's up, man?</i>

688
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,807
I wanted to call.

689
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:24,726
I think--

690
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:28,397
I ain't told anybody
about this other...

691
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:31,358
thing.

692
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,653
<i>But somebody sent me</i>
<i>these pictures.</i>

693
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:36,196
<i>Pictures of me.</i>

694
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:37,906
What, of our thing?

695
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,868
<i>No, it's something else.</i>
<i>This is mine.</i>

696
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:45,623
I think I might be walking
into something.

697
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,835
<i>Then don't.</i>

698
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:54,590
- I'll call you back.
- <i> Listen, hold on. Wait...</i>

699
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:09,020
What the fuck is this?

700
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:12,107
Orders.
I gotta take your gun.

701
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,610
Don't make a thing of it.
You've got eyes all over you.

702
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,704
Come on,
I can get you through this.

703
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:29,124
Black Mountain?

704
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,251
Not anymore.

705
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:32,918
Ares Security.
We rebranded.

706
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:35,881
We just service one client now--
Catalast Group.

707
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:43,180
When you got in touch,
what was that?

708
00:45:43,181 --> 00:45:45,807
I had orders to check on you.

709
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,560
After all that press stuff,

710
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:50,896
make sure you kept
confidentiality.

711
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:55,818
This is your situation.
I didn't make it.

712
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,779
Let's go.

713
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,782
<i>They just want to talk.</i>

714
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,758
That was Woodrugh.

715
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:21,885
Something's up with him.

716
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:24,471
- What?
- I don't know.

717
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:26,264
He said he'd call me back.

718
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:29,934
We need an exit strategy.
Get out of the country.

719
00:46:29,935 --> 00:46:32,855
There's no way
they'll let us go to trial.

720
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,899
<i>You hear me?</i>

721
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,277
Vera said this girl's
name was Laura.

722
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:41,613
Does she look--
she look familiar?

723
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:44,115
I swear,
there's something--

724
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:47,036
No.
Her name is Erica.

725
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:51,623
From the city manager's office.

726
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:53,750
She was Caspere's secretary.

727
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:55,709
- You met her on the movie set.
- Yeah.

728
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,754
Woodrugh said
one of the orphans in that robbery,

729
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:00,633
- her name was Laura.
- Laura.

730
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,845
- Ooh.
- You got it?

731
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:07,972
Yeah, it's here.

732
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:10,226
Let me see.

733
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:14,063
I don't know.
What do you think?

734
00:47:36,252 --> 00:47:39,296
You've been looking
for information about me, son.

735
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:42,007
Well, here's
your chance to ask.

736
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:49,974
All right, Mr. Patterson.
Thank you.

737
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:53,936
No, this was very helpful.

738
00:47:55,646 --> 00:47:58,107
Moved out of her apartment
six weeks ago.

739
00:47:58,149 --> 00:48:00,234
Quit the city manager's
office around that time.

740
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:03,152
Woodrugh could do a trace on her.
Credit cards, whatever.

741
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:04,655
Figure out where she went.

742
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:08,117
Let's try him again.
Voicemail.

743
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:14,080
What now?

744
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:17,042
Ride it out till morning.

745
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:21,922
Guess we'll wait for Woodrugh.

746
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:35,976
We got a gas leak
spilling into the AC.

747
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:38,228
Need to clear the place
for three hours or so.

748
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:40,858
- Are you serious?
- Just fucking do it.

749
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,568
Everybody out.

750
00:48:47,823 --> 00:48:51,283
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a sudden safety issue,

751
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:54,330
<i>we need to request that</i>
<i>you cash out your chips</i>

752
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,457
<i>and vacate the premises.</i>

753
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:02,378
These tunnels exist
under the entire city.

754
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:05,381
Most people don't know that.

755
00:49:05,382 --> 00:49:10,178
The pictures of you two
were a happy coincidence

756
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:13,432
we came across when clearing
Detective Dixon's apartment.

757
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:17,727
Apparently he was
keeping an eye on you.

758
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,938
Teague always had
a nose for secrets.

759
00:49:20,939 --> 00:49:22,689
If you had just been honest
about who you are,

760
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,443
nobody'd be able to run you.

761
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:28,697
<i>- You know that, right?</i>
- And this is what?

762
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:31,784
Some documents were stolen
from a private gathering

763
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:34,452
of citizens in Monterey.

764
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:37,080
I believe you have
these documents.

765
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:38,791
Do not bother lying.

766
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:42,460
Not on me.

767
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:44,337
Mm-mm.

768
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:47,007
Velcoro?
Bezzerides?

769
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,551
Where are they?

770
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:54,055
- I don't know.
- Oh.

771
00:49:54,056 --> 00:49:57,309
Velcoro has the papers.
He's turning them into the feds.

772
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:05,566
But I can call him.

773
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,903
We set up a meeting.

774
00:50:09,655 --> 00:50:11,864
But I skate.

775
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,827
And I get every fucking
copy of those pictures.

776
00:50:14,828 --> 00:50:18,037
That's accommodating.
Maybe too much.

777
00:50:18,038 --> 00:50:20,540
Velcoro don't mean shit to me.

778
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,542
This fuck-up
dragging down.

779
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:24,502
He had me look you up.

780
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:26,713
Davis used all of us
and she's fucking dead.

781
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:28,756
The other, this Ventura dyke,

782
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:31,259
she's been on my ass
from the jump.

783
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,637
I could give a shit
about either of them.

784
00:50:35,347 --> 00:50:38,475
Call Ray.
Set a meeting.

785
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:55,950
Osip wants to know
where is gas leak.

786
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:57,410
It's...

787
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,985
I'm just tired.

788
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,612
<i>There.</i>

789
00:51:32,613 --> 00:51:33,945
I want to go to bed now.

790
00:51:33,946 --> 00:51:35,449
That's "Splendor
in the Grass."

791
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:39,201
I love that one.

792
00:51:39,202 --> 00:51:42,914
<i>You tell Bud Stamper</i>
<i>to bring you home earlier.</i>

793
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:44,874
Looks old.

794
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,460
It is.

795
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:49,420
Sad.

796
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:52,299
<i>Good night, sleep tight,</i>
<i>don't let the bed bugs bite.</i>

797
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,926
<i>Good night.</i>

798
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,640
I don't get
any service down here.

799
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:05,645
- Let me see. Ah!
- Hey, hey!

800
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:08,607
Oh, boy, you fucking up.
Cut the shit, son.

801
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:10,232
Shut up.

802
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,361
Toss all the guns.
Kill the fucking lights.

803
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,154
- Now!
- Do it.

804
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:16,781
Now...

805
00:52:16,782 --> 00:52:18,866
Kick 'em forward.

806
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:20,243
Move.

807
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,070
This is gonna be
hard on my son.

808
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:58,073
The things he'll hear about me.

809
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,991
We can get out of this.

810
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:04,704
We get that girl's story,
walk her into the feds.

811
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:06,748
Fucking CNN.

812
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,170
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,299
I brought you back in this.

814
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,385
No, I made a choice.

815
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,515
A long time ago.

816
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:27,768
I, uh...

817
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:32,190
I thought everything
came from something else.

818
00:53:35,652 --> 00:53:37,737
But it came from there.

819
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:43,743
You had something
like that, too, once, right?

820
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,421
It's not something
I talk about.

821
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:57,340
Well...

822
00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:01,678
It's one of the things
I admire about you.

823
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:10,747
You're not a bad man.

824
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:18,254
Yes...

825
00:55:21,174 --> 00:55:22,759
I am.

826
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:36,898
Do you miss it?

827
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:41,944
What?

828
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,869
Anything?

829
01:01:46,392 --> 01:01:49,729
Fuck you.
No, no.

830
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,689
No. Fuck you.

831
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:02,158
<i>Oh, what a fine boy you are.</i>

832
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:14,376
<i>So now we're
expecting another child.</i>

833
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:16,338
<i>I hope it's a girl this time.</i>

834
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,216
<i>You're a fine boy.</i>

835
01:02:24,638 --> 01:02:26,389
<i>Well, I have to go now.</i>

836
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:29,433
<i>Oh. You'll come
back again sometime?</i>

837
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:31,020
<i>Will you come back for dinner?</i>

838
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:20,486
