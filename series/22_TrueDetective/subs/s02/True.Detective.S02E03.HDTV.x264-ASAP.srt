You call me you got something.

90
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:37,240
Well, I got shot.
That's something.

91
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,077
I found our murder scene.
That's something else.

92
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,879
You don't enter a scene
without your partner-- me.

93
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,414
I didn't know it was a scene.

94

I walk in, next thing
somebody shotgunned me.

95
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,886
- Twice.
- Then how are you still--

96
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:52,422
Rubber buckshot.
It's just impact.

97
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:54,091

100
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,735
Couple of cracked ribs.

101
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,604
Took one in the sternum,
so my heart aches.

102
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,690
And how did you
find this place?

103
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:12,075
Prost tip through a CI.

104
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,244

took her here once.

105
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:19,249
All right.
Well, get cleared by a doctor.

106
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:21,284
See if you can
bring in the hooker.

107
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,502
Fuck, it smells like piss.

108
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:25,005
Burris is already inside.

00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:30,043

Vinci PD Special Homicide Task Force.

111
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,555
What are you doing
with my scene, Lieutenant?

112
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:44,358
Securing it.

113
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:48,228

you better believe I'm on site.

121
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:01,384
This never happened to me
in my fucking life.

122
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:10,277

a room nearby.

123
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,978
Take our time.

124
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,698

Don't fuck up."

130
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,997
Baby, just relax.

131
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,083

133
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,838

134
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,306
A lot.

135
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,841
It's unnatural.

136
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,009

137
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:45,929

00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,782
Or maybe Caspere
was into so much dirt,

184
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,918
there's no telling
which side the ax came from,

185
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:57,537
because let me tell you,
there was some fucked-up psychology at work

186
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,756
in that place before
it was a murder scene.

187
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:04,878
Now, are you gonna tell me
what Caspere was doing with you

188
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,130
or do I wait to walk
into another dark room,

189
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,182
this time with real bullets?

190
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:12,218
There's a certain
stridency at work here.

191
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,521
I'm gonna put it off
to you getting blasted.

192
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:18,274
Oh, frankly, I'm apoplectic.

193
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,194
I'm feeling a little
apoplectic myself.

194
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,165
What's with the water?

195
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:45,835
Booze tends to take the edge off.
I want to stay angry.

196
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:54,511
Caspere had a lot
of my money in play.

197
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,262
Real estate.

198
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,565
Property adjacent
to the rail line.

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,818
How long did you know him?

200
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,022
Started working with him
the last few years.

201
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,525
He was here when we moved
out of the city.

202
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,494
They stole a hidden camera

203
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,830
after they shot me.

204
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:17,834
Hard drive.
Boggles the mind what might be on it.

205
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,092
Like I said,
I'm gonna put off the stridency.

206
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,712
Well, you do that, Frank.

207
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,722
Is Ray hurt?
What happened?

208
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,942
Somebody murdered him.

209
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,867
The mayor of Vinci
lives in Bel-Air?

210
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,299
<i>Are you Betty Chessani?</i>

211
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:11,471
We're state police, ma'am.

212
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,506
Veronica Chessani.

213
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:16,309
I'm Betty's stepmother.

214
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:19,596
Mrs. Chessani, do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

215
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:23,900
Did you know Ben Caspere,
the Vinci city manager?

216
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,518
Only a little.

217
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,238
A dinner party I meet him once.

218
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,823
<i>You guys have</i>
<i>a party last night?</i>

219
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,608
No.

220
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,535
Is medicine for my eyes.

221
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,958
Hello.

222
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:57,050
Do you remember Mr. Caspere
and your husband

223
00:14:57,102 --> 00:14:58,718
ever talking late at night?

224
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,437
No, I don't think.

225
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:03,690
Have you talked to Austin?

226
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,942
He say okay
for you coming here?

227
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:07,977
- Sure.
- Oh.

228
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:09,479
We're checking
because Mr. Caspere

229
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:12,198
kept an apartment in the city

230
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,651
and his phone records
show a lot of phone calls

231
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,369
coming to this house.

232
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,488
1:00, 2:00 AM.

233
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,374
I-- I don't--
I don't know.

234
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,243
I don't pay attention.

235
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:26,162
Is upstairs line.
Business.

236
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,803
<i>So how long have you been</i>
<i>married to Mr. Chessani?</i>

237
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,555
Mayor Chessani.

238
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,840
<i>Never mister,</i>

239
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,842
<i>he says.</i>

240
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,144
For a year.

241
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,930
And how'd you guys meet?

242
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:48,318
A party.

243
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:32,862
Hey.

244
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,614
Everything all right?

245
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,793
And stay down there, you dumb bitch.

246
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:53,216
I tell you to keep
these whores from my house.

247
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:03,059
Yo, Ronnie,
who the fuck these people?

248
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,146
State police.
Cover yourself.

249
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,400
Got a warrant?

250
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,693
Why you hurt me like this, huh?

251
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,079
Yo, why don't you
chug a pot of coffee?

252
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,331
Take a Xanax
and chill your ass.

253
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,952
Bodine on his way down.
I called him.

254
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,372
People ain't happy
with y'all goose-stepping up in here.

255
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,290
You knew Ben Caspere?

256
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,260
Nah, some old guy
who worked with my pops.

257
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,799
No! No! No!

258
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:45,435
Who left door open?

259
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,856
Where'd you pick up
that accent?

260
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,357
Accent?

261
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,360
You racist woman.
Mm-mm.

262
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,234
I admit, it's a total put-on.

263
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,569
Different roles
for different jobs.

264
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,238
I have a lot of friends.

265
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,956
And what is it you do?

266
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,991
Specialty events.

267
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:11,044
I am an organizer.

268
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,829
What kind of events?

269
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:15,498
All kinds.

270
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,583
Now, if you'll excuse me...

271
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,086
y'all best to
get stepping 'fore my man Bodine

272
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:23,056
come in here with a lawyer,
chew your asses out.

273
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,675
You ain't got no jurisdiction
coming in here.

274
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,770
Burst capillaries,
cholesterol terrible,

275
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:39,522
<i>your liver is redlining.</i>

276
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:42,692
<i>Can I ask how much you
drink in an average week?</i>

277
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:44,994
All I can.

278
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,996
<i>Drugs?</i>

279
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:48,498
A few.

280
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,416
And I'll just go out
on a limb here

281
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:53,336
and guess that your diet
isn't particularly healthy.

282
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,872
Well, this,

283
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:59,959
you know, had me
thinking about, uh...

284
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,594
changing some things.

285
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:05,264
<i>Well, it's certainly possible</i>
<i>to live with unhealthy habits,</i>

286
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,101
but it helps if you don't
have every one under the sun.

287
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:10,603
Am I cleared?

288
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,271
<i>I'd take a couple days,</i>

289
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,557
<i>but, yeah, you're cleared.</i>

290
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,526
Burris says to clear
you at any rate.

291
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:19,061
Great.
All right, see you.

292
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,064
Can I ask you something,
Mr. Velcoro?

293
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,450
<i>Do you want to live?</i>

294
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,585
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

295
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,420
<i>Vertical mall.</i>

296
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,755
<i>What do you need, Frank?</i>

297
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,591
Gratitude, for starters.

298
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,594
Frank, you know I'm grateful.

299
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:52,812
I've told you.

300
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,647
Gratitude you can count.

301
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:59,519
Frank, what I pulled together
to take your shares back,

302
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:02,155
no one else would have
paid what I did.

303
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,574
And I'm grateful

304
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,526
with the rail corridor stuff.

305
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,027
It's great.

306
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,579
Thank you.

307
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,833
How many times do you expect
to be paid for the same thing?

308
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,868
Every month.

309
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,787
25% of your net.

310
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,706
I-- I already paid you.
Come on, man.

311
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:22,341
You moved on.

312
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:25,294
Things change.

313
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:29,298
If they change for me,
they can change for you.

314
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,269
Things are good right now.

315
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,438
That's good.

316
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:39,976
Maybe one day the Teamsters,
your electrical workers,

317
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,894
they get a problem
with this site.

318
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:44,730
Probity Loan that
loaned you that money

319
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:47,316
that lets you buy
into this gravy train,

320
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:49,318
they're gonna
call back the note

321
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,537
and you'll need a friend,

322
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:54,407
which is what I'm offering you.

323
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,742
How's Mary and the boys?

324
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,377
She stood by you, huh?

325
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,665
You like the schools
in Tarzana?

326
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,841
I want weekend deliveries.

327
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,392
And those electrician fucks,

328
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:16,062
they're charging me for five
guys when three will do.

329
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:17,763
There you go.

330
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:20,182
One hand in the other.

331
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,852
First of the month, Bart.

332
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:25,187
I'm not going anywhere.

333
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:45,374
<i>He had a safe-deposit box
at a Bel-Air security firm.</i>

334
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:50,880
<i>Articles of incorporation</i>
<i>for a couple LLCs.</i>

335
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:53,883
These corporations he had
formed within the last year.

336
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,851
We're looking into
asset listings now.

337
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,888
Good. They can use that
to follow his money.

338
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,439
No closer on a suspect?

339
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,691
Velcoro didn't see
who shot him?

340
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:02,692
Said they were masked.

341
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,027
You think he could
have staged that?

342
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:08,064
I mean, at the end of the day,
he just got banged up some.

343
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:13,819
Can't imagine why he would.

344
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,574
There was something else
in that box, too.

345
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,078
<i>Blue diamonds.</i>

346
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,746
We'll follow up
on the corporate holdings

347
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,214
and the prostitution
connections

348
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,383
while the lab processes
the apartment.

349
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:30,086
Caspere seems deep
with Catalast.

350
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:33,222
Nothing much public on them.
Own a lot of land.

351
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,558
Gotten close to Velcoro?

352
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:37,259
- My impression?
- Mm.

353
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,811
- Straight up?
- Mm.

354
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:41,897
Guy's a burnout.

355
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:46,018
Bitch comes into my house,
no warrant, no nothing,

356
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,356
harasses my wife, my children.

357
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:53,075
The mayor is very upset.

358
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,944
What did you find, Ray?

359
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:58,080
A murder scene in an
apartment in West Hollywood.

360
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:02,868
This private development group
Catalast rented it for Caspere.

361
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,503
And?

362
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,839
Oh, same kinds of weirdness
we found at his other place.

363
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,290
You know, his fetish shit.

364
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:11,177
And there was a spot where a
camera and a hard drive had been,

365
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:13,212
<i>but the guy</i>
<i>that shot me took it.</i>

366
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:15,131
And you didn't get
a look at him?

367
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:19,051
No. As soon as I turned,
I just saw the blast.

368
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:20,970
What about the cunt?

369
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:25,191
Bezzerides. She ask any
questions about the department?

370
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,476
No, not really.

371
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:31,280
<i>Velcoro's dirty.
I want him.</i>

372
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:33,449
<i>I thought I was clear on that.</i>

373
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:35,484
We got a crooked
Vinci cop we can leverage.

374
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,570
All the better.

375
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,705
He's a man, for Christ's sake.

376
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:42,324
Yeah, so what?

377
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:47,163
I'm not saying fuck him, but maybe
let him think you might fuck him.

378
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:50,166
Detective Bezzerides
isn't IA or UC.

379
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:52,334
<i>She's tasked with a murder.</i>

380
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:53,669
Sure. Sure.

381
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,338
And I'm not putting
this in a memo,

382
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:59,258
but Velcoro is worth a bonus.

383
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,011
<i>I can see working</i>
<i>a promotion for you.</i>

384
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,698
State attorney subpoenaed
our time sheets.

385
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,817
- Hmm.
- What's your next move on Caspere?

386
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:09,702
- Well--
<i>- I want her badge.</i>

387
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:13,155
I want her hick
sheriff boss's badge.

388
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,325
This state thing is gonna
get cleared up soon enough.

389
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,828
They're gonna come out
owing me and that--

390
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,797
that cunt is walking the plank.

391
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,166
Look, the camera taken means
there was something on it.

392
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:26,168
Maybe the killing,
maybe footage of the killer.

393
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:29,255
But he was traveling up and down
the state doing land deals.

394
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,641
Well, that's smoke and no fire.

395
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:34,393
Land deals aren't
gonna bring this in.

396
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,179
But keep working the hooker
angle and get it wrapped

397
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,849
before state makes this
part of their probe.

398
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,319
Clear?

399
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:45,021
Um...

400
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,189
Bezzerides is running
the case, sir.

401
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:49,825
Bezzerides is gonna be
running a yogurt stand.

402
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:53,579
So steer her
to something concrete.

403
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:56,165
I like a pimp for this.

404
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,034
Look, you want the truth?

405
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:01,203
Maybe this is a good
excuse to take me off.

406
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:03,039
You know?

407
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:05,625
I mean, she don't trust me.

408
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:07,793
And I ain't ever
exactly been Columbo.

409
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:10,129
What the fuck does that mean?

410
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,632
This is your best man?

411
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:14,550
You're on it, Ray, period.

412
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:18,220
How's the, uh, probe looking?

413
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:23,559
We'll work it out.

414
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,695
Yeah.

415
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:36,238
They treating you all right?

416
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,075
Like a cheerleader
on an oil rig.

417
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:42,495
Oh, shit.

418
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:44,997
Hey, thought your phone
was busted.

419
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,750
- I heard you were up here.
I thought I'd stop by. - Okay, yeah.

420
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:49,251
I've just-- I've been
working down south.

421
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,636
No, yeah, I know.
I know.

422
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:52,972
I just thought maybe
we could go grab a bite.

423
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,508
Ahem.
I can come down,

424
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,760
you know, since you're not
answering my phone calls.

425
00:25:57,762 --> 00:26:00,813
Yeah, Steve, look,
you're a decent guy, but--

426
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:03,316
- Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
- This has run its course.

427
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:04,850
Okay?

428
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:06,686
No big deal.
You didn't do anything.

429
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:10,189
But you and I,
there's just not much there.

430
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:13,192
There's not much there?

431
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:15,277
Well, you could have fooled me.

432
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,366
You know, you fucking
started this.

433
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:22,618
Don't push this somewhere ugly.

434
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,454
Just be a little
mature about it.

435
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,957
- Have some dignity.
- Dignity?

436
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:33,379
You're a real suck 'em
and leave 'em type, huh?

437
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,966
You talk to me like that again,

438
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:40,302
you're gonna need a little
baggie to carry your teeth home.

439
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:53,032
- Mama's boy.
- What?

440
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:56,535
Stop. Stop. Get the fuck
out of my squad room.

441
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:02,491
All right.

442
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:06,379
You know, you got serious
problems, Detective.

443
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:08,247
I'm whittling them down.

444
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:13,135
- Wow.
- Yeah?

445
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,670
- Nice.
- You got something to say?

446
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:17,006
Nothing at all.

447
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,187
Ah!

448
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,023
You could just drink
from the bottle.

449
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:37,109
Drink out the bottle,
you got a problem.

450
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:43,082
You know that last shit you
gave me kept me up all night.

451
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:45,084
<i>Thought I could</i>
<i>hear your mother.</i>

452
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,086
Well, not that.
It's indica.

453
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:50,039
<i>The smell of burning flesh.
Your own.</i>

454
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,757
Well, then talk! What did
you do with the stuff?

455
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:54,960
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Louis is okay.

456
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:58,714
I had a dream

457
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:00,216
about you.

458
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:03,018
<i>I can't ever</i>
<i>remember my dreams.</i>

459
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,804
Barely sleep anyway.

460
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:14,280
Where's your badge?

461
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,283
Well, it's...

462
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:31,497
You shouldn't do that.

463
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,833
Whatever you saw on the news
or whatever pissed you off,

464
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,251
you'll wake up one day
and you'll miss it.

465
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:37,553
I won't miss it.

466
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,089
There ain't no PD anymore.

467
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:42,558
Well, if you're gonna throw
it away, I'll take it.

468
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,593
I'll give it to Chad.

469
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:51,267
Pull. Have you got any
friends with push like that?

470
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:54,069
You been eating?

471
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:56,739
Nah, I don't get hungry.

472
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:59,241
Well, that grass
will give you an appetite.

473
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,160
Put you to sleep, too.

474
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,950
Mm.

475
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,368
How's your boy?

476
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,421
He's all right.

477
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:15,040
It's hard being a kid.

478
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:17,843
We don't see each other
as much as we'd like.

479
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:25,184
Pop, the guys in Vinci, you
knew Kevin Burris a little.

480
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,685
Holloway the chief?

481
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,104
Holloway's a good man.

482
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,557
Hard charger.

483
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,309
Old school.

484
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:36,312
Worked them tough beats
under Gates.

485
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:40,065
Back when you could
actually do police work.

486
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:44,954
Yeah, Burris, too.

487
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:47,072
Why'd he leave?

488
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,158
Set up shop in Vinci?

489
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,410
'Cause he's fucking smart.

490
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,797
Then after the riots and OJ,

491
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:57,633
we just couldn't
do the job right.

492
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,169
So he said so long
to those cunts

493
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:02,338
and, phew...

494
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,506
headed on out of town.

495
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:08,727
I should have been
looking ahead.

496
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,933
Wouldn't have
no half pension now.

497
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:18,771
Anyways, I hadn't
seen you in a while.

498
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:20,272
Yeah.

499
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,690
I figured you needed
your medicine.

500
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:24,910
Look at that shit.

501
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,996
Kirk Douglas.

502
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:33,035
No country for white men, boy.

503
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,873
I guess I'll take off, then.

504
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,442
I don't get it.

505
00:30:56,477 --> 00:31:00,396
We'll be in Vegas for a few days.
I have other business.

506
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,532
Gives me time to confer
with my people.

507
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:06,952
We can talk next week.

508
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:09,538
A month ago it sounded
like we were a done deal.

509
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,490
We've been over this, Frank.

510
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:14,410
I don't make
these decisions myself.

511
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:16,629
And Caspere?

512
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:21,000
My thinking is this is somehow
connected to you getting cold feet.

513
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:24,753
Sure.
We're not stupid.

514
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:28,507
What you had sewn up,
the stitching's frayed, Frank.

515
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:33,595
This is too big
to walk away from.

516
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,849
I don't ask permission.

517
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:39,435
I wasn't talking about you.

518
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:43,105
You leaving?
Bon fucking voyage.

519
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:47,159
All right, Frank.

520
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,506
Fucking Commie Jew fuck.

521
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,096
Where's Blake?

522
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:08,681
I messaged him.

523
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:22,194
And Stan--
why isn't he here?

524
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:24,980
Shouldn't
a reasonable man infer

525
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:27,533
from Osip's arrival
and departure

526
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:29,868
and fucking failure
to make good on our terms

527
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:32,821
as being connected
not just to Caspere,

528
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:35,157
but prefiguring Caspere?

529
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,826
In a causal sense.

530
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,995
I'm saying...

531
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:42,381
do you think Osip
could have done Caspere?

532
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,466
Not my department.

533
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:50,005
But if you're asking me
is he that kind of guy,

534
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:54,893
he looks half anaconda
and half great white.

535
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,503
So I saw that paper, bro.

536
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:06,839
Thought I'd check up on you.

537
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:08,707
<i>Got you downrange, huh?</i>

538
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,293
It's bullshit.

539
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:14,213
I'm half working
this thing for state.

540
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,131
Supposed to see me through.

541
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:18,300
So?

542
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:21,520
So fuck no, I didn't.

543
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:23,972
Yeah, well,
I didn't think you did.

544
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,526
So you been going to meetings?

545
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,479
I went the first year.

546
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:33,982
I mean, if you want
to get over something,

547
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:36,201
maybe sitting around
and remembering it

548
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,871
in every detail

549
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:40,906
ain't the right way.

550
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,408
Yeah, well, the thing of it is

551
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,411
some of that knowledge
they spill makes sense.

552
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,382
Stuff about the past,

553
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,501
not denying it...

554
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,470
letting it be a part of you.

555
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:00,008
Yeah.

556
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:03,762
You working?

557
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:06,982
Yeah, just some things
here and there.

558
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:12,604
Mm, I got on with
the electricians union.

559
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:15,023
- Mm, great.
- Still a low man.

560
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,745
You ever miss it?

561
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,580
Yeah.

562
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:26,868
You know, I keep thinking
about the village.

563
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,955
Outside Al Awjar.

564
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,592
The valley.

565
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,378
Nice people, man.

566
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,297
Mountains.

567
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:41,600
We ain't soldiers anymore, man.

568
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:44,386
I remember thinking

569
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,605
I could have just stayed there.

570
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:50,559
Just forget finding the squad.

571
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:54,396
I mean...

572
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,116
I think, like,
that was like the--

573
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:02,904
it was the last time
shit felt right for me, bro.

574
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:04,573
You mean combat.

575
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,630
Would you ever go back to it?

576
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:13,715
I don't think so.

577
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:15,717
Didn't think I'd stay on
as long as I did.

578
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:18,971
And then it was hard to see
coming home, you know?

579
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:22,507
That's not what I mean.

580
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,309
You know
what I'm talking about.

581
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:26,228
Them three days.

582
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:29,398
- I think about you, man.
- Stop it.

583
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:32,601
Why? What if I don't
want to forget, huh?

584
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:37,773
Dude, you should go.

585
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,276
- I'm out.
- Hey, look.

586
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:43,528
Don't pretend, all right?
Don't pre--

587
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,364
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
You see that?</i>

588
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,366
Fuck you, asshole.

589
00:35:47,418 --> 00:35:50,669
Woodrugh, I'm sorry, man.

590
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:57,376
I didn't mean for that.

591
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,796
I'm sorry, man.
I'm drunk.

592
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:03,515
I am drunk.
I'm sorry.

593
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,117
City traffic cams came back.

594
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:24,786
Ventura picked this one up
1:00 AM night of the murder.

595
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:26,988
<i>Caddy pulling onto PCH</i>
<i>from the 33.</i>

596
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,958
<i>Car's registered to a film
transportation department.</i>

597
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:31,993
That flick
they're shooting here?

598
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,412
Got it in one.

599
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:44,673
You're back.

600
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:47,008
Yeah, not for lack of trying.

601
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:56,818
<i>Caspere arranged
our tax incentives.</i>

602
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,187
<i>Only way you can film</i>
<i>anything in California now.</i>

603
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,026
Threw him a coproducer credit.

604
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:03,064
We're real sorry to
hear what happened.

605
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:03,889
Cut!

606
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:05,699
- Was he around here much?
- No.

607
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,955
I mean, he came by--

608
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:10,365
we were in prep,
helped out with PD, zoning.

609
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,367
That producer credit
come with a paycheck?

610
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:14,002
Back end, yeah.

611
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:15,871
What about that car?
The Caddy?

612
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,589
<i>Went missing</i>
<i>one morning last week.</i>

613
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:19,091
We filed it stolen
with sheriff's.

614
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,842
Put in the insurance
papers yesterday.

615
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:24,112
I'll bring you
to our transpo head.

616
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:25,714
<i>Yeah, Monday
morning it was gone.</i>

617
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,215
<i>Lock on the gate was bolt cut.</i>

618
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,717
Sheriff's took a report.

619
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,185
Any personnel missing?

620
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,971
No, nothing unusual.

621
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:36,224
We had a driver quit the week
before due to family issues.

622
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:38,860
I never knew the Caspere guy.

623
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:42,114
I need names and addresses of
everyone in your department.

624
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:45,450
Sure. Yeah.

625
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:50,489
Cut.
Fuck it.

626
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,074
Check the gate.
Let's move.

627
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,748
Hey, what's this thing about?

628
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,716
About two tons of shit.

629
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:07,973
Some collapse of
civilization revenge flick.

630
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:11,426
Ought to make it a silent picture
the way the guy does his lines.

631
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:14,596
- That's your job?
- Yeah, set photographer.

632
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:20,769
It's the best use
of my time so far.

633
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,771
You ever--

634
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:25,357
you ever seen this guy around?

635
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:28,026
Yeah, I've seen him.

636
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:29,411
Some city guy.

637
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:32,330
Wants to brush shoulders
with the industry, I guess.

638
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:34,282
Heard he partied with
our director once or twice.

639
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:36,084
Oh, yeah?

640
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,788
Yeah, Daisun was going on
about some party they went to.

641
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,958
Well-attended, he said.

642
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,544
I mean pussy.
Like, wall to wall.

643
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:49,464
I guess being the set photographer
don't rate an invite.

644
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:52,884
Yeah, it was just like
a dinner, drinks thing.

645
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:55,887
Lots of suits,
potential investors.

646
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:57,355
What about girls?

647
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,975
Yeah, girls were there.

648
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,726
They are over half
the population.

649
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:03,728
Were there any hookers
at this party?

650
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,814
I really wouldn't
know that, ma'am.

651
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:08,650
- Hmm.
- Where was it?

652
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:10,702
Somewhere up above Ventura.

653
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:12,654
I really don't remember.

654
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:15,907
Tell you the truth, I drink.

655
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:19,411
So it makes
my recollection unreliable.

656
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,963
Jack, get everyone up
for a rehearsal.

657
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:25,050
I'll be there in a sec.
Burning dollars.

658
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:27,002
Yeah.

659
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:35,894
<i>I still work for the
city manager's office.</i>

660
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:38,847
With Mr. Caspere--

661
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,348
with what happened,

662
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,318
they sent me down to collect
copies of the tax agreements.

663
00:39:43,353 --> 00:39:45,437
Why? Something
wrong with them?

664
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,522
I don't think so.

665
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:50,659
They're just trying to get all
the city's paperwork in order.

666
00:39:50,694 --> 00:39:52,694
With the state's inquiry.

667
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,282
All right.

668
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,783
Thank you.

669
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:07,175
The fuck have you been?

670
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,711
You take off on me now?

671
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,380
Just with my lady.

672
00:40:12,432 --> 00:40:14,883
- My-- my phone died.
- Your fucking phone died?

673
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,718
Am I a goddamn teenage girl?

674
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,554
Frank, Stan.

675
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:22,107
What about him?

676
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:24,025
He's dead.

677
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:30,899
Couple of our Mexicans
found him, boss.

678
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,202
What is this, huh?

679
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,907
Who the fuck would have
something against Stan?

680
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:43,461
<i>Don't make any fucking sense.</i>

681
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:46,131
What is he to anybody?

682
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:49,301
Too much coming
right after Caspere.

683
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,722
No shit.

684
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,926
Who, huh?

685
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,566
Who the fuck's coming after me?

686
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,102
Huh? Who?

687
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:15,110
Get Santos, Fregredo,
Constantine,

688
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:16,778
anybody that works

689
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,414
or what used to be
our property now tonight!

690
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,117
Santos' place.

691
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,618
What are you thinking?

692
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,670
Just fucking do what I tell ya.

693
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:31,960
Pack him up.

694
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:35,847
He deserves better than this.

695
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:49,644
How you guys doing?

696
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:54,899

697

Mm-mm.

698

No?

709
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:09,190
I've seen him before.

710
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,060
Where?

711
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:15,396
Never dated him, I mean,

712
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:18,867
but he'd been around
a few times.

713
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:20,368
I was working.

714
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:21,903
Good with faces.

715
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,040
Where was this?

716
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:29,994
Couple times, this club
a couple blocks down.

717
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:32,080
Lux Infinitum.

718
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:33,748
<i>You been there?</i>

719
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,416
No.

720
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:39,471
Is it big with hookers?

721
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,339
Big with all sorts.

722
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:44,893
<i>But, yeah, they got</i>
<i>some prime time in there.</i>

723
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:47,428
It's one of them
circuit clubs, you know?

724
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:50,398
Trade runs through.

725
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,600
Some European.

726
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,936
That pussy is expensive, so...

727
00:43:54,988 --> 00:43:57,188
<i>yeah, you got party people,</i>

728
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:59,741
<i>but also suits and whatnot.</i>

729
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,746
All right.

730
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:06,498
Thanks.

731
00:44:09,786 --> 00:44:12,120
They're not gonna talk to you.

732
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,842
They probably wouldn't
even let you in.

733
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:21,713
This angsty cop drama
you're rolling.

734
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:39,814
You like models, I guess?

735
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:44,202
Yeah, started building
them with my kid.

736
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:46,654
Then I just started
doing them without him.

737
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:49,157
Thanks.

738
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,049
Shit.

739
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,170
Just a minute.

740
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:09,978
Hey.

741
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:16,651
Look, Ray, I, uh--

742
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:19,404
I just wanted
to see about Chad.

743
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:21,906
Yeah, I don't want to
repeat that conversation.

744
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:24,442
I don't want to do that.

745
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:27,528
I think you've got
worse trouble.

746
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:29,914
State police officers
came to see us.

747
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:34,535
Investigators, two of them.

748
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,123
Wanted to know about you.

749
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:41,092
Wanted to know what?

750
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:44,045
If I ever saw extra cash
you couldn't account for.

751
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:48,049
If I had ever known you
to be violent.

752
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:50,101
If I, uh...

753
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:54,974
ever knew or suspected

754
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:57,992
you took retribution on
the man who attacked me.

755
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,983
It's 10,000.

756
00:46:06,703 --> 00:46:08,953
For what?

757
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:10,622
To not contest the custody.

758
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:17,128
We just-- we just want to
do what's best for Chad.

759
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:23,751
You think you can buy my son?

760
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:27,388
No, it's for...

761
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:31,926
it's to just go, Ray.

762
00:46:31,928 --> 00:46:33,928
It's an alternative.

763
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:35,596
Go somewhere.

764
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:40,768
Before we can't turn back.

765
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:44,155
Whatever happens,
those questions,

766
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,441
a custody battle,

767
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:48,359
it's not gonna
be easy for Chad.

768
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:50,828
So don't start it.

769
00:46:50,864 --> 00:46:53,665
The way those two
investigators sounded,

770
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,700
it's a matter of time, Ray.

771
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:04,792
You put that envelope away.

772
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:07,261
I'm gonna pretend like you never
really thought I'd take it.

773
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:09,630
I didn't.

774
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:11,716
But I hoped I might be wrong.

775
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,540
- You all right?
- Yeah.

776
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:40,128
Yeah, we should
get back to work.

777
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:24,122
Yeah, he liked it here.

778
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,457
One of them older guys,
never left the bar,

779
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:28,176
just wait for the girl
to walk up.

780
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:29,761
Thank you.

781
00:48:29,796 --> 00:48:32,430
You know anyone
he ever left with?

782
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:34,799
Uh, a few of the girls
here for sure,

783
00:48:34,851 --> 00:48:36,184
but I wouldn't try
talking to them.

784
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,219
You'd just get them
into trouble.

785
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:44,475
- He like boys?
- More like he likes to watch.

786
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:47,695
Had me and this girl
go at it while he sat in the corner.

787
00:48:48,898 --> 00:48:50,698
You do girls.

788
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:53,234
In a pinch.
With the right medication.

789
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:02,376
Who's this girl?

790
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,465
Fuck.

791
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,803
Her name's Tascha.

792
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:13,588
She's one of them Euro tricks.

793
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,007
Hasn't been around lately.

794
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:19,260
One of those elite bitches,
worked those private parties.

795
00:49:19,262 --> 00:49:21,179
What kind of parties?

796
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:22,847
I just heard about them.

797
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:25,600
Expensive, private, rich men.

798
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:28,903
<i>Maybe she found a sugar daddy.</i>

799
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,244
Doubles.

800
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:44,035
You know, Frank,

801
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:45,837
I don't know what this is,

802
00:49:45,872 --> 00:49:49,257
but, look, I don't
run things like that.

803
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:50,625
I mean, shit, who does anymore?

804
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:53,544
Mexicans?
Russians?

805
00:49:53,596 --> 00:49:56,180
That's a good
question-- who?

806
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:58,549
Who has something to gain
by trying to fuck with me?

807
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,101
You think it was someone here?

808
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:02,220
What's in it?

809
00:50:02,272 --> 00:50:04,388
What he means is

810
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,307
what you got worth
taking anymore, Frank?

811
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,192
My associate.

812
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:09,944
His name's Ben Caspere.

813
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:12,446
<i>He was into that sweet</i>
<i>Eastern Bloc pussy</i>

814
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,899
you all run between clubs.

815
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:18,986
So some of you might have
girls that know him.

816
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:21,739
Daniel here did.

817
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,824
And what I need you
to do now for me

818
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,660
is put the word out.

819
00:50:25,662 --> 00:50:27,578
Any john you rob,

820
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,498
any flea, any tick
crawls across your carpet,

821
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,717
you ask them about Ben Caspere.

822
00:50:32,752 --> 00:50:34,752
You find out
who wants what's mine.

823
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:39,173
Frankie, I think
you got us confused

824
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:40,808
with them bitches upstairs.

825
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:43,427
<i>Appreciate our past dealings,</i>

826
00:50:43,479 --> 00:50:45,563
<i>but you're the one</i>
<i>that left all that behind.</i>

827
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:48,316
<i>This ain't your club no more.</i>

828
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,234
<i>Those days done been over.</i>

829
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,403
You're straight, right?

830
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:54,772
Why don't you call a cop?

831
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:57,325
Stay where you fuckin' are.

832
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:01,946
Yeah, I know.

833
00:51:01,998 --> 00:51:04,532
You put them crazy eyes on

834
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:07,368
and everybody's supposed
to shit their pants.

835
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,705
Thing is, you ain't
that thing no more

836
00:51:10,707 --> 00:51:13,257
what you used to was.

837
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:15,009
He speak for all of you?

838
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:17,295
I'm speaking for me.

839
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:20,464
Yeah, you're tall,
but you're really little,

840
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:23,217
and you're old.

841
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:26,854
Yo, this meeting is over.

842
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:28,889
Y'all motherfuckers
get out of my place.

843
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,059
Will you talk this much

844
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:35,479
when I rip your
fuckin' lip off?

845
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,952
All right, Frankie.

846
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:42,570
You wanna squab?

847
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:48,242
You can keep your rings on.

848
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:49,744
Won't matter to me.

849
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,415
All right.

850
00:52:19,942 --> 00:52:21,993
No!

851
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:29,617
I've always hated
these fucking things.

852
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:31,786
What kind of way is that
to greet the world?

853
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:33,537
<i>Ah! Ah!</i>

854
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:47,768
We heard you quit your job as
a driver a couple weeks back.

855
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:50,855
Yes, he took care of me.
I was sick.

856
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,808
And he couldn't take
the sitting all day.

857
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,228
He's a good boy.

858
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,646
You live here with her?

859
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:00,314
Only sometimes.

860
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:02,566
I got a place with friends.

861
00:53:02,652 --> 00:53:04,785
A car was stolen
from where you work.

862
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:06,454
He wouldn't do it.

863
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:08,956
He ain't been in trouble
since he was a little boy.

864
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,992
Yo, yo, all's I did
was quit my job.

865
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:14,328
Got a lumbar problem.

866
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:34,014
Is that the fucking car?

867
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:38,018
<i>Hey!</i>

868
00:53:38,104 --> 00:53:39,570
Hey, hold on!

869
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:41,856
Don't move!
Police!

870
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:43,858
Fuck.

871
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:07,882
<i>Get outta here!</i>

872
00:54:18,227 --> 00:54:20,227
Ugh! Oh!

873
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,897
Stop, motherfucker!

874
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:26,617
Fuck!

875
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:29,120
Oh! You're gonna
burn it all!

876
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:37,244
Son of a bitch.

877
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:55,729
Ah! God damn it!

878
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:57,348
Oh, fuck!

879
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,315
My fucking ribs.

880
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:01,185
That was him.
That was fucking him.

881
00:55:01,237 --> 00:55:04,772
Fuck.

882
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:14,331
Thank you.

883
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:18,836
You wanna thank me,
tell me what state has on me.

884
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:28,546
I don't know.

885
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:54,488
I waited for you.

886
00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:04,498
What happened?

887
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:35,079
We should make up.

888
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,532
I thought...

889
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:42,586
I stayed up.

890
00:56:51,514 --> 00:56:53,714
Do you wanna talk?

891
00:57:07,313 --> 00:57:09,280
Maybe tomorrow.
