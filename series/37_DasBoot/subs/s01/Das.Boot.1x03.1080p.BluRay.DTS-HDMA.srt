1
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,481
Both planes steady at zero.
Level at 60 metres.

2
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,961
Is it getting louder?

3
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,121
Seems constant. Ahead of us.

4
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,521
2-8-0.

5
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:08,481
Two hundred and eighty...
Thirty-five...

6
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,841
Drawing further ahead, 2-9-5.

7
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,761
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder.

8
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,121
Rudder is left full, sir.

9
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,201
Steer due north.

10
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,201
- Deeper, chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

11
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,601
Pump 200 litres forward.

12
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:40,241
All ahead one-third.

13
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,481
200 metres forward, chief.

14
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:48,561
Both main motors indicate
ahead one-third.

15
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,801
Now it gets psychological, friends.

16
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,441
Check torpedo tubes!

17
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,801
Check torpedo tubes!

18
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:48,041
For God's sake!

19
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,641
Easy. Easy, guys.

20
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,561
This is nothing.

21
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,721
Kill unnecessary lights.

22
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:15,161
- Kill lights.
- Kill lights.

23
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,001
Silent speed.

24
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,481
Both main engines at 50 rpm.

25
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,881
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

26
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:47,081
Contact coming closer,
0-5-2 degrees, starboard bow, closing.

27
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,281
Closing fast.

28
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,681
Midships.

29
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,641
Both main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

30
00:04:56,401 --> 00:05:00,441
Both main engines indicate full ahead.
Right full rudder.

31
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,121
Coming straight for us, sir.

32
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,481
He knows what he's doing. Deeper.

33
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:35,801
Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

34
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,161
Destroyer coming nearer.
Almost above us now.

35
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,521
- Deeper, chief, quick.
- Stern up 10.

36
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,001
Don't be afraid.

37
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,561
It's only the pressure.

38
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,281
Deeper.

39
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,601
Stern up 15.

40
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,001
Pump out 250 litres.

41
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:16,481
Come on, hurry!

42
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,201
Tighten this flange!
Hurry up!

43
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,401
Bring her up 150 metres, chief!

44
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,801
Forward 20! Stern down 10!

45
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,401
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!

46
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,321
Come on, tighter, Frenssen! Hurry!

47
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,001
Get the damn thing tightened!

48
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,401
Depth-gauge hull valves secured.

49
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,081
Both planes are eased to zero.

50
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,121
Level at 150 metres.

51
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,881
Becoming louder.

52
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,321
She's turned around, 0-5-5.

53
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,641
Go on, get it over.

54
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,001
Contact closing fast.

55
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,441
They're above us.

56
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,641
Just above us.

57
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:29,641
Contact fading to starboard.

58
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,561
Twenty-two.

59
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,161
Twenty-three.

60
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,481
They are far away.

61
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,081
Contact receding aft.

62
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,001
Can barely hear it.

63
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,761
Now?

64
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,281
It has passed us by.

65
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,681
I think that will be all this time.

66
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,801
Silent speed.

67
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,361
Both main engines silent speed,
50 rpm.

68
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,481
Both main engines indicate 50 rpm.

69
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:13,001
- All compartments report damage.
- All compartments report damage.

70
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,601
All compartments report damage.

71
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,041
From my private collection.

72
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:08,681
- How does it look in the engine room?
- It's smashed up quite badly.

73
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:12,681
- Be able to patch her up at sea?
- Already started.

74
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,001
Be sure and make it good, chief.

75
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:19,961
I've got a feeling we're
going to see some action.

76
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,961
Nothing?

77
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,241
Waited over an hour now.

78
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,321
- I guess we've frightened them off, sir.
- Don't be so sure.

79
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:01,121
He could have stopped
and is still there waiting...

80
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:05,001
...to surprise us
when we try to surface.

81
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,161
Not dumb, the British.

82
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,841
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

83
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,521
- Aye, aye, captain.
- I guess we'll see.

84
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,201
Captain.

85
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,321
Thanks.

86
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:42,321
- What's the light like up top?
- It's dark. Sun set two hours ago.

87
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,921
Prepare to surface, 30 metres.

88
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:50,401
- Thirty metres.
- Bow planes up 15, stern planes up 5.

89
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:51,881
Ninety.

90
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,161
Eighty metres.

91
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,841
Seventy.

92
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,321
Sixty metres.

93
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,961
Fifty.

94
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,441
Coming up fast.

95
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:09,281
- Sound check at 30.
- Planes at zero. Stern down 3.

96
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,961
Level at 30 metres.

97
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,521
Well?

98
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,641
- Come to periscope depth.
- Come to periscope depth.

99
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,201
Bow up 3.

100
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:05,081
- Surface.
- Bow set to blow.

101
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,401
<i>We made it.</i>

102
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,641
<i>We have returned from hell.</i>

103
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,801
If only your mother could see you now!

104
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,921
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

105
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,201
It's the cylinder head gasket.
Probably just a loose bolt.

106
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:13,721
Can you tighten it?

107
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,521
We got a call from U-48.

108
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,241
- We'll talk about it.
- Yes. I'll be there right away.

109
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,881
- Do we have to turn in off?
- Yes, lieutenant.

110
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,161
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

111
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,401
I got bad news, guys.

112
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,161
What's up now?

113
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,481
Our soccer team is losing.

114
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,561
Five to zero.

115
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,921
Not a chance of making the finals now.

116
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,321
It can't be! I just don't believe it!

117
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,801
<i>Weather forecast,
very low pressure.</i>

118
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,121
<i>Wind speeds up to 150 to 200
kilometres per hour.</i>

119
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,001
<i>Heavy disturbance,
resulting from interaction between...</i>

120
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,721
<i>...subtropical and polar air currents.</i>

121
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,121
<i>This means a storm.</i>

122
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,641
Drop them.

123
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:13,321
You dirty little boy. Crabs.

124
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,201
A whole army of them.

125
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,601
A winkie like yours,
they'll eat it down to the bone.

126
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,761
Give them a blowout
with the gunpowder!

127
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,361
Excuse me, lieutenant.

128
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,441
Needs a shave, this meat does.

129
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:09,041
What are those things crawling about
on your eyebrows?

130
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,841
Pardon?

131
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,281
A case for the medic, I'd say.

132
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:17,481
Crabs, by the look of them.

133
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,841
- What's wrong?
- Are you joking?

134
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,521
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

135
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,641
You know, I'm certain
we'll meet a British convoy.

136
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,601
Too bad.
Berthold stopped communications.

137
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,121
Headquarters are waiting as well.

138
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:07,721
They want him to report his location.

139
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,441
Now this.

140
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,521
North Atlantic interferences.

141
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,481
Couldn't be worse.

142
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,761
Well...

143
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:30,681
At least
we're showing you a good time.

144
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:35,601
Okay, guys, get that stuff
into the torpedo room.

145
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,721
Hey, you two, give me a hand.

146
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,961
Move it. Don't fall asleep.

147
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:45,321
- Boatswain.
- Yes, lieutenant?

148
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:49,841
- Do you know where the medic is?
- In the bow compartment, lieutenant.

149
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,921
- Come on in. The more the merrier.
- The crabs got you too!

150
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,081
Hey, lieutenant,
got your swimsuit on?

151
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,121
Oh, darling, that's divine.

152
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,361
Are you looking for your camera,
lieutenant?

153
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,801
Hoist the sails,
the wind is blowing.

154
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:27,641
At least we don't have to deal
with airplanes in this shitty weather.

155
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,081
It's a hard life at sea, huh?

156
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,081
Not if you took it lying down.

157
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,321
What's the matter, lieutenant,
still can't find your camera?

158
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:16,281
Lieutenant!

159
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:19,281
Lieutenant, watch yourself, sir.

160
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:24,521
- What?
- Take it easy! Calm down!

161
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,561
Have you gone crazy or something?

162
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,361
Guess what.
Have you heard the latest?

163
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,801
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

164
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:42,601
- Lord help the stupid pig!
- You're such a mean bastard!

165
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,641
I thought he only jerks off!

166
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:48,761
They should stick you in a zoo
and mate you with a chimpanzee.

167
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,001
Here are pictures of
the beautiful Fräulein!

168
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,801
- Let me see.
- Where did you find them, asshole?

169
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,201
Asshole!

170
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:02,401
Are you really fucking this broad?

171
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,601
- I've got a great idea.
- What?

172
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,681
How'd you like to take
a swim in this weather?

173
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:44,641
Can you swim at all?

174
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:26,401
These boats are built to take it.

175
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,721
A real storm on a sailing ship.
You should try that sometime.

176
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,081
You hardly feel a thing down here.

177
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:47,361
- Captain?
- Compass.

178
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,841
The boat's heaving starboard.
I can't keep her on course.

179
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,721
No cause for concern.

180
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,641
But it is pointless, sir.

181
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,641
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

182
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,041
Prepare to dive.

183
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:28,121
- Diving stations!
- Diving stations.

184
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,481
Stand by, all main vents.

185
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,721
<i>What a blessing. How merciful.</i>

186
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:18,681
<i>What a bliss.</i>

187
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:23,281
<i>The captain is taking
us down for an hour.</i>

188
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:26,201
<i>One hour...</i>

189
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,281
<i>...of peace and quiet.</i>

190
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,601
Not the greatest success, is it?

191
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,441
Position reports, very faint.

192
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,761
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

193
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,241
Well, well...

194
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:28,161
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders...

195
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,641
...there's nothing to do but pray.

196
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:42,161
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.

197
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,721
No ship's as safe as our U-boats.

198
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,321
Hinrich.

199
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,041
Put the record on again.

200
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,201
You know the one.

201
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:15,201
<i>Our 40th day at sea.</i>

202
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,921
<i>The storm has been raging now
for one whole week.</i>

203
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,961
Watch out! Heads down!

204
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,321
Look out!

205
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,401
Man overboard!

206
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:54,081
Pilgrim!

207
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:44,241
Watch out! Watch out!

208
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,761
Watch out!

209
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:52,081
Hold on! Hold on!

210
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,561
I got him! Make way!

211
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,241
Hold on!

212
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,881
The first-aid kit.
Bring the first-aid kit!

213
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,401
Damn it!

214
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,401
Bring the first-aid kit! Damn it!

215
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,401
- Prepare to dive.
- The first-aid kit!

216
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:32,441
<i>"Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership.</i>

217
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,641
<i>No form of training is possible
without his example."</i>

218
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:38,881
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

219
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,961
He was lucky.

220
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:46,961
What a rotten month.

221
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,161
Absolutely rotten.

222
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:54,801
Mildew is good for you.

223
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,801
A royal organism...

224
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:04,081
...just like hyacinths.

225
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:10,601
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

226
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:21,601
Must be snowing already back home.

227
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,681
<i>"If you wish to learn the art of
leadership...</i>

228
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,961
<i>...become a whole person."</i>

229
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,561
Strange.

230
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,521
It's been years since I've seen snow.

231
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:42,201
- Can I have a look?
- Sure.

232
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,681
Your wife?

233
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,841
<i>The 15th day of the storm.</i>

234
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:04,481
Look! There, in front! There!

235
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:13,081
Bridge to captain, U-boat at port bow!

236
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:17,241
A German boat! A German U-boat!

237
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:24,161
Heading 3-5-0.
Over there.

238
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,961
Almost straight ahead!

239
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:33,321
You're right!

240
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:39,641
- Both engines stop. Bring up the light.
- Both engines stop! Bring up the light!

241
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,201
Look, it's Thomsen! Thomsen!

242
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:18,601
Both engines stop. Bring up the lights.
It's Thomsen!

243
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,641
Good hunting, you old rascal!

244
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,161
My God, Phillip.

245
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,201
So they've pushed you
out to sea again.

246
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,801
Goddamn it!

247
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:06,601
A dozen boats we've got in the Atlantic!

248
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:10,041
From Greenland to the Azores,
a mere dozen!

249
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:14,521
But still we almost collide
with one of our own!

250
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:18,801
Sixty metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

251
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:25,281
Something's wrong here.

252
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,041
Have you checked on our position?

253
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:35,721
- More or less, captain.
- More or less? That's not good enough!

254
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:39,121
We haven't had a sun shot in 14 days.

255
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,841
And we've been drifting in this storm.

256
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,121
Hard to compute.

257
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:55,121
I understand.

258
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:00,521
We make a few errors in our own
position, the others do the same...

259
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:04,961
...and we end up playing collision
games, leaving the route wide open.

260
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,961
And so we allow the British
to shove the whole armada through.

261
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,041
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,961
It's another story when you're
in the middle of the ocean, lieutenant.

263
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,241
I hope you're making notes of all this.

264
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,881
Maybe Headquarters will listen to you.

265
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,481
You've more influence than I have, sir.

266
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:34,681
So you believe that?

267
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,521
Come up 100 metres aft.
Stern planes up 10.

268
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:59,641
Hey, man, ram it with a cork,
will you? Dirty pig.

269
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:04,961
It's gas, you know.
These Brussels sprouts.

270
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,041
Horst!

271
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,841
<i>Spirits are abysmally low.</i>

272
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:57,801
<i>This ordeal is putting
human endurance to the test.</i>

273
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:03,481
<i>It's an experiment to sound out
the limits of our ability to suffer.</i>

274
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:16,881
<i>It's happened at last.
After three weeks and two days...</i>

275
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,361
<i>...the storm has subsided.</i>

276
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:32,761
<i>From now on, the intensity and extent
of military operations in the East...</i>

277
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:38,681
<i>... will be governed by the onset of
the Russian winter. Despite attacks...</i>

278
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,761
A signal, captain.

279
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:45,641
<i>... German and Italian troops have had
local successes. Enemy forces met...</i>

280
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:51,761
<i>... with heavy losses. While bombarding
strategic targets in Leningrad...</i>

281
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:57,401
<i>...our artillery hit an ammunition dump,
causing severe explosions and fires.</i>

282
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:01,601
Nothing from Thomsen?

283
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:08,281
I've been trying to make contact
with him for days.

284
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,441
He should have reported in by now.

285
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:21,121
You will soon be announcing
another submarine missing.

286
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:31,521
<i>Last night, the enemy penetrated
German airspace at several points.</i>

287
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:36,601
<i>Nine British bombers were shot down.
Waves of enemy aircraft dropped...</i>

288
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,841
<i>...fire and high- explosive bombs...</i>

289
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,801
<i>...mainly on non military targets
in northwestern and western Germany.</i>

290
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:46,961
<i>A large number of civilians
in Hamburg and Cologne...</i>

291
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:50,441
<i>... were injured or killed.
That concludes today's broadcast...</i>

292
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:53,041
<i>...from the Armed Forces
High Command.</i>

293
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:08,361
His wife lives in Cologne.

294
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:11,321
I know.

295
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:27,401
Didn't you say you had relatives
living in Cologne, Number One?

296
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:34,401
Lost my fiancée two months back
in an air raid on Cologne.

297
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:46,241
I'm sorry.

298
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:10,881
<i>Our lack of success
is depressing the captain.</i>

299
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,201
<i>He seems to feel that the failures...</i>

300
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:17,281
<i>...of the entire submarine unit
are his personal responsibility.</i>

301
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,961
Cut your flashlight, already.

302
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,801
Ready? Emergency lighting only.
It's bound to be a false alarm.

303
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:37,081
What's up?

304
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,961
A convoy.

305
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:55,481
- Permission to come up?
- Affirmative.

306
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:46,921
Outward-bound convoy, five columns.

307
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,841
Very juicy.

308
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,681
Any escorts in sight?

309
00:45:56,281 --> 00:46:00,241
- Destroyers?
- No, no screen.

310
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,641
They have no protection. Nothing.

311
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:09,401
That's funny.

312
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,481
They could be off chasing one of ours.

313
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,361
Yeah.

314
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,601
That damn moon.

315
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:32,561
- How many of our boats are in contact?
- Five.

316
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,641
Do we risk it?

317
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:44,041
It's worth a try, captain.

318
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:48,841
Come left to 1-8-0.

319
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,521
Left 5 degrees, rudder.
New course, 1-8-0.

320
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:57,121
<i>Steady on course 1-8-0, sir.</i>

321
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:01,521
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

322
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:07,481
It will work, captain. We've got them.

323
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:24,121
- Prepare tubes 1 through 4 for firing.
- Flood tubes one through four.

324
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:27,601
I'm going in. Master sight to Bridge.

325
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:29,841
<i>Master sight to Bridge.</i>

326
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:35,041
<i>Tubes one through four flooded.</i>

327
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:51,281
All full ahead, left full rudder.
Come to 1-0-7.

328
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:52,521
Stand by to attack.

329
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:59,361
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil!

330
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:04,561
Bow angle bearing 0-5-0.

331
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:06,281
Locked on.

332
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:09,201
- Range, 2200 metres.
- Check.

333
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,401
Those two that are overlapping...

334
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,721
...double shot on the big one.
The other two, a single each.

335
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,321
- Targets identified.
- Right standard rudder.

336
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:22,601
All ahead one-third. Open bow caps.

337
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,601
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle 0-6-3.

338
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:31,721
- Check, locked on!
- Hold on for bearing.

339
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:37,241
- All set!
- Tubes one and two, fire when matched.

340
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:40,401
- Tubes one and two ready!
- Tubes one and two ready!

341
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:42,881
- Tube one, fire!
- Tube one, fire!

342
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:47,921
- Tube two, fire!
- Tube two, fire!

343
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,841
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready!

344
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:56,401
- Tube three ready!
- Tube three, fire!

345
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,001
Tube three fired!

346
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,801
- Tube four ready.
- Tube four ready!

347
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:05,641
- Tube four, fire!
- Tube four, fire!

348
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,921
Destroyer ahead!

349
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:13,761
Alarm!

350
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:17,801
All hands forward!
Forward diving position!

351
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:24,441
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Keep it moving!

352
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:27,561
- Clear the way!
