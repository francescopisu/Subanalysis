1
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:58,590
You see, I mean, to me Janice, art, you know - art as...an
art, must by its very nature be self-indulgent, right.

2
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:04,939
I mean as I said to, David Hockney once, 'The inherent
element in all artistic projects

3
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:07,749
should not be one of contemporary
mass appeal

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,188
but rather one of personal symbolism.'
Don't you agree Janice?

5
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,373
I dunno Rodney.

6
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:22,956
Oh well, um, you know that's why I like talking to you,
you're one of the few people who seems to understand me.

7
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:26,327
My brother Don paints you
know.

8
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,449
- Really?
- Yeah, for the council.

9
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,228
No, that is cosmic Janice.
No really - no that is cosmic that.

10
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:38,591
That's probably why we have the same appreciation
and understanding of true art.

11
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:47,120
I mean, we have an affinity, an aesthetic bond, we are kindred
spirits, Janice, seekers of beauty in a broken ugly world.

12
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,506
- Janice?
- Yes Rodney.

13
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:56,103
- Get yer bra off.
- I can't.

14
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:59,496
Well of course you can, you
must live and be free!

15
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:09,003
- I can't Rodney, I'm not wearing one!
- Oh, well.

16
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,964
It ain't half dark in here innit.

17
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:26,815
Oh put him down Janice, put him down, you don't know
where he's been...Oh well, what we got going on here.

18
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:30,858
Oh I'll have to drop off that - thanks. Here, look,
we don't want all this rubbish on do we, eh?

19
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,406
That's better. Oi Janice, mind
his bruises won't you.

20
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:36,642
What bruises?

21
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:44,150
He's covered in 'em, it's where the girls keep on pushing him
away with 10ft barge poles. Oh dear, oh dear, that's better.

22
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,192
You're in are you Del?

23
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:55,073
Yes, yes, I'm in Rodders. Hope you've been behaving yourself,
remember what I told you, not to do it on your own doorstep?

24
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,185
We've just been sitting here
discussing art that's all.

25
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,778
D'you like art Del?

26
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,365
Oh yeah, Del used to be a
cultural adviser to the Chelsea Shed!

27
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:10,924
Yes, I like art Janice. I like art, I'm a Renaissance man myself.
I like them picture where the eyes follow you round the room.

28
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:17,782
Last week, down the pie and eel shop, Del shook
the international  art world to it's very foundations by stating,

29
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:21,261
quite openly, that
Michaelangelo was a wally-brain.

30
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,459
Well he was a wally-brain weren't he? It took him 12
years to paint one ceiling.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,691
That wouldn't do your brother
Donald any good would it Janice, eh?

32
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:31,840
Well he's on bonus.

33
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,132
I do not believe this, I'm
gonna wake up in a minute!

34
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,619
Here, look, I'll tell you another thing while we're on
about it an' all.

35
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:41,452
You know some of these artists you know,
they're a bit sick if you ask me.

36
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,022
What are you on about now?

37
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:49,414
Well look, take a look at this right. Now this is a statuette
of the world-famous Venus de Milo, right?

38
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:57,238
Now who but the sick of mind would do a
sculpture of a disabled person? Am I right Janice?

39
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,142
- It's a bit sick innit!
- There you are.

40
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,327
It weren't like that originally!

41
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:05,635
No, no, no, this is the product of a
twisted imagination this Rodney.

42
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,281
Yeah here, talking of twisted imaginations are you
still looking for a job?

43
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,958
What in this country?

44
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,357
There's three million
unemployed, what chance has Rodney got?

45
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,901
Well, with his big brother looking after him he's got
every chance in the world.

46
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:20,315
Now take one of your purple hearts
Rodney because I've got a surprise for you.

47
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:25,391
I have managed to secure you for a
position with a newly formed security company!

48
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:30,353
Now they did want a man with previous
experience and, as your last job was a milk monitor,

49
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:36,199
I did have a bit of trouble persuading them but,
however, I have managed to swing it for you.

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,941
Are you putting me up Del?

51
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,081
No, definitely, I've got a job
for you Rodney!

52
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,351
Hey that's great Del!

53
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,708
Yeah, it's alright, you'll
start off as a trainee NSO.

54
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,778
No.

55
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:50,494
Oh yes and who knows my son you know - you know,
use your old filbert, keep your nose clean,

56
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:54,727
a couple of years' time you could you could end up as a,
well - I don't know - a senior NSO.

57
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:59,185
- Oh I will Del, I won't let you down son.
- What's an NSO.?

58
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:04,565
Oh don't be gauche Janice.
What's an NSO.?

59
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,805
They don't know they're born
some of them do they?

60
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:11,198
That's right! Tell her what an
NSO is Del.

61
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,548
An NSO Janice is a Nocturnal
Security Officer.

62
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:20,939
Yeah see it's a nocturnal security officer. That don't
'arf sound like a night watchman Del!

63
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:26,880
It's nothing like a nightwatch- man! I mean yeah, yeah, you
will have to work at night.

64
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,768
And will some of my duties
include 'watching'?

65
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,476
No they won't, no I mean all you'll have to do is,
you'll just have to - you know,

66
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,043
you just have to well...
keep an eye out.

67
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:43,272
What is the name of this
recently formed security company then?

68
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,247
Oh well, you wouldn't have
heard of 'em.

69
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,840
Try me Del. Come on, let's
have it.

70
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:52,603
It's called...Trotter Watch!

71
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,534
Trotter Watch, that's you
innit? I'm working for you, ain't I?

72
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:02,964
Yeah, you see the way I see it Rodney is that crime is a
growth industry so I'm getting in while the going's good.

73
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:07,264
It's a nice regular job - got
a uniform - good wages.

74
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:08,405
How good?

75
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:12,847
We'll talk about that later.
First of all let us try on your uniform eh?

76
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:18,152
Yeah come on, slip into. There it is.
Oh look at that, colour suits you don't it, eh?

77
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:26,464
Yes look at that fit, oh yeah,
deja vu, it's like made to measure innit?

78
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,626
Yeah for someone else!

79
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,050
Oh well the sleeves and that - well he'll grow into them.
Don't worry about that, hey, let's have a look - that's it.

80
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,277
- TW.
- That's right, stands for Trotter Watch.

81
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:40,732
Could also stand for Traffic
Warden though.

82
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,336
Well - yes it could,
Traffic warden yeah.

83
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,422
This is a traffic warden's
uniform innit?

84
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,096
It is not a traffic warden's
uniform!

85
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,144
You've got me done up as a
bloody traffic warden!

86
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:57,533
Look it is once and for all not a traffic warden's uniform!
Now just trust me will you...Put your cap on.

87
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:05,749
I look like a traffic warden. I look like a traffic warden
who hasn't been well!

88
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:13,872
No you don't, you look stunning Rodders. Oh yeah, look at that,
you're emitting authority all over the place.

89
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,106
I'm not doing it Del. I don't
want the job.

90
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:19,671
Oh no, come on Rodney, you've got to do it,
you can't let me down, I gave then your word.

91
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:20,797
Gave who my word?

92
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,598
The people down at the Tyler Street bus and coach garage.
That's where you're gonna be based.

93
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,567
No I'm definitely not doing it
Del.

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:35,435
Oh alright, yeah okay. Well of course if you're scared!
You could admit it, come on. Allemagne dix points,

95
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,885
Janice'll understand if yer
bottle has gone.

96
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,032
Me scared? You must be joking!

97
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:50,660
Ah, that's the spirit, now I want you down there tomorrow
night nine o' clock. I'm a stickler for punctuality right.

98
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,266
Right then, I'm going to bed.

99
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,194
By the way, excuse me a minute Janice,

100
00:07:57,461 --> 00:08:00,010
Your bondage robes
there're in the garage - alright?

101
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:05,570
And Grandad has washed your whip and he's put
it in the airing cupboard. I don't think it's shrunk.

102
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:12,245
Well I'll leave you two love birds alone.
And shall I just say 'Buenos Aires'. its.

103
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:18,021
Janice he was only...

104
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:22,166
You rotten git Del!

105
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:30,946
Well I'll leave it in your
capable hands then Rodders.

106
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:35,078
Yeah cheers Del...you realise this job's gonna
mess up my love-life don't you!

107
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,379
Yeah, that's why I'm giving you
every second Sunday off, ain't I?

108
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,888
Yeah but Janice is hardly gonna
be happy with that is she?

109
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,307
I mean while I'm down here at nights she could be
going out with someone else.

110
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,764
Now don't worry about that.What d'you think I'm all
dressed up for like this,eh?

111
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,274
I'm taking Janice out for
a meal.

112
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,921
You're taking Janice out?

113
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,332
Of course I am, for your sake, otherwise
she might be going out with somebody else!

114
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:08,335
- Yeah, cheers Del. But if she's...
- Why are you wearing plimsoles?

115
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,336
What?

116
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:17,695
I said, why are you wearing plimsoles, don't you think they
mar the overall symmetry of the uniform somewhat?

117
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,721
- I can run faster in these...
- You what?

118
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,996
I mean give chase you know...
pursue and detain sort of!

119
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:29,331
No, nothing happens round here.
It's as quiet as a grave.

120
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:34,639
Well I'll see you in the morning then Rodders,
take care now!

121
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:40,732
Yeah, don't worry about me Del, I'll be alright.

122
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:41,624
Ah, here you are Grandad, there you go. Look at that.
Look at that, eh? It's beautiful innit? Beautiful.

123
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:44,380
It's gonna earn our fortunes this is Grandad!

124
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,677
Come on Rodney it's ten to nine.

125
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:51,217
I used to be a security officer
you know, before the war.

126
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:54,731
Blimey, do you mean to say that somebody
actually trusted you with their property?

127
00:10:55,008 --> 00:11:02,228
It's like trusting a piranha fish
with yer finger - or worse.

128
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:11,552
Oh yeah, it was a big warehouse over Kilburn way,
stocked everything from bedroom suites to kiddies' toys.

129
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:18,375
Well, there was this fella used to work there,
he used to arrive every morning in a big Wolseley car,

130
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:26,956
he wore a camel-hair overcoat, kid gloves and he always
carried a brand-new leather attache case

131
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:36,488
and he smoked expensive cigars. Well, call it
intuition if you like, but I was suspicious of him.

132
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:40,927
- Yeah, why?
- Well he was only a sweeper-up!

133
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:46,066
Cor, how do you do it Holmes?

134
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:56,094
Anyhow, one night he was leaving I stopped him and
I searched his attache case. It was empty.

135
00:11:57,026 --> 00:12:02,118
Still, unperturbed by this minor
hiccup in my investigation.

136
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:08,988
I stopped him and searched his attache case
every night for a whole year. Then he left.

137
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,127
I wonder why?

138
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:21,426
I don't remember. I think he claimed someone
was victimizing him. No unions in them days see.

139
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,740
No, well that is it - innit, eh?

140
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:30,911
Anyway, a couple of weeks after he left the auditors come.
D' you know what they discovered?

141
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:36,470
We was missing 348 attache
cases!

142
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:41,691
What do you mean you had been
searching stolen gear?

143
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:53,380
Yeah and I got done for it. Finger-prints.  There's a moral
to that story Del Boy but for the life of me I can't find it.

144
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,638
I don't think I'm even gonna
bother to look either Grandad.

145
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,315
Hello the son of the bride of
Dracula. Here he is.

146
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,388
- What time is it?
- The time is nearly nine o' clock.

147
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:06,858
Nine? I'm gonna be late if I
don't get a move on.

148
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:10,685
No, no, it's alright. There's no hurry, go on, sit down.
Take it easy, that's it, go on.

149
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,309
Let me get you a cup of
tea, alright?

150
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:14,042
- Oh yeah.
- Here you go then.

151
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,629
Are you still taking my part
with Janice?

152
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes, don't worry, I won't let
you down.

153
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,192
Oh cheers Del...How am I doing?

154
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:25,779
Very well, very well. Yes one
more steak meal could crack it.

155
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,141
Yeah? I haven't done this well
with a girl for a long time.

156
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:34,520
You're like me Rodney, I never
ever found it easy to get girlfriends.

157
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,083
I wonder why.

158
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:40,288
Here it's still light out. It's
broad daylight!

159
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,930
Yeah, of course it would be wouldn't it, nine o' clock in
the morning, what do you expect?

160
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:47,758
Nine o' clock in the morning? I thought it would be
nine at night. I've only been in bed 20 minutes!

161
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,570
What d'you wake me for?

162
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,901
Sit down. Sit down. It's alright, alright,
don't exaggerate, 20 minutes.

163
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,742
Listen, I want to discuss something
very important with you see.

164
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,215
What could be that important,
eh? I haven't got Janice into trouble, have we?

165
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:07,896
Don't be silly, least I hope not. I want to talk to you see.
No, listen now,

166
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:13,097
this night security job of yours is
merely a tiny part of my immaculate scheme.

167
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,493
What immaculate scheme?

168
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:20,202
The Tourist Trade Rodney. The Tourist Trade. Did you realise
that over 2,000 are pouring into London every day?

169
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:26,048
And I happen to know, despite the fact that tourism
has never been so high, the coach party trade is falling off.

170
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:31,480
Now, why you may ask, is that Del? Well, since you ask,
I will tell you Rodney.

171
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,185
The reason is yer average tourist gets fed up,
don't he, of seeing the old places.

172
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,230
Like the Houses of Parliament, Buck House, the National Gallery.
Once you've seen one Rubens, you've seen them all.

173
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,974
Now this is where a dynamic person like
me steps in.

174
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:49,365
Wake up while your brother's
being dynamic!

175
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:50,783
So, go on.

176
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:57,721
Yeah, right, you see out there Rodney, out there is a new
vibrant exciting London waiting to be discovered.

177
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:01,723
- Is there?
- Yeah of course there is. Ethnic London.

178
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,755
Ethnic London?

179
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:08,448
Yeah, yes, you know all those romantic
places that you've heard about in fairy tales.

180
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:16,092
You know the Lee Valley Viaduct, the glow of
Lower Edmonton at dusk,

181
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:21,859
the excitement of a walk about in Croydon, yeah,
look what I've had printed.

182
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:29,994
Oh I don't believe this. Trotter's Ethnic Tours.
What's all this squiggly stuff and the Chinese?

183
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:33,300
The squiggly stuff - the squiggly - that is Arabic
and the Chinese is Japanese.

184
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:40,145
It's a well-known fact that 90 per cent of all foreign tourists
come from abroad, so we've got to speak the lingo, ain't we?

185
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:40,830
We?

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,937
French I like it. Already you're picking up the lingo.
It's what I call enthusiasm Rodney.

187
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,723
I weren't speaking French Del,
I meant what do you mean 'we'?

188
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,474
We, us - you know, us - here you know -
'cos it's a family enterprise innit.

189
00:15:55,724 --> 00:16:01,904
Grandad, he'll sell the programmes, I shall be the courier
and you, Rodney, you have got the best job of all

190
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:10,859
'cos you will drive the bus, hold tight everybody
Rodney's coming, eh? It'll be another wage Rodney.

191
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,464
I've already got a wage Del.

192
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,886
Yeah but you can't afford to
live on what I pay you, can you!

193
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:16,688
I don't know Del, how much you
paying me?

194
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:24,797
Well not a lot, not a lot. You see I can't afford to.
See, well I, I done a deal with the bus garage,

195
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:30,411
what happened was I provided them with a
nightwatchm...a nocturnal security operative, see,

196
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,394
and they provided me with an open- topped bus.
That saves the exchange of any cash.

197
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,704
- You know, stops any paperwork and...
- And income tax?

198
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:45,258
Income tax yeah. Well, come on, what about it Rodney,
a lot of work and effort's gone into this enterprise.

199
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,770
I mean, Grandad, he was up town this morning
at the crack of dawn

200
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,328
distributing all those leaflets to every hotel,
boarding house and hostel he could find.

201
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,554
Grandad, he believes in this
scheme, don't you Grandad?

202
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,335
Ethnic tours, it's the most stupidest thing
I've ever heard of.

203
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:03,614
See.

204
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:10,748
Del you can't expect me to work all night then, in the
morning, drive a bus load of tourists round ethnic London?

205
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:14,736
I've got to sleep Del.
My whole body is crying out for sleep.

206
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:22,009
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll get you some
assistance at the garage then you can have a kip,

207
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:27,005
- I'll get you an ex-police dog.
- An ex-police dog?

208
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:30,989
- Yeah, now do you fancy some breakfast?
- I wouldn't say no.

209
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:34,541
Good, great, come on then, off you go,
there you go -  in there.

210
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,100
While you're in there make me
a bacon sandwich, alright?

211
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:41,459
Where are you gonna get an ex-
police dog from?

212
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,691
- I'll get him - I'll get him Nero.
- Who's Nero?

213
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:49,640
Nero, Janice's corgi!

214
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:19,012
We clearly stated on our leaflets nine o' clock was
departure time. Here we are eleven-thirty , no sign of 'em!

215
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,243
I've told you before no one
will turn up.

216
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,498
Yes they will, soon as the word spreads about a bit,
they'll be here in droves.

217
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,977
No the only thing that worries me is, is a 59-seater bus
gonna be big enough?

218
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,445
Perhaps we should have
had two, you know maybe three.

219
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:38,109
- A tandem would be too big.
- Leave it out will you.

220
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:42,196
I'll bet not one single tourist
arrives.

221
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:47,836
- I'll bet you, 50 quid they do.
- Right, 50 quid, you're on.

222
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,366
- Right then.
- Alright.

223
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,672
- Right.
- Right.

224
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:58,320
Shut up you two will yer. I didn't get a wink of sleep
last night taking that rotten dog for walkies...

225
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:04,224
and what 'ave yer. That's a funny kind of police dog
that Del, it saw a cat and run a mile.

226
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:10,916
Ah well, cats aren't Nero's strong point. But show him a
burglar and it becomes a tower of strength.

227
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,781
Where's all the tourists then? I thought we'd be having
an ethnic look round Chingford by now.

228
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:21,144
Don't worry, they'll be here.

229
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,612
Shut up you...

230
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,995
How much you charging them for
his tour then?

231
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,995
- 17 quid each.
- 17 pounds for a walk-about in Croydon?

232
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,825
Well that includes lunch don't it.
Traditional British flare...

233
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,675
...doner kebab, something like that.

234
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,644
A doner kebab. For 17 nicker
I'd want Donna Summer.

235
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:46,933
You would wouldn't you, you tight wad.
No, these tourists, they don't mind splashing out,

236
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:49,150
providing they're getting value for money.

237
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:54,057
Now look at that, they'll snap these souvenirs
of Olde London up they will.

238
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,252
That's a snip that is at a fiver a go,
almost alabaster, you know.

239
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:04,557
You're going to sell 'em models of a Greek statue
now housed in the Louvre gallery Paris

240
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:08,592
for souvenirs of Olde London? It's
the Venus de Milo, Del.

241
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,881
No, that is Boadicea that is
innit?

242
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:17,244
Boadicea rode round in a chariot with big swords
sticking out the wheels.

243
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,384
Alright, so she fell off her
chariot.

244
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,427
You're just trying to rip 'em
off, aren't you?

245
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,138
Au contraire Rodney, au contraire.
No, I don't want to leave them potless.

246
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:32,526
I want them to have some money in their
pockets, at least enough for us to have a tip.

247
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:38,703
As a courier what do you actually know about these
places you intend to drag 'em to?

248
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,040
Know? Nothing, which means twice as much as they know.
Don't worry, I shall bluff 'em Rodney.

249
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:50,425
I shall use the old spiel. If there're questions
that I find a bit dodgy to answer,

250
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:55,815
I shall just say I can't understand their English.
Don't worry, it'll be a doddle.

251
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:05,348
I mean, today I shall take 'em down Shoreditch
and show 'em the house where Sherlock Holmes was born.

252
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,055
Sherlock Holmes was fictional.

253
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:11,955
Was he? Oh well, I'll just say his house
was blown up during the war.

254
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:16,114
Tomorrow I shall take
them to the summit of Mount Pleasant.

255
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,045
The summit of Mount Pleasant!

256
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,813
What's the matter with you Grandad,
can't you stand heights or something.

257
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:28,122
Mount Pleasant hasn't got a summit.
All it's got is a big post office sorting depot.

258
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:33,479
Well that's ethnic innit, eh? We can give 'em
a guided tour of the depot,

259
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:39,470
you know show 'em the workers getting the most
from our post. I should stay awake if I was you.

260
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,924
They'll be here in their
hundreds in a minute.

261
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,342
I'll take 'em over to North London, you know, show 'em
where Jack the Ripper was buried.

262
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,257
Nobody knows where Jack the Ripper was buried.

263
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,419
Then they cannot prove me wrong, can they?

264
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,703
Shall we give 'em another five minutes then go Del

265
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,356
Yeah, alright. Take the bus back to the garage
then you can begin your night shift, alright?

266
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,553
I want you back first thing in the morning though.

267
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:15,640
And don't forget to take Nero out so that he can do his
business, alright?

268
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:35,530
A pint of lager Rodney, they'd sold right out of Pina Coladas
Del, so I got you a Mackeson instead.

269
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:40,128
Oh that's good thinking yes,
thank you Grandad.

270
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:46,247
What are you going to do if the tourists start asking
about the history of the places.

271
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,658
I mean, say one of them wants to know how the
Elephant and Castle got it's name.

272
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:58,901
Well I'll just say...er, once upon a time Richard the
Lionheart or Coeur de Lion as the French used to call him -

273
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:04,077
which he did not like one little bit - see where a
little bit of intimate knowledge goes a long way

274
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,755
in impressing people. Well, I'll say that he had a castle
situated roughly near the roundabout.

275
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,635
And what about the 'elephant'
bit?

276
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:21,495
I'll say er, Hannibal and his elephants lay siege to the
castle and Bob's yer uncle.

277
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,374
But Hannibal crossed the Alps.

278
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:31,891
I know, on his way to the castles, and the natives who
had never seen an elephant, they were sorely afraid.

279
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:37,489
And that is how it became known in
that area as the Elephant and Castle.

280
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:43,771
If they'd never seen an elephant before how did they
know it was an elephant?

281
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:51,068
For Gawd sake Grandad, a elephant's a bloody elephant,
innit? I mean you can't odds that!

282
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:56,217
I mean, you can't look at an elephant and say, I know we'll
call this place the Cow and Castle, you can't do that can you?

283
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:59,254
But you're not telling them
the truth are you?

284
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:08,029
The truth? The truth, you're so naive, Rodders. The truth
is only relative to what you can earn from a lie! Einstein.

285
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:14,708
I'll tell you one truth that you won't earn a brass
farthing out of. No one's gonna turn up.

286
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:19,677
They will turn up. They've got to...
This time next year we'll be millionaires.

287
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:25,460
You said that this time last
year!

288
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,977
You're eating, ain't yer?

289
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:37,100
No. I wanted to do this for years
Rodney. I always thought if we could make a success of it,

290
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:43,192
that eventually we would go legit. You know, we would
register the name Trotters Independent Traders

291
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:52,770
as a proper McCoy company. I have this dream
where you and I own this skyscraper office block

292
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:59,174
on the South Bank. And we're standing on the balcony
in a penthouse suite with a couple of sorts,

293
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,881
Gabrielle, Bianca,
bra-less but with class

294
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:10,730
- here did you know your Janice doesn't wear a bra.
- Yeah, I know.

295
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:16,192
Oh you know. Anyway we're in our penthouse full of rubber
plants and pine tongue and groove -

296
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:25,183
and we're sipping red drinks. And above us on top
of this skyscraper in 50ft neon high lettering

297
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:31,433
are the initials of Trotters Independent
Traders! Good innit, eh?

298
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:33,655
Triffic Del.

299
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:40,867
They've got to come. My dream starts the way
every success starts, with a big rip-off.

300
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,682
Del. Grandad's right, no-ones
gonna turn up.

301
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,573
Yes they will, you wait and
see.

302
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:51,275
I think that dream of yours
contains a subliminal message.

303
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:53,682
Yeah, you what?

304
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:59,493
A sort of subconscious truth. You see this skyscraper
belonging to Trotters Independent Traders right!

305
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,216
And on the roof is the company's initials and you're
standing on the penthouse balcony?

306
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:11,457
Well don't you see what the dream's trying to tell you? As
you're standing on that balcony with your red drink -

307
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:18,704
just above your head, in 50ft- high neon lettering,
is the word 'TIT'.

308
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:29,749
Come on, let's call it a day.

309
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,102
You owe me 50 quid on that bet!

310
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:43,889
Alright you old pessimist!

311
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:08,025
- What about our wages then Del?
- Oh yeah, I meant to talk to you about that!

312
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:35,106
I thought that was going to be the big one Rodney. I thought
I was gonna become the Freddie Laker of the highways.

313
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:36,952
It was a nice try Del.

314
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,457
Yeah, I don't understand it though,
I just don't understand it.

315
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:45,610
Grandad distributed a thousand leaflets, a thousand.
You'd have thought that one, just one punter

316
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:51,195
might have been interested.
Still, as dear old Mum used to say

317
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,340
'Its better to know you've lost
than not to know you've won'.

318
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:00,825
Dear old Mum, she used to say some
bloody stupid things...

319
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,010
I'm gonna chuck this down the
chute.

320
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:15,540
Well that weren't too bad was it Rodney?
I've had two days away from the housework,

321
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:26,884
a nice little drink and I've won meself a 50 quid bet.
Very nice, very nice indeed... Where's Del Boy?

322
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,683
Oh he's just gone to chuck
that sign down the dust chute.

323
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:35,134
The dust chute? Oh my Gawd!

324
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:43,450
Grandad! Come here, you senile
old parasite.

325
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,108
It wasn't me Del, it was me
brain!

326
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:54,031
It was your - I'll brain you if I catch up with you.
Come here. Get him! Oi!

327
00:28:56,578 --> 00:29:00,361
