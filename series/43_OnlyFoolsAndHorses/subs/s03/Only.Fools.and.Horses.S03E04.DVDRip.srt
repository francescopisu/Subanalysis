1
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:43,960
Right, come on, come on. Let's
have it on. Get it on. Get in here.

2
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:46,722
That's it. Right, come on,
careful - careful with it.

3
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,000
Come on, we ain't got all day.
Alright.

4
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:49,997
It's heavy.

5
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:57,553
Come on then. Mind your hernia Grandad.
Put your end down there Grandad, that's right.

6
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:58,715
Now your end Rodney.

7
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,100
Gordon Bennett Rodney, what is
your game?

8
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,895
This could be a de-luxe Chippendale
and you're treating it

9
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,548
like something we've dragged out for the bonfire.

10
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,211
That's about the best place
for it.

11
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,607
You don't know, this could be
a Queen Anne cabinet.

12
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,589
Oh, give over Del.

13
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:16,384
Don't look very old to me.

14
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:20,578
Ah - no - that is because when
you was a lad this was probably 'G' plan.

15
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:27,069
But to anyone born after
the Napoleonic Wars this is antique.

16
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:29,235
Anyway I'm going to put
an ad in the paper in the morning.

17
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,849
Don't know what to charge for it though.
What d'you reckon, what, 95?

18
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:35,574
Why don't you go the whole hog
and make it a pound?

19
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:39,563
You're starting to annoy me.

20
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,178
Hey, it's got woodworm.

21
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:44,583
That has not got woodworm.

22
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,180
What's all them little holes
then?

23
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,808
Well I don't know. Maybe Queen
Anne played darts.

24
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:56,337
Where's these lifts? I tell you what, I tell you what, I'm
considering letting the British Museum take a look at it.

25
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,062
Yeah? I'd let Rentokil have a
go first!

26
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,459
You don't know nothing about
antiques you, do you?

27
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,508
I mean, you know,
dealers they often put holes in little items

28
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,264
like these to give it that sort of 'distressed' look.

29
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,008
Distressed. Del, this thing
looks panic-stricken.

30
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,731
Where are these rotten lifts?

31
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,385
If those kids have jammed them
again I'm gonna clump their ear'oles.

32
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:26,236
I don't believe it. I don't
believe it.

33
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,134
Oh no, come on, Del, it was a complete accident,
look, it just come off in his hand.

34
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,655
What? You lying little git,
you ripped it off.

35
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,530
Now come along Grandad, tell
the truth for once.

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,209
I just don't believe this. This thing has survived the
Spanish Armada, the Black Death and the Blitz.

37
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,663
And then you two cack-handed sods come along

38
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:51,103
and in five minutes you've destroyed a piece of
our national heritage. I don't know.

39
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,500
- Morning Mr Trotter.
- Morning Mrs Murphy.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:04,288
Look you could - that was the lift weren't it?
Now what am I gonna do about this thing, eh?

41
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,046
I mean, you can't bodge about
with this sort of quality.

42
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,542
I mean, it's gonna take the
skills of a fully-trained furniture restorer.

43
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,767
Oh they ain't 'alf dear, Del
Boy.

44
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:14,757
Are they?

45
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,364
Here Rodney. Whip down to the
DIY shop and get a bag of nails, will you.

46
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,506
Here y'are

47
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:28,890
'Queen Anne cabinet. Genuine
antique, good as new.

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,652
Lovely condition throughout, a snip
at one hundred and forty five pounds.'

49
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:41,743
You could make the Elgin Marbles sound like a
second-hand Datsun, couldn't you?

50
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,646
Oi, how much of this stuff did
you sell today?

51
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,495
What d'you mean in pounds
sterling or in number of items?

52
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,246
Either.

53
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:48,751
- None.
- None?

54
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,713
People ain't interested Del.

55
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:52,676
Gordon Bennett Rodney.

56
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,894
I pick a prime site in the Arndale Centre
and you can't even get shot of a pair of pop-socks.

57
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:02,815
You wanna grow up a bit, my son. I suppose you spent all
day playing marbles with that mate Elgin of yours.

58
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:04,913
What?

59
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:09,101
What are you doing tomorrow Rodney?
You and Mickey Pearce playing five-stones?

60
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,084
You want to pull your socks
up you do, you know.

61
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:16,580
Del, these things look like
living bras that ain't been well.

62
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:21,174
Alright, alright, hang about -
don't knock the battery out.

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,027
Good evening. Miranda Davenport.

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,009
Miranda Davenport.

65
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:37,290
Ah yes, I think I know what
this is about.

66
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:40,411
Now if it was your Mercedes I backed into
the other day, I can assure you...

67
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,309
No, no, no, you obviously
haven't the faintest idea why I'm here.

68
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,586
I telephoned earlier about your newspaper ad
for the Queen Anne cabinet.

69
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,849
Oh gotcha.

70
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:53,873
Well, I left a message with an elderly gentleman,
he did sound somewhat vague.

71
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:57,746
Oh yes, yes, well he is rather
vague. He had a bang on the head you see.

72
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:59,577
Ah yes. When did it happen?

73
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:06,621
Soon. Do come in Miss
Davenport, or may I call you Miranda?

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,357
Well yes, I suppose so.

75
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,528
D'you know, Miranda is my most
favourite name?

76
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:11,372
Really?

77
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:15,105
Yeah. My name is Del, that's
short for Derek. How d'you do?

78
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:17,675
Please go in to the sitting
room will you. There you go.

79
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,274
Oi, Grandad.

80
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,887
Grandad, did somebody call
earlier about the cabinet?

81
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,690
Oh yes. She's coming round
this evening. Some posh tart.

82
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,881
Some posh tart. He's a card
ain't he?

83
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,030
Yes, isn't he just.

84
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:44,725
Rodney come on, clear this...
put your homework away would you Rodney?

85
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,476
Well, what do you think?

86
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:59,379
Very nice. Where is the Queen
Anne cabinet?

87
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,948
This - this is it.

88
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,135
This is the Queen Anne cabinet?

89
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,217
Oh yes, it's definitely a Queen Anne,
it's been given the once-over by experts.

90
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,537
Do you know anything about
antiques Miranda?

91
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:15,268
Yes. I run my own antique shop
in Chelsea.

92
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:20,341
Well, it might not be Queen
Anne.

93
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:25,319
It isn't. It's Queen Elizabeth,
circa 1955.

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,625
If you look inside you'll see, beneath
the dust and cobwebs, some faded lettering.

95
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,228
F...Y...

96
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:37,435
F...F...

97
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:39,653
Thank you, yes, Rodney...E
...S.

98
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,396
F...Y...F...F...Fiffes.
Fyffes.

99
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,627
Didn't they used to make
bananas?

100
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,906
That is correct.

101
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,189
So - so what does that
indicate then?

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,648
It indicates banana boxes of
course.

103
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,876
Maybe they were antique banana
boxes.

104
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,850
Alright, alright, thank you
very much, Grandad.

105
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,435
Why don't you go to your bedroom and
watch the 'Chinese Detective' on the portable? Go on.

106
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,303
Oh. Alright, I know where I'm
not wanted.

107
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,094
Well, go on then.

108
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:14,329
He never - never quite got over Suez.
Well, are you interested in it Miranda?

109
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,253
No, I'm afraid not Mr Trotter.

110
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,744
Well, what do you think we
should do with it then?

111
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,003
I'm not sure. Is there a tip
near here?

112
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,786
No there must be a wally somewhere
who'd want to buy it.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,010
Yeah, let's face it Del, you
bought it last week didn't you?

114
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:33,481
I say, that's rather pretty
isn't it?

115
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:38,250
That? You must be joking, it
gives me itchy fever every time I look at it.

116
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,193
I think it's rather sweet. Is
it for sale?

117
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:45,473
No - definitely not. No, you
see that is a family heirloom.

118
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:49,352
It belonged to my latedeparted Grandmother.
We couldn't possibly sell it, could we Rodney?

119
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:53,576
No, no, no way, no. It's
valuable then?

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,058
Oh no, no, it's worthless. I
just rather like it that's all.

121
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:02,938
You see, I'm redecorating my London flat and
I'm just on the look-out for little pieces like that.

122
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:05,220
Still, never mind...

123
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:10,983
Um, do you know, I'm really
rather in two minds about this cabinet now.

124
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,693
What - you think this might
have some potential do you, Miranda?

125
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,234
Well I'm really not sure.

126
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,389
But you see, what's persuading me is

127
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:20,786
that you're obviously a man
with an eye for this sort of thing.

128
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,139
Oh yes, petit Suisse.

129
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:29,419
Quite.  Whereas I'm just a woman
trying to make her way in the big wide world.

130
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,882
Oh yes, it's dog eat dog in
the antique game Miranda.

131
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:37,825
I know Derek - you'll most
probably say no –

132
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,284
but I was wondering whether you and I
could go into this together?

133
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,230
How d'you mean Miranda?

134
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,926
Well, I was thinking. We could take this
to the workroom at the back of my shop.

135
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:53,550
I have a very good man working there
who could possibly restore this to its former glory.

136
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:58,600
Repolish the top, varnish out
the lettering, some new brass handles,

137
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:03,800
and then we could put it in the shop and share
the profit. What d'you think?

138
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,716
I think that sounds just the ticket Miranda.

139
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,187
Mind you, I'd have to have a word with my partner.

140
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:11,744
Oh me?

141
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,311
Will you excuse us
while we confer?

142
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:22,139
Rodney, would you join me, I'd like to have
a word with you in the office?

143
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:23,228
What to, er...

144
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:32,670
Confer, yes. Excuse us. There you go.
Thank you, we'll be back in a couple of shakes, alright.

145
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:39,038
Well, if you want my opinion Del,
I don't think we should let that cabinet out of our sight.

146
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:44,531
That cabinet is definitely going to her shop to be
tarted up and sold for a ridiculously high profit.

147
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,139
End of discussion.

148
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:50,373
Good, good, well, there's
nothing like talking things out is there?

149
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:54,603
If you wasn't interested in my opinion,
what d'you drag me in here for?

150
00:09:54,782 --> 00:10:00,169
'Cos I want your advice,
Rodney, I think she fancies me.

151
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,009
- Miranda?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,587
Leave it out Del, she's an
intelligent woman.

153
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:11,109
I know she's an intelligent woman.
That is most probably why she fancies me.

154
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:15,307
True, true, yeah, well, I did
notice the way she looked at you.

155
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,433
- Yeah? How?
- What?

156
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,846
How, you know, how did she
look at me?

157
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,077
Well - sort of -

158
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,409
Like that.

159
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,770
Looks like she had
a hot chip in her mouth.

160
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:38,330
Del, I can't do a face like
hers, can I?

161
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:39,811
No, no I suppose not, no.

162
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,230
How am I going to tell her that -
you know - the 'feeling' is mutual?

163
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,619
- Just tell her.
- But how?

164
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:48,885
I don't know, do I?

165
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,110
You do, you're the one with
the GCEs.

166
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,506
Just be yourself.

167
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:56,645
Leave it out, Rodney, I wanna
be in with at least half a chance.

168
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:00,560
Del, for once in your life, be
you. Right.

169
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,624
And you won't need
none of them soppy French phrases neither.

170
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,899
What d'you mean, soppy French
phrases? La bonne vie, you stupid...

171
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:12,474
See what I mean? Del, you can't speak French.
You're still struggling with English.

172
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,565
What is it with you Rodney?
Do you like hospital food or something?

173
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:18,918
I'm just being honest with you.

174
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:23,366
Let's face it Del, most of your French phrases come
straight out of a Citroen manual, don't they?

175
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,649
A lot of people are
impressed by things like that.

176
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,603
Yeah, maybe the cave-men
down at the Nag's Head.

177
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:33,669
But it's not going to cut any ice
with Arthur Negus's youngest in there, is it?

178
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,978
I suppose you're right.

179
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:44,164
Del, if you're really that interested, why don't you just
give her a sign of your - mutual attraction.

180
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:48,592
- Yeah, a sign, eh?
- Yeah. And be yourself.

181
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,906
Yeah, yeah, yeah okay - yeah.
That's it.

182
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,172
He who dares, wins. Right.

183
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,863
Well, that is it Miranda.

184
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:03,873
I have discussed the matter with my partner
and we both agree that we shall exceed your delusions.

185
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,182
What?

186
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:08,498
You take that thing with you
and get it tarted up.

187
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:12,948
Oh good. Well, I'll telephone you
in the morning and arrange for it to be collected.

188
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,267
Yes, thank you.

189
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:30,303
- Fancy a curry?
- Why not?

190
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,282
My old guts are playing me up
this morning Rodney.

191
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,523
Yeah, I know.

192
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,938
I've got a touch of the old
Ghandi's revenge bruv.

193
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,350
What, from the Ruby last night?

194
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:01,565
Yeah.

195
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,438
Did Miranda enjoy it?

196
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:08,130
Well, she had a bit of aggro with the chicken tikka,
mind you it was a bit rubbery.

197
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,814
She was chewing on one bit for
about 'alf an hour –

198
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:13,992
I thought she'd end up blowing bubbles
with it any minute.

199
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,036
She's quite a sort, ain't she Rodney?

200
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,578
Yeah, she's alright.

201
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:23,660
What d'you mean, alright?
Alright? You wouldn't say no would yer, eh?

202
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:27,560
No she's quite taken with me an' all
you know.

203
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:30,501
No, she is, she's very
impressed.

204
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,454
Well, she knows I know a lot about antiques
don't she, eh?

205
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,187
Oh yeah, yeah, well, you've
been out with enough ain't yer?

206
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,765
Oi, that is enough of that.

207
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,787
Anyway listen, I went up her
shop this morning up Chelsea.

208
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:48,090
Real pukka establishment
Rodney, I mean, you know, real pukka.

209
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:53,684
Sort of place royals go. No, I think something
really good's gonna come out of this, bruv.

210
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:59,963
Do us a favour, Del. Look, don't get too carried away
with this Miranda sort, eh?

211
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,566
I mean, her type don't give a monkey's
for the likes of you.

212
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:07,370
What do you mean by that?

213
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,226
It means I've seen it all
before.

214
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,438
You meet someone you take a fancy to
and within a week

215
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:17,478
it's all wine and roses and 'I'm just popping down
to Bravington's Rodney.'

216
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,134
What do you think I am some
sort of whelk or something?

217
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:24,009
Still wet behind the ears? I
know exactly what I'm doing.

218
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,821
Nice one Derek, nice one
my son.

219
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,793
I must admit there is a
certain chemistry between me and Miranda.

220
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,554
I'm just gonna pop next door and get a
Dalton's Weekly, alright.

221
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,378
Fancy an Indian?

222
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,827
Fascist!

223
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:48,925
- Right, you fit then Rodders, eh?
- Yeah, yeah fit.

224
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,131
Here, you ain't 'arf got a
nasty rash coming up on your boat race.

225
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:58,272
Oh yeah, yeah that's, um,
that's just where I caught the sun, you know.

226
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,624
Well, if I didn't know any better I'd swear that someone
had smacked you right in the eye.

227
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,454
Alright don't go on about it.

228
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:08,885
What d'you mean? You're a
touchy little git sometimes ain't yer?

229
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:16,687
Here we are. That's it. Do
come in. There we are.

230
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:23,989
I'll get the door. Oh, allow me.
Thank you, there you are Miranda.

231
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:31,529
Sit yourself down on
the chaise longue and I'll fix us a drink.

232
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,726
What can I get you, port and lemon,
rum and coke? Or shall I surprise you?

233
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:43,631
Why don't you surprise me.

234
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:51,206
Right you are. There we go.
That was a blinding meal weren't it Miranda, eh?

235
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:56,373
Yes, it was very nice. I did
feel a bit over-dressed for a Berni Inn though.

236
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:02,672
I don't think so. I think we made quite an impression –
I mean everybody was looking at us.

237
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:13,399
- Take a sip of that Miranda.
- What is it?

238
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:18,668
That is called a Tequila Sunset.
Cheers.

239
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,278
It tastes of gin.

240
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,167
Yeah, I run out of Tequila.

241
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,446
Well, it's very nice.

242
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:33,290
Yeah, it is innit? I actually
got the recipe off a Mexican barman.

243
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,811
Have you been to Mexico?

244
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:37,585
No, no, he lives in the flat upstairs.

245
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,710
Miranda. I, well, I've been, thinking about us.

246
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:49,632
And I've...

247
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:58,889
Oh yes, sorry about that, it belongs to Rodney. He's into
still-life. He's got his GCE in Art you know.

248
00:17:59,155 --> 00:17:59,811
Really?

249
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:02,270
Oh yeah. He'll most probably
be famous when he's dead.

250
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,747
As I was saying - I've been
thinking about you and me.

251
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:08,978
Do you like art?

252
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:12,616
Oh yeah, it's triffic, I can't get enough of it.
You see the thing is that I was thinking...

253
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,769
- This is very strong.
- Yeah.

254
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,766
Do you like Cezanne?

255
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:19,053
Oh yes, a bit of ice and
lemonade, it's lovely.

256
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:25,996
You see, you and I have got, well, you know.
We've got a lot in common, haven't we?

257
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:30,043
I mean we're both - well - English.

258
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:32,252
I do love that painting.

259
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,649
Yeah, it's triffic innit?

260
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,938
Your grandmother must have had
very good taste.

261
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,816
No, she couldn't have had much,
she married my grandfather.

262
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,167
Do you like that painting
Derek?

263
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:44,087
What that? No, I hate it,
can't wait to get rid of it.

264
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:51,263
Oh don't ever throw it away, please. It would look so nice
in my flat. I'd hang it just above my bed.

265
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:55,552
Just try to picture it. Oh you can't -

266
00:18:55,705 --> 00:19:00,052
I've just remembered, you
haven't seen my bedroom...yet.

267
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:09,619
No, I haven't seen your bedroom...yet.

268
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:13,947
- You were saying?
- What?

269
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,259
You were talking about...us.

270
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,231
Oh yeah. Yeah - yeah.

271
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:20,587
Well, I was gonna say that I was
thinking about - well –

272
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:25,514
you know maybe later - you know -
not now - if you like in the future sometime,

273
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:32,891
when you, sort of felt like it, we
could, sort of, work closer together.

274
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,480
I've been thinking exactly the
same thing.

275
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,032
Have you?

276
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,861
Ever since I first met you.

277
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:47,879
Oh Miranda, drink up, I'll get
you another Tequila Sunset.

278
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,621
No really, I've had quite
enough.

279
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:03,119
Shall I put my
Richard Clayderman LP on?

280
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,360
No, I must be going.

281
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,006
I have to be up early in the morning,

282
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:12,676
Mummy and Daddy will probably ring first thing to wish me
happy returns. You know what parents are like.

283
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:17,985
No, I haven't had any for ages.
Sorry, did you say it's your birthday?

284
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,453
Yes. Surely I told you?

285
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,517
Oh, you haven't bought me a
present?

286
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:25,925
What?

287
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:32,152
Oh you really shouldn't have.
It's very sweet of you though, thank you.

288
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:40,595
I really must be off.

289
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,259
Sorry Gran.

290
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,505
Good morning Rodders, good
morning Grandfather.

291
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,170
It's a beautiful day out innit, eh?
Makes you glad to be alive, don't it?

292
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,604
Yeah, triffic.

293
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:09,103
Where you off to then Del?

294
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:14,410
I'm going out to Miranda's
shop. Just to see the cabinet.

295
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,177
What time's visiting hours
then?

296
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:22,050
There's nothing wrong with that cabinet, Rodney.
I keep on telling you, it's very nice cabinet.

297
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,804
Yeah, it is. I mean a million
wooodworms can't be wrong can they?

298
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:30,705
I've told you before Rodney,
there are no woodworms in that cabinet.

299
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,015
Whose birthday is it then Del?

300
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,185
Mine if I play my cards right!

301
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:40,743
'Happy birthday sweetheart,
from your ever loving Delly-Welly.'

302
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,461
Delly-Wally more like it.

303
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:52,087
Alright. Alright, put that
down and let's not have so much of it, shall we.

304
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:55,496
It's Miranda's birthday Rodney
and we forgot.

305
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:59,661
Oh no, what a choker, still
never mind.

306
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,393
What d'you get for her birthday Del?

307
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:04,106
Oh, nothing much!

308
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:07,029
What's happened to your Gran's
painting?

309
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:12,253
Eh? Well, I told you the sun
would fade it didn't I?

310
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:18,401
Sun, my arse, you've given it
to that tart ain't yer?

311
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,746
Well, she's not gonna raffle
it, is she? She'll only hang it on her bedroom wall.

312
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,412
Your Gran brought that
painting into this house Del.

313
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:27,198
There was an history behind
it, and you knew it.

314
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,637
You stole your own Grandmother's painting?

315
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:33,088
I didn't steal the painting.
Gran left that painting to me.

316
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,178
Don't give me that old Mother
Hubbbard.

317
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:39,146
She did. One night, when she
wasn't feeling too well, she said to me, she said,

318
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,938
'Del, when I go that painting is yours.'

319
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,149
I don't remember it.

320
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,591
No, you were out.

321
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,558
That's handy innit, no witnesses.

322
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,971
There were witnesses. There
was Mum and Rodney.

323
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,705
Mum ain't here any more.

324
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,400
I know that but Rodney is. You
remember don't you Rodney?

325
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:54,679
I can't say I do Del.

326
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:57,015
But you must remember. You
were there, over there in the corner.

327
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,708
With Mum...having yer
nappy changed.

328
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,040
Having his nappy cha...He
could have only been about four.

329
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,319
Exactly, how the hell do you
expect...Four???

330
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,685
I never thought I'd live to see the day when you,
you of all people, let the family down.

331
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:19,008
- I'm going to my room.
- Here, Grandad. Come on.

332
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,235
Here you are, look, have a
tenner, come on.

333
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:35,867
She's got you tied up like a turkey ain't she? You've
changed since you met her Del.

334
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:41,441
You've got more hooter than
Pinocchio. Just stay out of my life, will you.

335
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,815
Yeah, I'll stay out of your
life.

336
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:47,497
In fact, I think I can quite safely say that me and
Grandad won't ever get under your feet again.

337
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,660
I just hope Miranda suffers
with hay-fever.

338
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,706
- Rodney.
- What?

339
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,255
Don't be a plonker.

340
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,459
Did he leave that tenner?

341
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:44,169
Hello Harry. Is Miranda about?

342
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:47,579
No, she's popped down to Huddleton's Del.
Just down the road there, on yer left.

343
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:50,468
Right, I'll pop down and see
her. Here, how come you ain't open?

344
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:54,530
Had to close mate, we're being
fumigated, the place is full of woodworm.

345
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:58,097
You wanna watch that H.
Especially with your wooden leg!

346
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:14,801
2,200 - 2,500 - 2,700...

347
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,676
3,000.

348
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,629
The bid is with Gideon's
Gallery...

349
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,966
3,200.

350
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:31,228
3,400 - 3,500, the bid is with Gideon's.

351
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,065
3,600, with the gentleman at the back...

352
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:41,216
3,800, with Miss Davenport.

353
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,519
3,800 pounds. To Miss Davenport.

354
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,181
- Derek.
- Yeah.

355
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:00,675
What are you doing here?

356
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:04,870
I thought I'd just pop up and take you out to lunch,
you know, sort of birthday treat.

357
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:08,428
Birthday? Oh yes. How sweet.

358
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:11,809
These are for you. They're
daffodils.

359
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:13,681
So they are.

360
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,782
They used to be my Mum's
favourite.

361
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:22,490
Oh really? Well, thank you.
Look, I'm rather busy at the moment.

362
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,613
Why don't you wait for me at that little wine
bar round the corner?

363
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:28,880
Yeah, alright. Will you be
long?

364
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:30,617
How should I know?

365
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,781
Look, take these with you as
well please.

366
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:36,216
Yes - yeah, right.

367
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:43,815
Now, Lot 24 is this recently discovered work by the late
19th-century artist Joshua Blythe.

368
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,482
Now it's a particularly fine example of
his work

369
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:51,411
and I'd like to start the bidding at 7,000.
 Do I have 7,000?

370
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,433
7,000.

371
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,450
- You lied to me, didn't you?
- Nobody's perfect.

372
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,182
It's not your birthday at all,
is it?

373
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,742
It will be soon.

374
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:09,308
All you wanted me for was that
painting weren't it?

375
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,745
Well, what else did you think
I was interested in?

376
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:16,237
That banana box of a Queen Anne
cabinet? The damn thing's infested my entire stock.

377
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:21,676
No, I thought, you know, maybe
there was something else.

378
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,195
Did you honestly think I enjoyed being in the
company of a man who slapped my bottom,

379
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:36,450
called me sweetheart and assaulted my
digestive system with third-rate curries.

380
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:41,949
- Yeah.
- You must be a fool.

381
00:27:44,991 --> 00:27:47,821
Miranda, you should have told
me that you wanted to sell that painting.

382
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:52,082
Don't be ridiculous, I'm in business I realised how
valuable it was the moment I saw it.

383
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,276
Why should I tell you?

384
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,912
No, Miranda, you don't understand.

385
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:58,659
I think you're the one who's confused Derek.
And let's get one thing absolutely clear.

386
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:03,374
That painting is now mine.
It's been legally registered in my name.

387
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:05,739
Mummy and Daddy have even signed an affidavit

388
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:10,309
to swear that the painting has been
in our family for generations.

389
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:17,482
Thank Gawd for that. I've been
trying to get shot of that painting for years.

390
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,368
What do you mean?

391
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,964
I know exactly what that painting is
and I know exactly how much it's worth.

392
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:26,796
Rubbish. How could someone
like you possibly know that?

393
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,613
I'll tell you how I know that
shall I?

394
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:32,875
Because my Gran used to be a char-lady
to an art dealer. That's how I know.

395
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:36,938
Oh I see, and this Mrs Mopp
examined it did she?

396
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,582
No, she didn't examine it. She
nicked it!

397
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,088
17,600 pounds.

398
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:46,894
Good luck sweetheart.

399
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,302
