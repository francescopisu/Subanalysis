00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,756
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,592
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,554
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,140
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,768
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,229
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,277
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,988
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:43,459
IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,754

HOW FAST WERE
YOU GOING, MISS?

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,365
OH, 60, 65.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,993
BLOWOUT, SKID MARKS,

LADY, YOU'RE ON THE SIDE
OF THE ANGELS,

23
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,626
BY RIGHTS, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE CALLED FOR A MECHANIC.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,420
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE
CALLED FOR A HEARSE.

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,593
JUST FOLLOW ME
INTO TOWN, MISS.

26
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,804

IT'S CH EAPER THAN

40
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,235
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

NO.

00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,301
NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.

WHAT HITCHHIKER?

52
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,440
HE'S GONE NOW.

53
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,317
G U ESS HE GOT P ICKED UP.

54
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,861
PROBABLY.

55
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,280
IT'S FU N NY, THOUGH.
I SAW HIM A LITTLE WHILE AGO

56
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,282
WHILE YOU WERE CHANGING
THE TI RE.

57
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,119
YEAH, HE PROBABLY
GOT A LI FT RIGHT
AFTER WE PASSED HIM.

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,746

FOR ALL YOUR H ELP.

I SAW HIM AGAIN

65
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,756
AND THEN AGAIN ON THE LONG,

66
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,092
STRAIGHT STRETCH
THROUGH VIRGINIA.

67
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,012
JUST STANDING THERE.
NOT MENACING, REALLY.

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,391
IF ANYTHING, DRAB,
A LITTLE MOUSY.

69
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,728
JUST A SHABBY,
SILLY-LOOKING, SCARECROW MAN.

70
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,773
I SHOULDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT HIM AT ALL, BUT,

71
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,192
IT'S THE COINCIDENCE
OF THE THING.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,736
THE FACT THAT WHEREVER I GO,
THERE HE IS.

73
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,613
WHEREVER I STOP, I SEE HIM.

74
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,158
NO MATTER HOW FAR I TRAVEL
OR HOW FAST I GO,

75
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,535
HE'S AHEAD OF ME.

76
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,537
I'M ON A TURNPIKE NOW.

77
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,624
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS,
BUT I'M FRIGHTENED.

78
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,461
A FEAR JUST ABOUT AS VAGUE
AS ITS OBJECT.

79
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,588
MAYBE IT ISN'T REALLY A FEAR.

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,966
IT'S MORE JUST
A SENSE OF DISQUIET,

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,969
A FEELING THAT THINGS
ARE A LITTLE WRONG.

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,347
IT'S VAGUE BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT THAT HITCHHIKER IS.

83
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,391
HE'S VAGUE.

84
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,769
I WONDER WHY IT IS
HE'S ALWAYS THERE.

85
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,813
I WONDER WHY
I CAN'T SHAKE HIM.

86
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,233
DO YOU GET MANY
H ITCH H I KERS AROUND HERE?

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,156
IT COULDN'T BE NO RARE.

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,992
THE GUY WOULD BE A FOOL

ON A TURN P I KE.

00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,244
LOOK AT IT.

STOP AND PICK UP A GUY

94
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,502
WOULD YOU?

95
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,713
NO. I WOU DLN'T.

96
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,549
NOW A GUY MIGHT GET A RI DE
BEFORE THE TURN P I KE STARTS.

YOU KNOW, MAYBE
BY THE TOLL HOUSE
OR SOMETHING.

98
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,347
BUT EVEN THEN IT WOULD BE
A MIGHTY LONG RI DE.

99
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,808
MOST CARS WOULDN'T
WANNA PICK UP A GUY
FOR THAT LONG A RI DE.

IT'S GETTING SO--

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW.

I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD TURN
AROUND AND GO BACK TO NEW YORK

00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,308
AND I KNOW I'LL SEE HIM.

I'LL SEE HIM AT DETOURS,
AT RAILROAD CROSSINGS.

159

HE'LL BE LOOKING AT ME
AT STOPLIGHTS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW.

I JUST CAN'T STAY THERE

202
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,357
THERE'S A VERY
SUSP ICIOUS-LOOKING MAN THERE.

203
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,109
WHAT ABOUT THIS MAN?

204
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,694

BUT HE JUST STANDS THERE,

212
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,042
AND HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

213
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,627
THAT'S NOTHING

00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,927
I SAW YOUR CAR.

234
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,720
YOU KNOW, YOU LEFT

235
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,305

345
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,079
THAT'S WHY
I P ICKED YOU UP--
BECAUSE I LIKED YOU.

346
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,039
I THOUGHT
THAT WE COULD BE FRIENDS,

347
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,918
AND I'D KIND OF LIKE FOR YOU
TO TAKE ME OUT.

348
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,503
REALLY.

349
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,172
PLEASE?

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,593
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,265
BUT I'VE BEEN
SEEING THIS MAN.

353
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,101
HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME ALL
THE WAY ACROSS THE COU NTRY.

354
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,770
H ELP ME AND JUST STAY WITH ME

355
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,606
PLEASE DON'T GO!

356
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,359
PLEASE?

00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,947
JUST GIVE ME MY SHOES.

358
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,033
NOW, YOU LISTEN, HONEY.

359
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,827
WHAT YOU NEED IS
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

360
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,956
YOU DON'T NEED A BOYFRI EN D,
JUST A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

361
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,708
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

WHERE'S MY MOTH ER?

388
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,340
SHE'S STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

389
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,885
A N ERVOUS BREAKDOWN?
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THE MATTER WITH MY MOTH ER.

390
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,221
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A N ERVOUS BREAKDOWN?

391
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:52,393
WELL, IT'S ALL TAKEN PLACE
SINCE THE DEATH
OF HER DAUGHTER.

392
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,770
THE DEATH OF HER DAUG HTER?

393
00:21:54,855 --> 00:22:00,735

WHAT NUMBER IS THIS?

396
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,866
IT'S ALL BEEN VERY SUDDEN.

397
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,577
NAN WAS KILLED
JUST SIX DAYS AGO

398
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,747
IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

399
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:18,169
A TIRE BLEW OUT
AND HER CAR TURNED OVER.

400
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,221
(Adams, off)
VERY ODD.

401
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,016
THE FEAR HAS LEFT ME NOW.

402
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,853
I'M NUMB, I HAVE NO FEELING.

403
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:40,816
IT'S AS IF SOMEONE HAD PULLED
OUT SOME KIND OF A PLUG IN ME

404
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,696
AND EVERYTHING, EMOTION,
FEELING, FEAR,
HAS DRAINED OUT.

405
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:50,534
AND NOW I'M A COLD SHELL.

406
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,746
I'M CONSCIOUS OF THINGS
AROUND ME NOW--

407
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,624
THE VAST NIGHT OF ARIZONA,

408
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,461
THE STARS THAT LOOK DOWN
FROM THE DARKNESS.

409
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,131
AHEAD OF ME STRETCH
A THOUSAND M ILES
OF EMPTY MESA--

410
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,010
MOUNTAINS, PRAIRIES, DESERT.

411
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,722
SOMEWHERE AMONG THEM,
HE'S WAITING FOR ME.

412
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,351
SOMEWHERE I'LL FIND OUT
WHO HE IS.

413
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,312
I'LL FIND OUT.

414
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,191
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS.

415
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:28,948
BUT JUST NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME

416
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,451
LOOKING OUT AT THE NIGHT

417
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:38,499
I THINK I KNOW.

418
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,432
I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING

419
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,892

(male narrator)
NAN ADAMS, AGE 27.

421
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:04,442
SHE WAS DRIVING TO CALIFORNIA,
TO LOS ANGELES.

422
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,360
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

423
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,404
THERE WAS A DETOUR

424
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,323
THROUGH THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

THE PECU LIAR FEELING

431
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,937
THAT THIS IS A MACHINE
WITH A MIND AND WI LL
OF ITS OWN.

432
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,106
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN EVERETT SLOAN

00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,692
CONTRACTS A FATAL AILMENT
