THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,426
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,721
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,181
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,310
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,604
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,233
AND IT LIES BETWEEN THE PIT
OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,986
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,655
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,743
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

THESE ARE THE FACES
OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO FIGHT.

20
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,007
AS IF SOME OMNISCIENT PAINTER
HAD M IXED A TUBE OF OILS

THAT WERE AT ONE TIME
EARTH-BROWN, DUST-GREY

BLOOD-RED, BEARD-BLACK,
AND FEAR, YELLOW-WHITE.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,226
AND THESE MEN WERE THE MODELS.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,187
FOR THIS IS THE PROVINCE
OF COMBAT

25
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,565

00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,052
MAKE SURE THEY GOT
HOT COFFEE AND A MEAL.

IT DOES TO A MAN'S OUTLOOK.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

64
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,246
WELL, F ITZ,
WE'VE LOST FOUR MEN BEFORE.

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,456
WE'VE LOST EIGHT AND TEN.

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,043
YOU SEEM TO BE TAKING THIS
A LITTLE HARDER THAN USUAL.

67
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,421
I JUST WON DERED
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING

68
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,923
SPECIAL.

69
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,967
THESE FOUR MEN
WERE ALL U N DER 2 1.

00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,427
DOES IT HAVE TO BE
MORE SPECIAL THAN THAT?

71
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,805
NO, BUT THIS HAS
GOTTEN TO YOU, FITZ.

72
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,390
MORE THAN I'VE EVER SEEN.

73
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,308
I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

74
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,271
YOU'RE A PERCEPTIVE MAN, PH I L.

75
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,565
IT'S THE MARK OF A GOOD
OFFICER, ISN'T IT?

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,110
TO WARD OFF TROU BLE
BY ANTICI PATING.

77
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,239
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME
A HARD TIME?

78
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,074
I DON'T THINK SO, F ITZ.

79
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,742
YOU'RE A GOOD OFFICER.

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,730
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ME, PHIL,

00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,150
I WROTE THOSE NAMES
DOWN YESTERDAY.

90
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,278
I WROTE THEM DOWN
BEFORE WE WENT UP.

91
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:25,449
WHY DID YOU WRITE DOWN
THE NAMES, F ITZ?

92
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,284
WELL, WE HAD A WEAPONS CHECK

93
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,328
AND I LOOKED INTO THEIR FACES

94
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,538
AND THOSE FOUR MEN

95
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,749

00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,812
I LOOKED INTO FORTY FOU R
FACES YESTERDAY MORNING

99
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,359
AND WHEN I GOT TO THOSE FOU R,
THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL

100
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,735
A LIGHT OR SOMETHING.

101
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,653
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.

102
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,572
THERE ISN'T ANY DESCRIPTION.

103
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,741
I LOOKED INTO THEIR
FACES AND I KNEW.

104
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,952
I KNEW THIS
WAS THEIR LAST DAY.

105
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,163
I KNEW THEY WERE
GOING TO GET IT.

106
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,664
I KNEW, AND THERE

107
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,459
THERE WASN'T
ANY DOU BT ABOUT IT.

108
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,295
WELL, THAT'S, UH,

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,255
THAT'S FU N NY.
THAT'S REAL FU N NY.

00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,011
I HAVEN'T SLEPT MUCH.

111
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,932
I KEEP WON DERING

112
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,852
IS THIS THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE?

113
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,605
IF EVERY TIME I STAND
IN FRONT OF A PLATOON

114
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,274
AM I GOING TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK DOWN THE LIN E

115
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,902
AND KNOW WHICH ONES
AREN'T COMING BACK?

116
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,446
F ITZ, WHEN DID YOU WRITE
THESE NAMES DOWN?

117
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,407
YOU'RE SURE IT WAS YESTERDAY?

118
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,618
YOU'RE SURE IT WASN'T TODAY
ON THE WAY BACK IN THE TRUCK?

119
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,453
YESTERDAY.

120
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,539
YESTERDAY MORNING,
I SWEAR TO YOU.

121
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,208
I WROTE THOSE

I CAN'T TELL, CAPTAIN.

124
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,557
THE STUFF YOU'VE GIVEN ME
IS INCONCLUSIVE.

125
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,101
I LOOKED UP HIS RECORDS.
HE'S NEVER BEEN WOU N DED.

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,900
WHY HE SHOU LD SU DDEN LY GET
THIS WE I RD IDEA IS HARD TO SAY

129
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,944
BUT WE BETTER RU N SOME CHECKS.

130
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,447
HE BELIEVES IT.
YOU HEAR HIM TELL IT

131
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,407
YOU ALMOST BELIEVE IT YOURSELF.

132
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,826
I'D APPRECIATE YOU
TAKING A LOOK AT HIM.

133
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,453
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

134
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,498
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST
OFFICERS WE'VE GOT.

135

HE'S HERE NOW, YOU KNOW.

137
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,545
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,642
DOC SAID H E'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

175
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,935
NO, HE ISN'T.

176
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,396
I TOOK A LOOK AT HIS FACE.

177
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,026
I TOOK A LOOK AT HIS FACE,
AND I KNEW.

178
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,236
AND A MINUTE LATER,
HE'S GON E.

179
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,613
SAME THING?

180
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,197
SAME THING.

181
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,283
THE LOOK.

182
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,829
THE FU N NY--
THE FU N NY LIGHT
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

183
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,416
AND I KNEW,
AND I KNEW.

184
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,128
F ITZ, I CAN'T
EXPLAIN THIS, BUT--

185
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,547
I DON'T WANT
YOU TO EXPLAIN IT.

186
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,966
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT?

187
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,136
HOW CAN ANYBODY
EXPLAIN IT?

188
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,265
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BELIEVE IT, CAPTAI N.
THAT'S ALL I WANT FROM YOU.

189
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,351
I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE IT.

190
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,021
(Paramedic)
BED FIVE, SIR.
SM ITH. HE JUST DIED.

191
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,190
I'LL HAVE
A LOOK AT HIM.

192
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:54,152
FOR WHAT?

193
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,613
(Fitz)
THERE'S NOTHING
TO LOOK AT BUT A BODY.

194
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,031
HE'S DEAD.

195
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,491
AND I KNEW
HE WAS GOING TO DIE

196
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,159
'CAUSE I READ IT
ON HIS FACE.

197
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,536
GO ON BACK,
CORPORAL. I'LL
BE RIGHT IN.

198
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,871
SO YOU KNEW,
LI EUTENANT?

199
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,331
YOU BET I DID.

200
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,249
I TABBED FOUR MEN
THE OTHER DAY.

201
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,126
THAT'S ODD,
DON'T YOU THINK?

202
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,796
(Fitz)
ODD? THAT'S
NOT ODD, CAPTAIN.

203
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,714
ODD WHEN IS YOU GO
30 DAYS ON THE LINE

204
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,007
AND YOU DON'T
LOSE A MAN.

205
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,093
THAT'S ODD!

206
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,137
ODD IS WHEN YOU WALK
25 MILES AND YOU DON'T
GET A BLISTER.

207
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,139
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ODD!

208
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,141
THIS ISN'T ODD, CAPTAI N.

209
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,768
THIS IS NIGHTMARE.

210
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,062
THIS IS A LOUSY,
DOG-FACED, LYING OFFICER

211
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,022
WHO CAN SEE DEATH
ON PEOPLE'S FACES.

212
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,400
(Doctor)
YOU'RE A DOG-FACED,
LYING OFFICER

213
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,610
WHO'S CRACKING U N DER
THE STRAIN FROM HAVING
DONE TOO MUCH

214
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,737
AND FELT TOO MUCH.
F I NALLY HAVING TO
SUCCU M B TO IT!

215
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,614
I'M FIVE
FOR FIVE, CAPTAI N.

216
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,866
HOW MANY CO I NCI DENCES
ADD UP TO A FACT?

217
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,868
HOW MANY MEN
DO I HAVE TO TAB

218
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,745
AS THE LEAST LIKELY
TO SUCCEED?

219
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,123
HOW MANY MORE FACES
DO I HAVE TO LOOK INTO?!

220
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,874
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW

221
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,544
IS WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO MAKE YOU GUYS REALIZE

222
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,337
THAT SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE LIN E

223
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,215
I P ICKED UP A TALENT
THEY DON'T TEACH AT O.C.S.

224
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,758
ONE THING YOU MIGHT DO

225
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,927
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
AND SCRATCHING

226
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,972
YOU MIGHT PUT
TAPE OVER MY EYES
OR POKE THEM OUT

227
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,767
OR DO SOMETHING
WHERE I WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE

228
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,061
SO I WON'T
HAVE TO LOOK
AT ANY MORE FACES!

229
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,293
NOW WE SPEARH EAD
THE ATTACK MOVING
ACROSS AT THE PO I NT

230
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,754
FOLLOWED BY BAKER
AND CHARLIE AND COM PANY.

231
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,256
NOW, AT THIS PO I NT
TO THE EAST,

232
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,843
SOME F I LI P I NO
G U ERRI LLAS WILL BE
CROSSING THE RIVER BY BOAT.

233
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,554
NOW THEIR JOB
WILL BE TO KNOCK OUT
ANY AND ALL JAP GUNS

234
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,433
IN THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER.
SO THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MOVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE

235
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,435
AGAINST ONLY
SMALL ARMS FIRE.

236
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,440
WE'VE GOT ABOUT
22 MINUTES BEFORE
WE LOAD UP THE TRUCKS.

237
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,984
GIVE YOUR PLATOONS
A GOOD BRI EFING.

238
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:03,323
MAKE SURE THAT EACH MAN
HAS A BELT, FIVE GRENADES,
SIX AM MO CLI PS,

239
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,241
AND NO BACKPACKS.

240
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,619
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT.
GOOD LUCK.

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,754
CAPTAI N,

242
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,507
YOU STILL WANT MY PLATOON
TO TAKE THE PO I NT?

00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,634
I DON'T KNOW YET, F ITZ.

244
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,803

[suspense music]

246
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,517
WHAT'S THE MATTER, F ITZ?

247
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,276
ARE YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO TAKE THE PLATOON?

THIS THING WILL TAKE
A FEW HOURS BUT IT

251
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,452
CAPTAI N, YOU BETTER NOT GO.

252
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,120
WHY, F ITZ?

253
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,667

IT'S ON YOUR FACE TOO.

IF YOU GO,
YOU WON'T BE COMING BACK.

WE'LL DRINK
