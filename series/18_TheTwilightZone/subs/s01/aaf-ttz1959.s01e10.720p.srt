1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,005
[eerie music]

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,340
(male presenter)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,843
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:14,013
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,849
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,185
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,563
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,610
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,447
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,284
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,378
HER NAME IS THE
S.S. QUEEN OF GLASGOW.

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,590
HER REGISTRY: BRIT'SH.
GROSS TONNAGE: 5,000.

14
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,633
AGE: INDETERMINATE.

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,386
AT THIS MOMENT,
SHE'S ONE DAY
OUT OF LIVERPOOL.

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,889
HER DESTINATION: NEW YORK.

17
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,100
DULY RECORDED
ON THIS SHIP'S LOG
IS THE SAILING TIME,

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,561
COURSE TO DESTINATION,
WEATHER CONDITIONS,

19
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,730
TEMPERATURE,
LONGITUDE
AND LATITUDE.

20
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,399
BUT WHAT IS NEVER
RECORDED IN A LOG

21
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:12,446
IS THE FEAR THAT
WASHES OVER A DECK
LIKE FOG AND OCEAN SPRAY.

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,576
FEAR LIKE THE THROBBING
STROKES OF ENGINE PISTONS,
EACH LIKE A HEARTBEAT,

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,246
PARCELING OUT EVERY HOUR
INTO BREATHLESS MINUTES
OF WATCHING,

24
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,916
WAITING AND DREADING.

25
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,418
FOR THE YEAR IS 1 942.

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,463
AND THIS PARTICULAR SHIP
HAS LOST ITS CONVOY.

27
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,257
IT TRAVELS ALONE
LIKE AN AGED BLIND THING

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,760
GROPING THROUGH
THE UNFRIENDLY DARK

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,847
STALKED BY UNSEEN
PERISCOPES OF STEEL
KILLERS.

30
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,642
YES, THE QUEEN OF GLASGOW
IS A FRIGHTENED SHIP,

31
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,355
AND SHE CARRIES WITH HER
A PREMONITION OF...DEATH.

32
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,500
LIGHTS IN THE SALON.

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,461
LET'S BLACKOUT DOWN THERE.

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,299
SIR?

35
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,512
THEY'LL BE FINISHED
SERVING DINNER
SOON, SIR.

36
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,807
YOU'D BEST GO IN
IF YOU WANT TO EAT.

37
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,433
THANK YOU.

38
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,685
YES, SIR.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,791
THANK YOU.

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,840
ARE YOU LANSER?

41
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,550
YES.

42
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,011
JERRY POTTER.
WE LOOKED FOR
YOU AT DINNER.

43
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,723
SAW YOUR NAME ON THE PURSER'S
LIST. WE WERE WONDERING
WHERE YOU WERE.

44
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,393
THE CAPTAIN WASN'T ABLE
TO JOIN US TONIGHT. COME
OVER AND HAVE DESSERT.

45
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,104
THANK YOU, NO.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,231
HOW ABOUT SOME
COFFEE, SIR?

47
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,942
THANK YOU, I WOULD
LIKE A CUP OF COFFEE.

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,361
HERE'S YOUR SEAT
RIGHT OVER HERE,
MR. LANSER.

49
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,906
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,782
WE COULD DO
WITH A BIT
OF MERRIMENT.

51
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,785
I'LL DO THE HONORS.
THIS IS MAJOR DEVEREAUX.

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,412
HOW DO YOU DO?

53
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,331
AND HIS SECRETARY,
MISS STANLEY.

54
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,043
ARE YOU HEADING
HOME, MR. LANSER,
OR AWAY FROM HOME?

55
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,756
WHY, I'M...HEADING
AWAY FROM HOME.

56
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,259
UM, WHAT DO
YOU DO, LANSER?

57
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,595
ME?

58
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,057
I SAW YOUR NAME ON THE LIST.
I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE.

59
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,558
IT'S A GAME I PLAY.

60
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,977
I TRY TO CONNECT
A FACE WITH A NAME.

61
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,981
I THOUGHT PROBABLY
YOU WERE AN OLD
LANGUAGE PROFESSOR

62
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,275
FROM OXFORD
OR SOMETHING.

63
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,322
AH, HERE COMES
THE CAPTAIN.

64
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,912
OH, NO, NO, NO.
PLEASE, DON'T GET UP.

65
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,916
I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HELLO TO SOME OF YOU.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,794
I DO APOLOGIZE
FOR NOT BEING ABLE
TO GET DOWN TO DINNER.

67
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,338
WE HAVE A MISERABLE
FOG OUT THERE,

68
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,924
AND I THOUGHT IT BEST
TO TAKE MY MEAL
ON THE BRIDGE.

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,677
AND THE REST OF
THE CONVOY, CAPTAIN,
ARE THEY IN SIGHT?

70
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,596
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE
THREE FEET OFF THE BOW
TO BE IN SIGHT, MAJOR.

71
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,099
THAT FOG OUT THERE
IS VERY THICK.

72
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,977
WE HAVE SOME HOPES
OF MAKING CONTACT
WITH THEM TOMORROW.

73
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,813
I'D FEEL MUCH SAFER
IF WE WERE IN CONVOY.

74
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,940
I CAN ALMOST SEE
THOSE WOLF PACKS--

75
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,026
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU CALL THEM?
CONVERGING ON US.

76
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,697
THERE'LL BE NO WOLF
PACKS CONVERGING ON A
SINGLE SHIP, MAJOR DEVEREAUX.

77
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,285
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE
SUBMARINE PACK IS BASED
ON THE CONVOY ATTACK.

78
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,706
THE GENTLEMAN IS QUITE CORRECT.
OUR PRINCIPAL DANGER WOULD LIE
IN A SINGLE SUBMARINE.

79
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,874
I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,128
I'D RATHER THEY GO
AFTER US IN ONE OF
THOSE POCKET BATTLESHIPS.

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,340
THAT YOU CAN SEE.
NOT A SKULKING,
CRUMMY TIN FISH

82
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,342
A COUPLE OF M ILES
UNDER WATER.

83
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,970
IF YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED,
YOU'LL SEE THE SUB,
MR. POTTER.

84
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,848
IT WILL SURFACE.
THEY WON'T USE ALL OF
THEIR TORPEDOES ON US.

85
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,101
NOT WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE
THOUSAND YARDS AND SHELL US
WITH IMPUNITY

86
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,270
AND SINK US AT WILL.

87
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,025
YOU'LL FORGIVE
ME, MISTER--

88
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,402
THIS IS
MR. LANSER, CAPTAIN.

89
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,323
MR. LANSER, BUT YOU
SOUND RATHER LIKE
A U-BOAT COMMANDER.

90
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,041
FORGIVE ME. THAT
WAS CLUMSY OF ME.

91
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,501
I HOPE I DIDN'T
GET ANY ON YOU,
MISS STANLEY.

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,255
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T GET ANY
ON ME, BUT YOU DID QUITE A
JOB ON YOURSELF THERE.

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,506
THAT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT.

94
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,716
IT'LL STAIN, SIR.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,510
I SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT!

96
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,013
(Steward)
YES, SIR.

97
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,016
AS YOU SAY, SIR.
CAN I GET YOU SOME
MORE COFFEE?

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,101
NO, THANK YOU. THAT
WON'T BE NECESSARY.

99
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,853
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

100
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,607
WON'T YOU PLEASE SIT
DOWN, MR. LANSER?

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,946
WELL, I THINK WE CAN
START TO GET BETTER
ACQUAINTED NOW.

102
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,949
FIRST OF ALL, I HOPE
YOU'RE ALL AS COMFORTABLE
AS POSSIBLE.

103
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,619
THIS SHIP WAS NOT DESIGNED
TO CARRY PASSENGERS.

104
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,580
AND I HOPE YOU'LL BEAR
WITH ANY LITTLE
INCONVENIENCES.

105
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,750
MR. POTTER, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE WITH THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT?

106
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,919
WAR PRODUCTION BOARD.

107
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,296
AND WHERE IS
HOME, MR. POTTER?

108
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,591
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.
THE WINDY CITY.

109
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,052
I'LL TELL YOU
I'LL BE GLAD TO
GET TO SEE HER, TOO.

110
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,055
AND YOU, MR. LANSER?

111
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,057
WHERE IS HOME FOR YOU?

112
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,062
HOME?

113
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,814
UH--

114
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,483
I WAS BORN IN FRANKFURT.

115
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,986
FRANKFURT? FRANKFURT,
LIKE IN GERMANY?

116
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,407
YES, GERMANY.

117
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,784
HOW LONG HAD YOU
BEEN IN ENGLAND?

118
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,371
HOW LONG? UH--

119
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,626
NOT VERY LONG.

120
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,755
AND NOT LONG AT ALL.

121
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,469
UH, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I'M NOT FEELING
WELL TODAY.

122
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,680
I THINK I'D BETTER
GO TO MY CABIN.

123
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,933
THAT'S TOO BAD, LANSER.
I WAS HOPING WE M IGHT
GET UP A POKER GAME.

124
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,810
PERHAPS LATER,
IF YOU FEEL BETTER.

125
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,854
YES, PERHAPS LATER,
GOOD NIGHT.

126
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,439
GOOD NIGHT,
MR. LANSER.

127
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,065
GOOD NIGHT.

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,163
MISS STANLEY?

129
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,004
THE FOG CARRIES A CHILL
WITH IT, DOESN'T IT?

130
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,047
YES, YES, IT DOES.

131
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,175
HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

132
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,718
I DON'T THINK SO.

133
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,180
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.

134
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,016
YOU LOOKED SO FAM ILIAR.

135
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,730
BUT FOR THAT MATTER,
THEY ALL DID.

136
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,690
MR. LANSER, ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?

137
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,650
YES, YES,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

138
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,237
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
THESE CRAZY FEELINGS.

139
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,615
WHAT?

140
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,159
A FEELING
OF DOING THINGS,

141
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,036
SAYING THINGS.

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,705
A FEELING THAT YOU'VE
DONE THEM BEFORE?

143
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,000
I KNOW THAT FEELING.
I'VE HAD IT OCCASIONALLY.

144
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,085
BEING IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE

145
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,214
AND BEING ABLE
TO SWEAR THAT YOU'D
BEEN THERE BEFORE.

146
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:32,385
EVEN THE CONVERSATION
SEEMS IDENTICAL
TO ANOTHER TIME.

147
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,221
AND THE PEOPLE?

148
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,015
YES, AND THE PEOPLE, TOO.

149
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,976
HOW ODD.

150
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,106
I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL.

151
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,610
I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL

152
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,905
GETTING ON THIS SHIP

153
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,784
OR ANYTHING ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER.

154
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,788
IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF
I WOKE UP AND FOUND
MYSELF STANDING ON DECK

155
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,416
AND HEARING YOUR VOICES

156
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,460
COMING FROM THE SALON.

157
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,920
LIKE AMNESIA?

158
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,548
NO, NOT REALLY.
I KNOW WHO I AM.

159
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,926
I'M CARL LANSER.
I AM CARL LANSER.

160
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,096
I WAS BORN IN
FRANKFURT, GERMANY.
I AM IN THE--

161
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,893
IN THE WHAT?

162
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,437
YOU WERE GOING
TO TELL ME.

163
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,649
YOU WERE IN
SOMETHING OR OTHER.

164
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,360
WHO WAS I?

165
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,781
I DON'T REMEMBER.

166
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,993
MR. LANSER, PERHAPS
IF YOU GOT SOME SLEEP.

167
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,329
NO, SLEEP COULDN'T HELP ME.
I DON'T THINK I COULD
GET TO SLEEP.

168
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,665
I FEEL AS IF--

169
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,961
AS IF... I'M
IN A NIGHTMARE.

170
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,422
IT'S SO STRANGE.

171
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,593
I FEEL AS IF THERE'S
DISASTER OUT THERE.

172
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,596
DOOM.

173
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,140
WE ARE BEING STALKED.

174
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,852
I KNOW WE'RE
BEING STALKED.

175
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,105
THERE IS A SUB
OUT THERE, A U-BOAT.

176
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,857
I KNOW.

177
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,693
I KNOW IT'S THERE.
I KNOW IT.

178
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,820
MR. LANSER?

179
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,323
I'M LANSER.

180
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,201
THE CAPTAIN'S COMPLIMENTS, SIR.
HE WONDERS IF YOU'D COME
WITH ME TO THE BRIDGE.

181
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,120
HE'D LIKE TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH YOU.

182
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,622
CERTAINLY.

183
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,582
WILL YOU FOLLOW
ME, PLEASE, SIR?

184
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,131
THANK YOU FOR
COMING UP, MR. LANSER.

185
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:37,052
I WONDER IF YOU'D M IND
ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.

186
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,471
NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

187
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,807
FIRST OF ALL, WOULD
YOU M IND SHOWING ME
YOUR PASSPORT?

188
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,893
MY-MY PASSPORT?

189
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,020
YES, IF YOU
DON'T M IND.

190
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,522
JUST ROUTINE, SIR.
ON OUR PASSENGER MANIFEST

191
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,692
IT SEEMS THAT YOUR
PASSPORT NUMBER WAS
NOT PUT DOWN.

192
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:57,155
I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE
MY WALLET WITH ME HERE.
I MUST'VE LEFT IT IN MY CABIN.

193
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,659
IT'S ALL RIGHT. SOMETIME
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS
YOU SHOW IT TO ME.

194
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,994
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MR. LANSER? I MEAN,

195
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,831
IS THERE ANYTHING,
WELL, ANYTHING THAT
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

196
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:11,211
THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT
I CAN TELL YOU AS I DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

197
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,505
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW I GOT ON THIS SHIP.

198
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,590
I DON'T RECALL
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

199
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,679
I SEEM TO REMEMBER ONLY
ODD, DISJOINTED THINGS.

200
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,265
I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE
THAT MY NAME IS
CARL LANSER.

201
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,935
I KNOW THAT I WAS
BORN IN FRANKFURT.

202
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,353
GO ON, MR. LANSER.

203
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,021
GO ON, GO ON, HOW?

204
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,191
IT SEEMS TO BE
ALL THAT I KNOW.

205
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,404
WELL, AT THE TABLE
YOU SEEMED TO SHOW A
REMARKABLE WORKING KNOWLEDGE

206
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,031
OF GERMAN SUBMARINES.

207
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,617
COULD THAT PERHAPS
GIVE YOU A THOUGHT?

208
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,123
I'M AFRAID IT COULDN'T.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO.

209
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,919
GO TO BED, MR. LANSER.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW, YOU AND I.

210
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,629
ALL RIGHT.

211
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,466
THAT'S ALL,
MR. LANSER.
GOODNIGHT.

212
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,343
GOODNIGHT.

213
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,143
ODD. VERY ODD.

214
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,437
I'D SAY THAT
HE BEARS WATCHING.

215
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,731
SEE THAT A STEWARD IS
SENT DOWN TO HIS CABIN.

216
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,816
I WANT TO HAVE A LOOK
AT HIS PASSPORT.

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,985
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

218
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,116
I BELIEVE
THAT'S IT, SIR.

219
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,410
ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO TO HELP?

220
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,245
OH, I DIDN'T SEE THIS.

221
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,083
WAR SOUVENIR, SIR?

222
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,127
BEG YOUR PARDON?

223
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,505
UH, THIS, SIR.
I WAS WONDERING IF
IT WAS A WAR SOUVENIR.

224
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,215
WAR SOUVENIR?

225
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,801
UH, YES, SIR.
GERMAN NAVAL
OFFICER'S CAP.

226
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,262
SUBMARINE COMMANDER,
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SIR.

227
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,806
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING
THAT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

228
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,684
TERRIBLY SORRY, SIR.
I THOUGHT IMIGHT
HANG IT UP FOR YOU.

229
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,145
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
I'LL HANG IT UP MYS--

230
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,550
McCLOUD, CAPTAIN HERE.

231
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,469
WE'VE SIMPLY GOT
TO HAVE MORE REVS.

232
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,138
IF YOU CAN GIVE
ME MAXIMUM SPEED
FOR 1 2 MORE HOURS.

233
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,016
CAPTAIN, THESE ENGINES
NEEDED AN OVERHAUL
TWO MONTHS AGO.

234
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,393
INSTEAD OF THAT,
THEY'RE GETTING
WORKED TO DEATH.

235
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,312
ALL RIGHT, McCLOUD,
DO WHAT YOU CAN.

236
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,314
AYE, AYE, SIR.

237
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,150
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
PRETTY CHEERFUL
DEAL WE'VE GOT HERE.

238
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,737
REDUCE SPEED AND GIVE
THOSE ENGINES A BREAK AND
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

239
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,241
RUN THEM AT MAXIMUM
AND THEY'LL SEIZE UP
WITHIN TWO HOURS.

240
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,409
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE.

241
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,079
GOD KNOWS,
THEY'RE OUT THERE

242
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,542
WAITING LIKE VULTURES.

243
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,055
BEGGING YOUR PARDON, SIR,
BUT IT'S-IT'S VERY LATE.

244
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,103
THEY DON'T SOUND RIGHT.

245
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,563
SIR?

246
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,232
THE ENGINES.
THEY SOUND LABORED.

247
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,860
THEY ALWAYS SOUND
LIKE THAT, SIR.

248
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,237
YOU GET USED TO IT
AFTER A BIT ON THIS TUB.

249
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,739
HA! YOU SHOULD HEAR
McCLOUD ON THE SUBJECT.

250
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,033
HE'S THE ENGINEER,
YOU KNOW.

251
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:33,705
HE SAYS THAT THESE ENGINES
WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED
FOR LORD NELSON.

252
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,041
IT'S FIVE
AFTER TWELVE.

253
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,044
FIVE PAST TWELVE.

254
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,882
1 : 1 5.

255
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,800
BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR?

256
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,970
1 : 1 5.

257
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,639
SOMETHING'S GOING
TO HAPPEN AT 1 : 1 5.

258
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,808
SOMETHING'S GOING
TO HAPPEN, SIR?

259
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,019
I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

260
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,814
EXCEPT--

261
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,693
EXCEPT 1 : 1 5.
IT STICKS IN MY M IND.

262
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,035
TRAY TO THE
BRIDGE, PLEASE.

263
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,162
JUST BEING
MADE UP, SIR.
BE DONE IN A M INUTE.

264
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,331
I'LL WAIT.

265
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,541
[engines stop]

266
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,379
THE ENGINES
HAVE STOPPED.

267
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,256
WHY HAVE THE
ENGINES STOPPED?

268
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,008
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST ROUTINE, SIR.

269
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,677
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
THEY'VE BROKEN DOWN.

270
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,305
OH, I DON'T THINK
IT'S SERIOUS, SIR.

271
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,933
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'iS SERIOUS?

272
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,978
ADRIFT IN WATERS LIKE THESE
WITHOUT ANY POWER, YOU DON'T
THINK THAT'S SERIOUS?

273
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,773
WE'RE DEFENSELESS. WE'RE
ABSOLUTELY DEFENSELESS!

274
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,817
OH, THEY'LL BE REPAIRED, SIR.
WE'LL BE UNDERWAY AGAIN SOON.

275
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,528
NO, WE WON'T BE
UNDERWAY SOON.

276
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,697
WE WILL DRIFT

277
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:55,745
UNTIL 1 : 1 5.

278
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,918
[engines start]

279
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,212
[engines stop]

280
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,308
THE U-BOAT'S COM ING.

281
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,394
WE HAVE TO GET
THE ENGINES STARTED.

282
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,563
NO, WE MUST ABANDON
SHIP. YES! THAT'S
WHAT WE MUST DO.

283
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,402
WE MUST ABANDON SHIP, YES!
WE MUST ABANDON SHIP.

284
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,342
IT'S HERE!

285
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,345
THAT'S THE U-BOAT
OUT THERE!

286
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,850
THE U-BOAT'S HERE.

287
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,984
THE U-BOAT'S HERE!

288
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,236
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE, EVERYBODY!

289
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,281
WE HAVE GOT TO LEAVE
THE SHIP! EVERYBODY!

290
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,284
THEY'RE GOING
TO SINK US!

291
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,161
DON'T YOU HEAR ME?

292
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,413
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR
M INDS ALL OF YOU?

293
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,584
THERE'S A U-BOAT HERE.
I SAW IT. IT'S GOING
TO SINK US.

294
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,129
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO YOU?
DO I HAVE TO GRAB YOU
AND PUT YOU ON DECK?

295
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,631
DO I HAVE TO GRAB YOU
AND PUT YOU IN
THE LIFEBOATS?

296
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,010
DO I HAVE TO KNOCK
YOU UNCONSCIOUS OR--

297
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,328
QUEEN OF GLASGOW.

298

299
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,583

300
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,337
MISS STANLEY!

301
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,757
MAJOR DEVEREAUX!

302
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:25,937
CAPTAIN!

303
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,189
STEWARD!

317
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,590
A GOOD CATCH
TONIGHT, HUH?

318
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,425
THE QUEEN OF GLASGOW.
A 5,000 TONNER.

319
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,761
ISN'T THAT WHAT
THE REGISTRY SAID?

320
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,263
YES, SIR.

321
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,435
OH, YOU HAVE
NERVES, MULLER.

322
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,938
NO, NOT REALLY, SIR.

323
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,690
A LITTLE SHAKY, PERHAPS.

324
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,816
WHY?

325
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,984
NOTHING, SIR.

326
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,945
WHY?

327
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,699
SIR, THERE WERE PEOPLE
ON THAT SHIP. WOMEN, TOO.

328
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,285
SO?

329
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,203
SIR, WE GAVE
THEM NO WARNING.

330
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,372
OH, YOU'D HAVE US
GIVE THEM WARNING, HUH?

331
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,833
SO THEIR RADIO OPERATOR
CAN SIGNAL HIS POSITION

332
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,627
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE,
INCIDENTALLY, OUR POSITION.

333
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,798
YOU HAVE SENTIMENT,
MULLER, BUT NO BRAINS.

334
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,552
YOU'RE AN OLD WOMAN,
YOU KNOW THAT?

335
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,388
I JUST--

336
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,016
I JUST FOUND IT
DIFFICULT TO--

337
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,184
TO DO WHAT?

338
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,522
TO RECONCILE THE KILLING
OF MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT
ANY WARNING.

339
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,695
IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF WE ARE NOT DAMNED NOW.

340
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,822
[chuckIes]

341
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,576
IN THE EYES OF
THE BRIT'SH ADM IRALTY
WE MOST CERTAINLY ARE.

342
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,915
I MEAN, SIR,
IN THE EYES OF GOD.

343
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,251
OH, YOU'RE NOT
ONLY A FOOL, LEUTNANT,

344
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,672
BUT ALSO A RELIGIOUS FOOL,
AND PERHAPS A MYSTIC AT THAT.

345
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,425
SUPPOSE WE ARE DAMNED?
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN?

346
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,180
I'VE HAD DREAMS
ABOUT IT.

347
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:34,060
PERHAPS THERE'S A
SPECIAL KIND OF HELL
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US.

348
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:39,023
PERHAPS TO BE DAMNED
IS TO HAVE A FATE LIKE
THE PEOPLE ON THAT SHIP.

349
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,443
TO SUFFER AS
THEY SUFFERED.

350
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,528
AND TO DIE
AS THEY DIE.

351
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,614
YOU ARE A
MYSTIC, LEUTNANT.

352
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,536
WE RIDE THE GHOST OF
THAT SHIP EVERY NIGHT.

353
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,501
EVERY NIGHT,
HERR KAPITAN,
FOR ETERNITY.

354
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,045
THEY COULD
DIE ONLY ONCE.

355
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,589
JUST ONCE.

356
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:08,886
BUT WE COULD DIE
A HUNDRED M ILLION TIMES.

357
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,056
WE'D RIDE THE GHOST
OF THAT SHIP
EVERY NIGHT.

358
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:18,646
EVERY NIGHT
FOR ETERNITY,
HERR KAPITAN.

359

AWAITING EVERY MAN
