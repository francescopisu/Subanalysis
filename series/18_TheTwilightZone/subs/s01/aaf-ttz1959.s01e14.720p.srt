00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,048
(maIe presenter, off)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,467
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,470
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,306
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,060
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,396
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,649
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,318
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,155
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,742
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,590

YOU BOYS ARE PRETTY
BUSY UP THERE,
AREN'T YOU?

18
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,074
VERY.

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,377
(man)
HOLD THE LIGHT,
WILL YOU, STURKA?

20
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,970
LONG DAYS, HUH?

21
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,722
LONG DAYS.

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,100
YOUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING
FULL BLAST, ISN'T IT?

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,397
IT'S COM ING, BOY,
IT'S REALLY COM ING.
AND A BIG ONE, TOO.

24
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,360
WHILE WE'RE TALKING HERE,
I'LL BET THE M ILITARY
IS GETTING ALL SET.

25
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,864
GOT IT ALL
MAPPED OUT, I BET.

26
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,743
TALK IS 48 HOURS.

27
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,662
YOU WAIT AND SEE
IF I'M NOT RIGHT.

28
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,165
FORTY-EIGHT HOURS,
WE'LL HAVE THEM ALOFT.

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,670
THEN, WHOOSH, UP,
OVER AND WHAMMO.

30
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,672
THERE GOES THE ENEMY.

31
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,757
OBLITERATED, FINISHED.

32
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,884
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
IN THE MEANTIME?

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,888
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
PROBABLY RETALIATING
THE BEST WAY THEY CAN.

34
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,183
[chuckIes]
IT'S A BIG WASTE OF
TIME, LET ME TELL YOU.

35
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,019
WE GET THE FIRST LICKS.
SO THEY CAN'T DO MUCH.

36
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,857
THEY CAN GO WHOOSH,
UP, OVER AND WHAMMO.

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,236
ABSOLUTELY.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,073
BUT NOT SO MANY.
NOT SO PROPERLY AIMED.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,242
NOT SO SKILLFULLY
CARRIED OUT.

40
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,538
SO INSTEAD OF LOSING
50 M ILLION PEOPLE, WE
LOSE ONLY 35, HUH?

41
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,250
YOU A DEFEATIST, STURKA?

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,460
THAT'S DANGEROUS THINKING.

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,629
YOU BETTER M IND
WHAT YOU SAY.

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,549
AND WHAT I
THINK, TOO, HUH?

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,969
YEAH. AND WHAT
YOU THINK.

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,305
GOOD NIGHT, CARLING.

47
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,307
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

QUITTING TIME AT THE PLANT.

TIME FOR SUPPER NOW.
TIME FOR FAMILIES

50
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,653
TIME FOR A COOL
DRINK ON A PORCH.

51
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,489
TIME FOR THE QUIET RUSTLE
OF LEAF-LADEN TREES

52
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,950
THAT SCREEN OUT THE MOON.

53
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,579

BEHIND THE EYES OF THE MEN

00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,665
HANGING INVISIBLE
OVER THE SUMMER NIGHT

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,752
IS A HORROR
WITHOUT WORDS.

56
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,255
FOR THIS IS
THE STILLNESS
BEFORE A STORM.

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,258
THIS IS THE EVE
OF THE END.

[slow music playing]

59
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,500
HELLO, DAD.

60
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,503
HELLO, BABY.
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

61
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,882
SHE'S OUT IN THE BACK TRYING
TO URGE THE RADISHES OUT OF
THE GROUND OR SOMETHING.

62
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,469
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
NOT BEFORE WE
HAVE OUR DANCE.

63
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,973
SOME OTHER TIME, HONEY.

DAD?

67
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,152
WHAT, JODY?

68
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,530
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

69
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,991
NOTHING SERIOUS.

70
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,327
JUST FEELING
MY YEARS, I GUESS.

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,540
YOU, MY DARLING,
YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE
AND YOUR MATURING WAYS,

72
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,668
YOU SUDDENLY REM IND
ME THAT MY YOUTH IS
UPSTAIRS IN THE ATTIC

73
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,586
SPREAD OUT OVER
A FEW PHOTO ALBUMS.

74
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,505
IS THAT ALL?

75
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,549
IS THAT ALL?
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

76
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,177
DAD?

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,596
DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?

78
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,223
THE JOB.

79
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,854
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A JOB.

80
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,275
OH, I MEAN JUST HAVING
TO WORK ON THE KIND OF
THINGS THAT YOU DO.

81
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,279
FEVER BOMBS AND HYDROGEN
BOMBS AND GAS AND THINGS
LIKE THAT.

82
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,198
NO, I'M JUST A COG
IN A WHEEL, JODY.

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,536
I MEAN, LOOK
AT IT THIS WAY.

84
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,039
IN ONE BOMB THERE ARE
PERHAPS A THOUSAND PIECES,

85
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,751
AND EVERY PIECE
REQUIRES A TEAM
OF 50, 60, 70 PEOPLE.

86
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,920
LOOKING AT IT LIKE
THAT, I'M NOT--

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,423
QUITE AS
RESPONSIBLE AS IF I--

88
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,467
HELLO, DARLING.

89
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,928
EVERYONE I'VE
TALKED TO LATELY
THEY'VE BEEN NOTICING IT.

90
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,972
NOTICING WHAT, JO?

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,475
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG.

92
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,226
THAT SOMETHING'S--

93
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,396
SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR.

94
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,649
THAT SOMETHING'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

95
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,612
AND EVERYBODY'S AFRAID.

96
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,405
EVERYONE, DAD, WHY?

97
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,079
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
BECAUSE THEY MAKE
THEMSELVES AFRAID.

98
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,957
THEY'RE AFRAID BECAUSE
THEY SUBVERT EVERY GREAT
THING EVER DISCOVERED.

99
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,795
EVERY FINE IDEA EVER
THOUGHT, EVERY MARVELOUS
INVENTION EVER CONCEIVED.

100
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,755
THEY SUBVERT IT, JODY.

101
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,341
THEY MAKE IT
CROOKED AND DEVIOUS.

102
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,218
AND THEN TOO LATE,

103
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,138
FAR TOO LATE THEY
ASK THEMSELVES THE
QUESTION WHY.

104
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,393
AND THEN IT'S TOO LATE.
EVERYTHING IS TOO LATE!

105
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,815
INVITE JERRY RIDEN
AND HIS WIFE OVER
TONIGHT, WILL YOU, EVE?

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,650
WE'LL HAVE SOME
CARDS OR SOMETHING.

107
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,944
ISN'T JERRY OUT OF TOWN?

108
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,363
ISN'T HE TESTING SOME
SORT OF AIRCRAFT UP NORTH?

109
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,283
NO, HE'S BACK.
HE CAME BACK THIS MORNING.

110
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,828
I TOLD HIM
WE'D PHONE THEM.

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,497
YOU'LL BE THERE,
JODY, WON'T YOU?

112
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,040
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.

113
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,043
OH, I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T.

114
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,505
I'VE, UH, I'VE GOT A DATE.
MAYBE I COULD GET IN
A LITTLE EARLY.

115
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,173
BREAK IT,
WILL YOU, JODY?

116
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,883
I'D LIKE YOU
HOME TONIGHT.

117
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,094
BUT DAD, I CAN'T--

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,472
OH, ALL RIGHT, DAD.

119
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,516
JERRY HAS SOME VERY
INTERESTING STORIES.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,644
HE HAS A FASCINA TING
JOB. HE FLIES THOSE--

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,317
BILL?

122
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,070
I THOUGHT YOU'D M IGHT
LIKE TO HAVE SOME
CARDS TONIGHT.

123
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,656
I THOUGHT IT M IGHT TAKE
YOUR M IND OFF THINGS.

124
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,014
BILL?

125
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,851
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

126
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,021
WHAT DO YOU FEEL
IS HAPPENING?

127
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,107
I HAVE SO MUCH
FEAR INSIDE ME I--

128
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,151
I CAN'T GIVE IT WORDS.

129
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:14,034
EVE, IT'S TOO LATE FOR
SUBTERFUGE NOW. IT'S
TOO LATE FOR ANYTHING.

130
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,787
IT'S COM ING. IT'S COM ING
PROBABLY WITHIN 48 HOURS.

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,081
WILL IT BE BAD?

132
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,877
IT'LL BE A HOLOCAUST.
IT WILL BE HELL. IT'LL
BE THE END OF EVERYTHING.

133
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,215
PEOPLE, PLACES, IDEAS,
EVERYTHING. IT WILL ALL
BE WIPED OUT.

134
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,716
IN 48 HOURS?

135
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,718
MAYBE SOONER.

136
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,887
WHAT CAN WE DO?

137
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,015
SIT DOWN ON THE BED
A MOMENT, EVE. I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

138
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,311
WE'RE LEAVING.

139
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,480
YOU AND JODY AND I
AND JERRY AND ANN.

140
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,232
WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT.

141
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,609
LEAVING?
LEAVING FOR WHERE?

142
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,279
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT
BETWEEN M IDNIGHT AND 1 :00

143
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,950
WE'VE GOT TO BE OUT
OF HERE AND GONE, AND
NO ONE IS TO KNOW.

144
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,620
I MEAN NO ONE,
NOT NEIGHBORS, NOT
RELATIVES, NOT EVEN JODY.

145
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,331
SHE'S NOT TO KNOW,
AND WE WON'T BE
ABLE TO TELL HER

146
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,625
UNTIL WE'RE
ALREADY ON OUR WAY.

147
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,170
DAD? JERRY RIDEN
IS DOWN HERE. HE'D
LOVE TO TALK TO YOU.

148
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,172
I'M COMING DOWN, JODY.

149
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,757
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
WHY IS HE HERE?

150
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,301
THAT'S WHAT I
WANT TO FIND OUT.

151
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,347
YOU BETTER TELL SOME FUNNY
STORIES TONIGHT, JERRY. I
HAD TO BREAK A DATE FOR YOU.

152
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,599
HI, BILL.

153
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,103
YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME
THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT FOR CARDS.

154
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,313
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S HIGH STAKES TONIGHT

155
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,692
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN VERY
HOT AT CARDS THE LAST
COUPLE OF WEEKS.

156
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,279
I JUST DROPPED
BY TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT, UH--

157
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,322
YOUR WATCH'S GIVING
YOU TROUBLE AGAIN?

158
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,491
UH, YEAH.

159
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,036
PROBABLY THAT MAINSPRING.
IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD
SOME RUST ON IT.

160
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,581
HERE, LET ME SEE IT.

161
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,127
NOW, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.

162
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,962
BILL, WE'VE GOT
TO CHANGE OUR PLAN.

163
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,673
NOT YET, NOT YET.
WAIT A M INUTE.

164
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,429
[electric engine whirring]

165
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,816
NOW, THERE'S YOUR
TROUBLE, JERRY,
RIGHT THERE.

166
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,985
TELL ME,
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

167
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,238
THEY'VE PUT A DIFFERENT
GUARD ON THE SHIP, ON
THE 1 :00 A.M. SHIFT.

168
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,325
THE ONE I KNOW,
THE ONE I'VE PAID
GETS OFF AT 1 1 :00.

169
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,704
THEN WE HAVE TO
LEAVE BEFORE 1 1 :00.

170
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,665
THAT WILL BE A LOT
TOUGHER. THERE ARE MORE
MEN ON THE FIELD THEN.

171
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,086
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
WE'RE ONLY YOUR RELATIVES WITH
PERMISSION TO LOOK AT THE SHIP.

172
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,213
THAT'S WHAT OUR
CREDENTIALS WILL SHOW.

173
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,424
JUST THE SAME. THE FEWER
WHO KNOW, THE BETTER.

174
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,635
DOES ANN KNOW, YET?

175
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,971
NOT EVERYTHING. ONLY THAT
WE'RE IN DANGER AND WE'VE
GOT TO GET OUT.

176
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,849
I DIDN'T TELL HER
WHERE OR WHEN. WHAT
ABOUT EVE AND JODY?

177
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,102
EVE KNOWS NOW.
JODY WILL STAY
HOME TONIGHT.

178
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,689
I TOLD HER YOU WERE
COMING OVER. YOU AND
ANN TO PLAY CARDS.

179
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,192
YOU CAN COME AROUND
7:00, CAN'T YOU?

180
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,735
YEAH.

181
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,952
I THINK THAT THAT DOES
IT, JERRY. JUST A LITTLE
MAINSPRING PROBLEM.

182
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,039
YOU M IGHT WANNA HAVE IT
CHECKED BY A JEWELER IN
A MONTH OR SO.

183
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,874
I COULDN'T GET ALL
THE RUST OUT OF IT.

184
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,918
THANKS, BILL, VERY MUCH.

185
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,408
SIXTEEN.

186
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,247
FOUR.

187
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,211
TWELVE.

188
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,176
EIGHT.

189
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,933
SEVEN.

190
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,227
YOU ARE LUCKY TONIGHT.

191
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,277
HOW ABOUT SOME LEMONADE
AND HOMEMADE CAKE,
EVERYONE?

192
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,695
SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

193
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,946
WELL, I'LL GET A TRAY.

194
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,448
I'LL HELP YOU WITH IT.

195
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,658
COME ALONG, YOUNG
WOMAN, LEND A HAND.

196
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,460
I KNOW OUR DESTINATION
NOW. RIGHT THERE.

197
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,003
HOW FAR?

198
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,799
ELEVEN M ILLION M ILES.

199
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,970
IN A SHIP WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WILL LEAVE
THE ATMOSPHERE.

200
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,975
OR WHETHER OR NOT ITS PILOT
CAN EITHER TAKE OFF OR GET
YOU DOWN IN ONE PIECE.

201
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,021
THAT'S THE RISK, BILL.
THAT'S THE RISK WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS NOW.

202
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,400
IT'S A GOOD RISK
WHEN YOU CONSIDER
THE ALTERNATIVES.

203
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,402
NOW, THIS PLACE
WE'RE GOING TO.

204
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,239
IT'S POPULATED, BILL.
IT HAS PEOPLE ON IT.

205
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,366
WE'VE PICKED
UP RADIO WAVES.

206
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,870
EVEN SOME SNATCHES
OF A LANGUAGE NOT
DISSIM ILAR TO OURS.

207
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,872
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
DECIPHER A LOT OF IT.

208
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,665
[doorbell rings]

209
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,044
WITH A LITTLE HELP,
A COUPLE OF BREAKS,

210
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,338
AND GOD, WE M IGHT
EVEN MAKE IT THERE.

211
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,840
(Eve)
BILL, MR. CARLING IS HERE.

212
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,182
WELL, STURKA, A LITTLE
CARDS TONIGHT, EH?

213
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,184
A LITTLE CARDS, CARLING.

214
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,728
WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO CUT INTO A CAKE.
YOU CARE TO JOIN US?

215
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,189
THANK YOU.
JUST A LITTLE
LEMONADE FOR ME.

216
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,609
I WAS JUST TELLING YOUR
WIFE THAT SHE MAKES
WONDERFUL LEMONADE.

217
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,072
HOT NIGHT, TOO, HUH?

218
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,952
THIS IS A NIGHT
FOR A FRONT PORCH,

219
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,955
OR SLEEP. BUT
NOTHING ELSE.

220
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,207
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

221
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,960
WE'LL BE LEAVING IN
A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

222
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,088
I'VE BEEN UP NORTH
TESTING AN AIRCRAFT.

223
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,590
HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SLEEP
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

224
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,635
YES, I KNOW
THE AIRCRAFT.

225
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,472
THEY SAY IT'S CAPABLE
OF LEAVING OUR ATMOSPHERE.

226
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,058
TALK IS IT COULD GO
TO ANOTHER PLANET

227
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,935
IF THE RIGHT
MAN FLEW HER.

228
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,397
WELL, NOT FOR
AWHILE, YET.

229
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,983
IT NEEDS A LOT
MORE TESTING.

230
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,901
OH.

231
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,117
MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE?

232
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,997
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,
MR. STURKA, YOU OWE ANN
AND ME A LITTLE MONEY HERE.

233
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,670
MARVELOUS SCIENTIST.
VERY BAD CARD PLAYER.

234
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,839
I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT.

235
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,676
I WOULD'VE GUESSED
THAT STURKA HERE WAS
A GOOD GAMBLER.

236
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,845
I'D GUESS HE'D GAMBLE
ON MOST ANYTHING.

237
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,597
(Eve)
HERE WE ARE.

238
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,599
LEMONADE, EVERYONE?

239
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,517
I'LL CUT
THE CAKE, EVE.

240
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,024
HEY, YOU'RE A LITTLE
NERVOUS, MRS. STURKA.

241
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,234
YOU'RE VERY NERVOUS.

242
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,267
YOU'VE LOST QUITE
A BIT ACCORDING
TO THIS, STURKA.

243
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,812
WE WON'T SETTLE
TONIGHT, UH--

244
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,651
NEXT WEEK, NEXT WEEK
WE'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

245
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,569
NEXT WEEK?

246
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,529
YOU DO PLAN AHEAD.

247
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,365
YOU PLAN WAY AHEAD.

248
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,410
A WEEK?

249
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,874
A LOT CAN
HAPPEN IN A WEEK.

250
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,377
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN 48 HOURS.

251
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,006
WELL, I'LL GET
ON HOME NOW.

252
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,842
I LIKE TO TAKE A
WALK ON WARM EVENINGS.

253
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,888
IT MAKES ME
SLEEP BETTER.

254
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,848
I'LL SEE YOU
TO THE DOOR,
MR. CARLING.

255
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,600
THANK YOU.

256
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,527
I'LL PROBABLY SEE YOU
AT THE OFFICE TOMORROW.

257
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,487
YES, OF COURSE.

258
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,366
PRETTY NIGHT.

259
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,453
CLEAR AS A BELL.
NOTHING BUT STARS.

260
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,124
YOU EVER THINK,
STURKA, THAT

261
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,962
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE
ON THOSE STARS, TOO?

262
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,214
MAYBE PEOPLE
JUST LIKE US.

263
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,219
THAT THOUGHT HAS
CROSSED MY M IND.

264
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:58,057
EVER THINK MAYBE YOU'D BE
HAPPIER ON ONE OF THOSE
THAN YOU ARE HERE?

265
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,562
THAT THOUGHT HAS
CROSSED MY M IND, TOO.

266
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,313
YEAH.

267
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,569
YEAH, I HAVE NO DOUBT.

268
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,836
THE TIME IS NOW. JODY, I'VE
GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT.

269
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,923
THERE'S A SHIP AT THE
GOVERNMENT FIELD. WE'RE ALL
GONNA DRIVE OVER THERE NOW.

270
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,011
WE'VE BRIBED A LOT OF
PEOPLE AND THE SHIP'S
LOADED WITH SUPPLIES.

271
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,180
YOU'VE BEEN
PLANNINGTHIS!

272
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,349
FOR THREE MONTHS NOW.
BUT TONIGHT HAS
TO BE IT, JODY.

273
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,603
TONIGHT'S THE LAST CHANCE.
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE
HERE TONIGHT.

274
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,688
WHY TONIGHT, JERRY?

275
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,816
BECAUSE THIS WORLD
AS WE KNOW IT WON'T
EXIST MUCH LONGER.

276
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,111
IT'S ABOUT TO BLOW
ITSELF UP AND THAT
MAY HAPPEN BY MORNING.

277
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,114
WELL, IN THE MORNING
WHERE WILL WE BE?

278
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,330
WE'LL BE OUT IN
SPACE, JODY. FAR OUT.

279
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,457
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
READY, EVERYBODY.

280
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,335
I'LL BACK THE CAR OUT
OF THE GARAGE. ANN, IS
YOUR BAG READY?

281
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,462
IT'S IN OUR BEDROOM.
I'LL GO GET IT.

282
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,007

283
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,176

[ringing]

285
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,807
I'VE GOT TO ANSWER IT.

287
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,651
YES?

288
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,573
TONIGHT?

289
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,576
WELL, I, UH,
I'M IN BED.

290
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,917
[caller hangs up]

291
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,508
THAT WAS MY DIVISION HEAD.
THEY'RE WORKING TONIGHT.

292
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,426
THEY'RE SENDING
A CAR OVER FOR ME.

293
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,846
THEN WE BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

294
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,139
I'LL GET
OUR BAGS.

295
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,688
THIS IS SILLY,
ISN'T IT?

296
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,357
WE AREN'T EVER COM ING
BACK HERE AGAIN.

297
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,976
THAT'S IT.
THERE IT IS.

298
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,815
MOTHER, IT'S GOING TO
BE ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

299
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,572
IS THAT OUR CONTACT?

300
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,741
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

301
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,827
EVE, FLASH THE
LIGHTS, JUST ONCE.

302
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:38,402
GOOD EVENING, STURKA.
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM
HOME, AREN'T YOU?

303
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,458
NOW, YOU TWO STAND
THERE VERY QUIETLY

304
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,545
AND BREATHE
THROUGH YOUR NOSE

305
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,005
VERY, VERY QUIETLY.

306
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,154
GET BACK IN
THE CAR, PLEASE.

307
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,956
WOULD YOU TWO GET IN
THE FRONT SEAT, PLEASE?

308
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,338
WOULD YOU

M IND GETTING OUT?

00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,425
THESE TWO
GENTLEMEN AND
I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT

00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,760

00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,670

320
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,264
THE STARS
LOOK FAR AWAY.

321
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,183
THEY ARE FAR AWAY.

322
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:18,437
BUT THE ONE WE WANT,
THAT'S NOT SO FAR, BILL.

323
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,856
SEE IT THERE?

324
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,608
IT'S THE SHINY ONE.

325
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,318
THE BRIGHT ONE
OVER ON THE RIGHT.

326
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,783
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE.
PEOPLE LIKE US.

327
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,537
PEOPLE LIKE US.

328
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,039
IT'S THE THIRD PLANET
FROM THE SUN, BILL.

329
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,291
IT'S CALLED

330
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,044
EARTH.

331
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,963
THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GOING.

332
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,133

CALLED EARTH.
