THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:16,390
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS FAST AS SPACE
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,060
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,396
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,357
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS,

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,860
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:31,238
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:35,242

WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

WHO'S BEGUN HIS DYING EARLY.

THROUGH A MAZE OF BOTTLES.

AN ARM OR A LEG
OR A PART OF HIS SOUL

37
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,123
TO HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE.
TO BE ABLE TO RISE UP

38
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,250
AND SHAKE THE DIRT
FROM HIS BODY

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:35,339

THAT INFEST HIS
CONSCIOUSNESS.

RIDE INTO TOWN

153
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,175
TO MAKE ME PROVE IT.

154
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,927
AND EVERY MORNING

155

TO PROVE IT

163
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,496

ALL OVER AGAIN NOW.

WILL COME RIDING IN
DOWN THAT STREET.

166
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,630
ONLY THIS TIME,
IT'LL BE ME FACE DOWN

167

169
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,977
I WANT TO LOOK PROPER
ON THE DAY I DIE.

170
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,567
A TALL MAN.

WEAR HIS GUN.

00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,615
WHO DOES
THAT DESCRIBE?

173
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,159
IT DESCRIBES A MAN
NAMED AL DENTON.

174
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,080
HE SUPPOSED

I GOT A MESSAGE

[suspense music]

182
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,557
YOU TELL HIM,

183
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,892
YOU TELL HIM
THERE'S NO CALL.

184
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,403
TELL MR. GRANT I'LL
BE THERE TOMORROW NIGHT.

185
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,655
I'LL WAIT
FOR HIS PLEASURE.

186
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,284
IT'S JUST WHAT IT'LL BE.

187
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,675
[horses riding away]

188
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,938
IT DIDN'T TAKE
ANY TIME AT ALL.

189
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,900
JUST TIME ENOUGH
FOR ONE SHAVE.

190
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,391
[metallic rattling]

191
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,271
EVENING, MR. DENTON.

192
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,274
I CAN'T USE ANYTHING.

193
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,943
HOW'S THAT?

194
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,319
I CAN'T USE ANYTHING.

195
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,071
YOU'RE A PEDDLER,
AREN'T YOU?

196
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,616
OH, YES.
DEALER IN EVERYTHING.

MEDICINE, LINIMENTS
AND TONICS.

199
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,335
AND POTIONS.

200
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,132
OH, YES. POTIONS.

201
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,884
KIND OF A SIDELINE,
YOU M IGHT SAY.

202
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,179
FATE'S THE NAME.
HENRY J. FATE.

203
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,098
AND YOU'RE AL DENTON.

204
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,308
AND YOU'RE
RUNNING AWAY.

205
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,893
YOU SHOULDN'T,
YOU KNOW.

206
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,687
YOU SHOULDN'T
RUN AWAY.

207
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,230
I SHOULDN'T.

208
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,025
YEAH. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

209
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,693
I SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY.

210
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,946
I SHOULD STAY HERE
AND GET SHOT TO DEATH.

211
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,365
I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

212
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,867
CURSE THIS THING.

213
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,244
CURSE THE MOMENT I FOUND IT.

214
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,871
(Henry)
NO, NO, NO.

215
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,873
DON'T CURSE IT,
MR. DENTON.

216
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,583
USE IT.

217
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,752
HERE.

218
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,421
THIS IS ONE OF MY POTIONS.

219
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,382
YOU M IGHT CALL IT THAT,
OR AN ELIXIR.

220
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,426
EITHER WAY, IT'LL HELP SOLVE

221
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,553
YOUR PROBLEM,
MR. DENTON.

222
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,273
I CALL THAT
MY FAST GUN DEVELOPER.

223
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,401
MAN WHO DRINKS THAT
BECOMES THE FASTEST
OF THE FAST.

224
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,278
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SHOOT A HOLE

225
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,447
THROUGH A SILVER DOLLAR
IN MID-AIR

226
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,533
AT A HUNDRED FEET OR BETTER
WITHOUT EVEN AIMING.

227
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,203
IT'S GUARANTEED
TO LAST FOR TEN SECONDS.

228
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,330
TEN SECONDS?

229
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,791
AND AFTER THAT?

230
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,336
WELL, AFTER THAT,
THE USER'S ON HIS OWN.

231
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,546
HERE. TRY IT.

232
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,966
WELL, TEST
THE MERCHANDISE,
SO TO SPEAK.

233
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,094
GO AHEAD.

234
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,595
PROOF OF THE PUDDING.

235
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,347
GO AHEAD.

236
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,890
DRINK IT.

237
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,862
THERE'S YOUR TARGET,
MR. DENTON.

238
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,448
GO AHEAD. DRAW ON IT.

239
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,825
DRAW ON IT!

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,171
THERE YOU GO,
MR. DENTON.

243
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,049
NOW THAT GUN
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ANY MORE USE TO YOU

244
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,761
THAN A BOTTLE
WOULD BE TO A BULL. HERE.

245
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,931
DRINK THIS
TWO SECONDS AFTER
1 0:00 IN THE NIGHT.

246
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,851
JUST AT THE MOMENT
MR. GRANT WALKS
INTO THE SALOON.

247
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,190
HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

248
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,526
OH, THERE'S NO CHARGE
FOR THIS.

249
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,320
YOU M IGHT CALL THIS--
JUST A SERVICE.

250
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,822
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

251
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,408
JUST A SERVICE
OF HENRY J. FATE

252
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,202
JUST SO YOU M IGHT
REMEMBER SOMETIME

253
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,080
THE NIGHT FATE STEPPED IN.

254
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,424
[ticking]

255
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,152
YOU WANT
A DRINK, AL?

256
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,032
HOW ABOUT YOU, DOC?

257
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,786
[suspense music]

258
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,505
THAT WOULD BE GRANT.

259
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,616
[suspense music]

260
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,887
YOU DENTON?

261
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,430
THAT'S RIGHT.

262
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,183
I HEAR YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE FAST.

263
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,647
YOU GOT A GOOD CHANCE
TO FIND OUT.

264
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,941
I AIM TO.

265
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,819
(Grant)
STEP AWAY
FROM THE BAR,
PLEASE, MR. DENTON.

266
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,740
AND DRAW.

267
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,543
THIS IS
A PUSH, BOYS.

268
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,711
NO WINNER.

269
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,259
YEAH, YOU WON'T
BE SHOOTING ANYMORE
WITH THAT HAND, AL.

270
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,303
NOT ANYMORE.

271
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,805
COUPLE OF FINGERS
ARE GOING TO BE
STIFF, TOO.

272
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,350
BUT THAT DON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

273
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,810
THE WAY YOU
STOOD UP THERE,

274
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,980
THAT WILL BE
SOMETHING TO TELL
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT.

275
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:42,193
AND THE WAY IT LOOKS
NOW, YOU'LL LIVE
TO HAVE SOME.

276
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,369
JUST LIKE ME.

277
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,745
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE

278
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,997
TO FIRE A GUN
AGAIN IN ANGER.

279
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,041
YOU'RE BLESSED, SON.

280
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,544
WE'VE BOTH
BEEN BLESSED.

281
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,803
HE'S LUCKY.

282
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,137
HE LEARNED
IT EARLY.

283
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,477
DID YOU
GET HIM, PETE?

284
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,814
NO MORE
THAN HE GOT ME.

285
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,137

00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,550
GIRLS, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE USED THOSE
PAPER NAPKINS

314
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,302
THEY ALWAYS SLIDE
OFF YOUR LAP.

315
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,054
PARDON THIS
INTRUSION, LADIES.

316
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,307
