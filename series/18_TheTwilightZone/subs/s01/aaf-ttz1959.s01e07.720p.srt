[eerie music]

00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,423
(male presenter, off)
THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,217
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN
TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,053
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,223
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:20,060
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,312
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,068
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,071
THIS IS
THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,616
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,090
WITNESS, IF YOU
WILL, A DUNGEON

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,011
MADE OUT OF MOUNTAINS,
SALT FLATS AND SAND

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,472
THAT STRETCH TO INFINITY.

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,433
THE DUNGEON HAS AN INMATE--

16
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:04,021
[honking horn]

17
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,981
JAMES A. CORRY--

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,441
AND THIS IS
HIS RESIDENCE:

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,735
METAL SHACK.

20
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,530
AN OLD TOURING CAR
THAT SQUATS IN THE
SUN AND GOES NOWHERE,

21
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,367
FOR THERE IS
NOWHERE TO GO.

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,203
FOR THE RECORD,
LET IT BE KNOWN

23
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,872
THAT JAMES A. CORRY
IS A CONVICTED CRIM INAL

24
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,042
PLACED IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

25
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,752
CONFINEMENT, IN THIS CASE,

26
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,130
STRETCHES AS FAR
AS THE EYE CAN SEE

27
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,716
BECAUSE THIS
PARTICULAR DUNGEON
IS ON AN ASTEROID

28
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,802
NINE M ILLION M ILES
FROM THE EARTH.

29
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,265
NOW WITNESS, IF YOU WILL

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,686
A MAN'S M IND AND BODY
SHRIVELING IN THE SUN--

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,022
A MAN DYING
OF LONELINESS.

32
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:05,415
(Corry, off)
ENTRY, 1 5TH DAY,
SIXTH MONTH, YEAR FOUR.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,170
AND ALL THE
DAYS AND THE MONTHS
AND THE YEARS ARE THE SAME.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,382
THERE'LL BE A SUPPLY SHIP
COMING IN SOON, I THINK.

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,592
THEY'RE EITHER
DUE OR OVERDUE.

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,803
AND I HOPE IT'S
ALLENBY'S SHIP

37
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,098
BECAUSE HE'S A DECENT MAN
AND HE BRINGS THINGS
FOR ME.

38
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,560
LIKE HE BROUGHT IN
THE PARTS FOR THAT
ANTIQUE AUTOMOBILE.

39
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,687
I WAS A YEAR
PUTTING THAT
THING TOGETHER,

40
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,647
SUCH AS IT IS.

41
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,276
A WHOLE YEAR
PUTTING AN
OLD CAR TOGETHER.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,946
BUT THANK GOD FOR
THAT CAR, AND FOR
THE HOURS I USED UP,

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,448
AND THE DAYS
AND THE WEEKS.

44
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,119
I CAN LOOK AT IT
OUT THERE, AND I
KNOW THAT IT'S REAL.

45
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,621
REALITY IS WHAT I NEED.

46
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,251
BECAUSE WHAT IS THERE
LEFT THAT I CAN
BELIEVE IN?

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,378
THE DESERT AND THE WIND?

48
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,463
THE SILENCE?

49
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,132
OR MYSELF?

50
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,051
CAN I BELIEVE IN
MYSELF ANYMORE?

51
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,882
ALLEN BY?

52
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,678
ALLEN BY!

53
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,388
ALLENBY!

54
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,141
ALLEN BY!

55
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,935
HOW ARE
YOU, CORRY?

56
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,229
ALL RIGHT. YOU?

57
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,563
QU ITE A PLACE
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,315
G LAD YOU
LIKE IT.

59
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,108
I DIDN'T SAY
I LIKED IT. I
THINK IT STIN KS.

60
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,110
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIVE HERE.

61
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,738
NO, BUT I HAVE
TO COME BACK HERE
FOUR TIMES A YEAR.

62
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,282
THAT'S EIGHT MONTHS
AWAY FROM EARTH.

63
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,369
SOMETIMES MY
KIDS DON'T EVEN
RECOG N IZE ME.

64
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,205
BUT YOU, YOU'VE
GOT IT MADE HERE.

65
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,375
YEAH, THIS MAKES
FOR S IMPLE LIVING,
DOESN'T IT?

66
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,211
6,000 M I LES
FROM NORTH
TO SOUTH,

67
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,630
4,000 FROM
EAST TO WEST,

68
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,216
AND ALL OF IT
JUST LIKE THIS.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,886
(Allenby)
ALL RIGHT, ADAMS,
CUT IT OUT.

70
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,722
NOW, WE'VE ONLY GOT
A 1 5-MINUTE LAYOVER.

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,725
NO ON E'S CHECKING
ON YOUR SCH EDU LE
WAY OUT HERE.

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,811
WE CAN PLAY A
COUPLE OF GAM ES
OF CARDS.

73
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,314
IF WE DELAY OU R
TIME OF DEPARTU RE,

74
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,484
IT JUST PLACES
US IN A DIFFERENT
ORB ITAL POS ITION.

75
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,569
WE'LL NEVER MAKE
IT BACK TO EARTH.

76
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,072
WE WOULD
HAVE TO STAY
HERE AT LEAST

77
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,075
1 4 DAYS BEFORE IT'S
IN POS ITION AGAIN.

78
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,494
OH, 1 4 DAYS!
I GOT SOME
BEER SAVED.

79
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,538
WE COULD PLAY
SOME CARDS.

80
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,040
I WISH WE COULD
BUT, LIKE I SAID,

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,375
WE'VE ONLY
GOT 1 5 MINUTES.

82
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,210
WHAT'S A
FEW MINUTES?

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,170
HEY, WE COULD
PLAY CH ESS.

84
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,339
I BU I LT
A CH ESS SET
AND EVERYTHING.

85
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,424
LET'S GO IN.

86
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,556
ALLEN BY, ONLY
TWO MINUTES
ARE GON E.

87
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,683
TWO MINUTES HAVE
PASSED ALREADY.

88
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,351
WE'VE ONLY
GOT 1 3 LEFT.

89
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,978
I DON'T WANT
TO FOU L UP
YOUR SCH EDU LE,

90
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,354
BUT HOW ABOUT
ONE GAME OF CARDS?

91
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,523
WE JUST DON'T
HAVE THE TIME.

92
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,150
WE'VE BEEN HERE
TWO MINUTES ALREADY,

93
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,068
AND H E
HASN'T ASKED
ABOUT THE PARDON.

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,409
HOW ABOUT
IT, ALLEN BY?

95
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,953
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK,
THE SENTENCE READS
50 YEARS.

96
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,748
AND THEY'RE NOT
EVEN REVI EWING
CASES OF HOM ICI DE.

97
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,291
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOUR YEARS NOW,

98
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,543
SO THAT MAKES
46 MORE TO GO,

99
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,671
SO MAKE YOURSELF
COM FORTABLE, HUH?

100
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,590
CORRY, WE DON'T
MAKE THE RU LES.

101
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,052
WE DELIVER SU PPLI ES
AND PASS ON IN FORMATION.

102
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,889
THERE'S BEEN PRESSURE
BACK HOME ABOUT THIS
KIND OF PU N ISH MENT.

103
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,434
A LOT PEOPLE
THINK IT'S
U N N ECESSARI LY CRU EL.

104
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,978
THEY MAY
CHANG E THEIR MINDS
AND ALTER THE LAW,

105
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,315
AND IMPRISON
YOU ON EARTH
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

106
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,068
BUT--

107
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,488
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
MAY BRING?

108
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,572
YEARS?

109
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,076
EVERY MORNING,
WHEN I GET UP,

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,330
I TELL MYSELF THIS IS
MY LAST DAY OF SAN ITY.

111
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,833
I CAN'T STAND
THIS LON ELIN ESS
ONE MORE DAY.

112
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,253
NOT ONE MORE DAY!

113
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,464
BY NOON, WHEN I CAN'T
KEEP MY FING ERS STILL,

114
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,676
AND THE I NSIDE OF MY MOUTH
FEELS LIKE GU N POWDER
AND BU RNT COPPER,

115
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,553
DOWN DEEP
INSIDE MY GUT

116
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,182
I GET AN ACHE THAT'S
JUST PULLING EVERYTHING OUT.

117
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,768
THEN I FORCE MYSELF
TO HOLD ON FOR ONE
MORE DAY.

118
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,146
JUST ONE MORE DAY!

119
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,941
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT
FOR ANOTHER 46 YEARS.

120
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,526
I'LL GO RIGHT
OUT OF MY MIND.

121
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,028
YOU'RE BREAKING
MY HEART.

122
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,782
ADAMS, YOU AND
CARSTAIRS GO GET
THE SU PPLI ES.

123
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,951
MR. CORRY GOT
A BROKEN LEG?

124
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,829
YOU GO
DO WHAT
I TELL YOU.

125
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,913
(Allenby)
NOW.

126
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,709
THAT BIG CRATE?
YOU KNOW, THE
BIG ONE?

127
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,129
YOU TREAT
THAT ONE GENTLY.

128
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,597
BROUGHT YOU
SOME PAPERBACK BOOKS.

129
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,391
THANKS.

130
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,061
CORRY, I BROUGHT
YOU SOMETHING
ELSE TOO.

131
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,232
IT'D MEAN MY JOB
IF THEY EVER SUSPECT.

132
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,361
IT'D BE MY N ECK I F
THEY FOU N D OUT
FOR SURE.

133
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,487
LOOK, ALLEN BY.

134
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,829
I DON'T
WANT ANY GI FTS.

135
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,747
I DON'T
WANT TI DB ITS.

136
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,708
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
AN AN I MAL IN A CAG E,

137
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,251
WITH AN OLD
LADY OUT THERE

138
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,670
WHO WANTS
TO THROW
PEAN UTS AT ME.

139
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,672
A PARDON, ALLEN BY.

140
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,425
THAT'S THE ONLY
G I FT I WANT.

141
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,260
I'M NOT A M U RDERER.

142
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,262
I KI LLED
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

143
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,264
THERE'S STILL A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO
BELIEVE ME.

144
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,766
IT HAPPENS TO
BE THE TRUTH! I
KI LLED IN SELF-DEFENSE!

145
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,686
I KNOW. I
KNOW ALL
ABOUT IT.

146
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,067
AND I DOU BT I F
THIS WILL BE ANY
CONSOLATION TO YOU, BUT--

147
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,403
THIS ISN'T AN
EASY ASSIGN MENT
TO HAN DLE--

148
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,071
STOPPING HERE
FOUR TIMES A YEAR

149
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,617
AND HAVING TO LOOK
AT A MAN'S AGONY.

150
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,036
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALLEN BY.

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,954
THAT'S VERY
LITTLE CONSOLATION.

152
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,539
I CAN'T BRING
YOU FREEDOM.

153
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,957
ALL I CAN DO IS TRY
TO BRING YOU THINGS

154
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,959
TO H ELP KEEP
YOUR SAN ITY.

155
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,588
SOMETHING TO--ANYTHING
SO YOU CAN J UST
FIGHT LON ELIN ESS.

156
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,634
(Adams)
HEY, CAPTAIN!

157
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,220
YOU WANNA OPEN UP
THIS BIG CRATE?

158
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,763
NO. NOT YET.

159
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,890
U H, STAY OUT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

160
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,353
WE GOT TO GO NOW.

161
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,565
WE'LL BE BACK
IN THREE MONTHS.

162
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,069
LOOK, WH EN
YOU OPEN UP
THAT CRATE

163
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,737
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU NEED TO DO.

164
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,240
THE ITEM'S
BEEN VACU U M-PACKED.

165
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,325
YOU'LL NEED
NO ACTIVATOR
OF ANY KIND.

166
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,118
THE AIR
WILL DO THAT.

167
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,745
THERE WILL BE

WHAT HAS BEEN THE SUM TOTAL

264
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,065
OF THIS VERY STRANGE
AND BIZARRE RELATIONSHIP.

265
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,234
IS IT MAN AND WOMAN?

266
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,611
OR MAN AND MACHINE?

267
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,030
I DON'T REALLY KNOW MYSELF.

268
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,824
BUT THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I DO KNOW

269
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,618
THAT ALICIA IS SIMPLY
AN EXTENSION OF ME.

270
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,997
I HEAR MY WORDS
COMING FROM HER,
MY EMOTIONS.

271
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,916
THE THINGS THAT SHE
HAS LEARNED TO LOVE

272
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,210
ARE THOSE THINGS
THAT I'VE LOVED.

273
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,468
I'M NOT LONELY ANYMORE.

274
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,596
EACH DAY CAN
NOW BE LIVED WITH,

275
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,306

WHAT'S THAT STAR?

286

THAT'S NOT A
STAR, THAT'S
A SH I P.

287

LAST TIME, NOT FOR
ANOTHER THREE MONTHS.

THEY STOP AT
THE OTHER ASTERO I DS,
THEN THEY COME HERE.

293
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,549
THAT MEANS
WE'LL SEE THEM
IN THE MORNING.

294
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:19,806

GET BACK TO
THE HOUSE THEN.

I DON'T HAVE 1 5
POU N DS OF STUFF.
