(narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,467
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,387
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,265
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,977
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,229
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,569
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,113
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,409
IT IS AN AREA

THE ONLY WORK HE'S
EVER DONE. THE ONLY
WORK HE KNOWS.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,151
HIS NAME IS
HENRY FRANCIS VALENTINE,
BUT HE CALLS HIMSELF ROCKY

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,487
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
HIS LIFE HAS BEEN.

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,282
ROCKY AND PERILOUS
AND UPHILL AT A DEAD
RUN ALL THE WAY.

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,495
HE'S TIRED NOW, TIRED
OF RUNNING OR WANTING

18
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,706
OF WAITING FOR THE
BREAKS THAT COME TO
OTHERS BUT NEVER TO HIM.

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,292
NEVER TO ROCKY VALENTINE.
