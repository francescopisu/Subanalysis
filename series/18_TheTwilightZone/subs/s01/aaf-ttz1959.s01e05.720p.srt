TRYING TO GO HOME AGAIN.

MAYBE A SUMMER
NIGHT SOMETIME,

WHEN HE'LL LOOK UP
FROM WHAT HE'S DOING

384
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,583
AND LISTEN TO THE DISTANT
MUSIC OF A CALLIOPE

385
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,669
AND HEAR THE VOICES
AND THE LAUGHTER

AND THE MERRY-GO-ROUNDS
OF HIS YOUTH.

392
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,350
AND HE'LL SMILE THEN TOO

393
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,811
BECAUSE HE'LL KNOW
IT IS JUST AN ERRANT WISH

394
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,022
SOME WISP OF MEMORY
NOT TOO IMPORTANT REALLY.
