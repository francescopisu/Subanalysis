A VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE TIME.

186
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,564
YOU WERE FIRED

187
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,274
FROM WHAT WAS
YOUR 1 1 TH JOB
IN 1 8 MONTHS.

188
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,277
MR. PECKIN PAUG H DIDN'T

00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,283
I CAN RECONSTITUTE

00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,673
DEF IN ITELY NOT.
WE'D CHANG E SOME ASPECTS.

199
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,842

00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,736
BUT IF YOU
WANT THE DAY
TO END DIFFERENTLY

206
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,863
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BE
DIFFERENT YOURSELF.
