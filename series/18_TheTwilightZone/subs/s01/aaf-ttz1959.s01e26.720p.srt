00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,589
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,092
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,012
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,015
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,518
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,895
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,898
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,193
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,863
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:35,534
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,259
A COMMONPLACE,
IF SOMEWHAT GRIM,
UNSOCIAL EVENT

13
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,261
KNOWN AS A
"NECKTIE PARTY."

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,765
THE GUEST OF DISHONOR,
A COWBOY NAMED JOE CASWELL,

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,933
JUST A MOMENT
AWAY FROM A ROPE,

16
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,644
A SHORT DANCE SEVERAL
FEET OFF THE GROUND.

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,731
AND THEN THE DARK
ETERNITY OF ALL EVIL MEN.

18
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:10,152
MR. JOE CASWELL,
WHO WHEN THE GOOD LORD
PASSED OUT A CONSCIENCE,

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,571
A HEART OF FEELING
FOR FELLOW MEN,

20
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,783
MUST HAVE BEEN
OUT FOR A BEER
AND MISSED OUT.

21
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,661
MR. JOE CASWELL
IN THE LAST
QUIET MOMENT

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,456
OF A VIOLENT LIFE.

23
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,672
REVEREN D.
NO NEED, I AIN'T
INTERESTED IN PRAYERS.

24
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,343
AND YOUR IMMORTAL
SOU L, CASWELL?

25
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,512
ARE YOU
INTERESTED IN THAT?

26
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,516
IT'S MY MORTAL N ECK
THAT CONCERNS ME NOW.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,188
AND IT'S GONNA BE YOUR
PLEASURE TO SEE THAT IT'S
STRETCH ED A COUPLE FEET.

28
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,691
S I NCE THAT BOOK
AIN'T GOING TO H ELP,

29
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,153
MIGHT AS LEAVE
MAKE IT SHORT AND
GET IT OVER WITH.

30
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,114
J U DG E?

31
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,783
YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO SAY? IT'S YOUR
RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,454
THAT'S MY RIGHT,
IS IT, J U DG E?

33
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,875
THE YOU NG FELLOW I PUT
A HOLE IN HAD TOO MUCH
MOUTH, NOT ENOUGH BRAI NS.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,130
I'D I NVITE HIM OUT
AGAIN TOMORROW IF I HAD
IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN.

35
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,465
YOU SHOT MY SON
IN THE BACK, CASWELL.

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,969
AND THAT'S A LONG COU NTRY
M I LE FROM AN I NVITATION
TO A SHOWDOWN.

37
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,347
NOW, THAT'S ALL
YOU GOT TO SAY,
I GOT THIS TO ADD.

38
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,641
I'D LIKE IT
TO TAKE AWHILE.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,893
I'D LIKE YOU TO
FEEL IT, CASWELL.

40
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:30,232
THE MORE YOU KICK, THE
MORE J USTICE IF IG U RE
THERE IS IN THE WORLD.

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,235
WELL, I'LL DO A
J IG FOR YOU, PAPPY,

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,196
JUST LIKE A PU PPET.

43
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,907
HOW ABOUT IT,
CAN'T WE GET IT
OVER WITH?

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:44,413
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, CASWELL.
YOU'RE AN EVI L PERSON.
YOU'RE A DISEASE.

45
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,167
AND WHEN WE HANG YOU,
IT'S A SERVICE.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,045
ALL RIGHT, GET ON
WITH THE JOB.

47
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,077
OH, MY DEAR GOD.

48
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,705
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

49
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,604
TRY TO RELAX.
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,190
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

51
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,655
[raspy voice]
WHERE AM I?

52
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,990
YOU'RE A LONG
WAY FROM HOM E,
OLD FRI EN D.

53
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,077
A VERY LONG WAY.

54
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,913
[raspy voice]
WHERE?

55
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,332
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY,

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,628
EIGHTY YEARS FROM
THE LAST MOM ENT OF
YOUR RECOLLECTION.

57
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,090
HOW? HOW?

58
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,009
[gasping]

59
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,351
BY THIS. THIS IS
A TIME MACHINE.

60
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:34,481
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU
I NVOLVES PRI NCI PLES WHICH
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

61
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:40,279
FOR THE MOM ENT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR PAST WAS,

62
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,156
BUT YOU'VE GOT A MOST
DISTING U ISH ED FUTU RE.

63
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,202
YOU'RE THE FIRST
TIME TRAVELER IN
THE H ISTORY OF MAN.

64
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,206
AND I'M GOING
TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,377
AND YOU'RE GON NA
TELL ME ABOUT
AN OLD ON E.

66
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:24,323
(scientist)
AT 8: 1 5 THE SUBJECT
APPEARED DESPERATELY TIRED,

67
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,075
SO I PUT HIM TO BED.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,245
AFTER TWO HOURS
I'VE DISCOVERED
THE FOLLOWING :

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,831
HIS NAME IS
JOSEPH CASWELL.

70
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:37,836
HE TELLS ME HE WAS A
TRAI L BOSS ON A CATTLE RANCH
IN THE TERRITORY OF MONTANA.

71
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,923
HIS LAST MOM ENT
OF RECOLLECTION

72
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,845
WAS NOVEM BER 1 4, 1 880.

73
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:51,558
HE SAYS HE WAS
RI DING H ERD WH EN
SU DDEN LY HE BLACKED OUT.

74
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,854
HE AWOKE TO F IN D
HIMSELF ON THE COT
OF MY LABORATORY.

75
00:05:55,938 --> 00:06:00,359
HE FELT NO
SENSATIONS AND--

76
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:06,239
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW MOM ENTS
DID HE SEEM TO HAVE ANY GRASP
OF WHAT HAS OCCU RRED.

77
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,269
THERE'S ONE
DISTU RBING PO I NT.

78
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,565
THERE ARE THE MARKS OF
A ROPE ETCH ED DEEPLY
INTO HIS N ECK.

79
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,985
HE HAS NO
EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

80
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,739
AND I HAVE ONE
OTHER OBSERVATION
HARDLY SCI ENTIF IC.

81
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,660
I DON'T LIKE HIS LOOKS.

82
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:56,248
I DON'T LIKE THE
EYES OR THE FACE
OR THE EXPRESS ION.

83
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,127
I GET A FEELING
OF DISQU I ET, I--

84
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,172
I GET A FEELING THAT
I'VE TAKEN A 1 9TH
CENTURY PRI M ITIVE

85
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,885
AND PLACED HIM IN
A 20TH CENTURY J U NG LE.

86
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,517
AND H EAVEN
H ELP WHOEVER
G ETS IN HIS WAY.

87
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,270
[door opens]

88
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,243
THAT'S F I RE RIGHT
OUT OF THE AIR.

89
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,663
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TIRED.

90
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,749
I AM.

91
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,418
THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME TO SLEEP.

92
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,545
AND PLENTY OF
TIME FOR THAT.

93
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,382
NOW I WANNA LOOK AT
THAT WORLD OUT THERE.

94
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,267
I WANNA SEE IF THERE ARE
THINGS OUT THERE LIKE
YOU DESCRI BED TO ME.

95
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,520
CARRIAG ES WITHOUT
HORSES AND BU I LDINGS--

96
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,897
THEY'RE OUT
THERE, CASWELL.

97
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,274
THINGS THAT YOU'VE
N EVER SEEN BEFORE.

98
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,027
THINGS YOU
CAN'T I MAG IN E.

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,659
[engines humming,
horns honking]

100
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,956
[sirens wailing
and engines throbbing]

101
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,550
BUT SOME THINGS
DON'T CHANG E.

102
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,803
IDEAS, CONCEPTS,

103
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,973
THINGS LIKE
RIGHT AND WRONG.

104
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,060
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
RIGHT AND WRONG.

105
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,397
ONCE THERE WAS A DEPUTY
SH ERI FF IN DODG E CITY.

106
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:30,610
TRI ED TO BEAT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THEM INTO MY BACK
WITH A WET ROPE.

107
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,905
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
RIGHT AND WRONG.

108
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,325
AND WHAT ABOUT
J USTICE, CASWELL?

109
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,953
WHAT ABOUT J USTICE?

110
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,001
AM I SU PPOSED TO
KNOW ABOUT J USTICE?

111
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,753
MORE THAN MOST
M EN, PROBABLY.

112
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,842
RIGHT AND WRONG,
THEY CAN TRY TO
BEAT INTO YOU.

113
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,430
BUT J USTICE, CASWELL,

114
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,807
THIS CAME AT THE EN D
OF A ROPE, DIDN'T IT?

115
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,476
THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE
WHEN I REACHED
BACK INTO TIME.

116
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,104
YOU WERE AT THE EN D
OF A ROPE, WEREN'T
YOU, CASWELL?

117
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,899
SIX OR EIGHT FEET OFF
THE GROU N D, AND I GOT TO YOU
IN THAT FRACTION OF A MOM ENT

118
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,111
BEFORE YOUR
N ECK WAS BROKEN.

119
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,947
WHEN YOU'RE DANG LING
AT THE END OF A ROPE
IT DON'T MATTER

120
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,993
WH ETHER YOU'RE
ONE FOOT OFF THE
G ROU N D OR ONE H U N DRED.

121
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,620
YOU KI LLED SOMEON E.

123
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,250
I STOPPED
COUNTING AFTER 20.

124
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,843
WELL?

125
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,056
I'M GOING TO HAVE

126
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,516

127
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,226

128
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,314

129
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,275
AND THAT'S SU PPOSED

130
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,365
I DIED ONCE

131
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,033

00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,661
AND THOSE 20 MEN THAT

133
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,704
THEY DIED WITH
NO DISCOM FORT?

134
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,582
MISTER, Y-YOU'RE
JUST TALKING WORDS.

135
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,126
J USTICE, RIGHT

JUST A FEW FEET AWAY
FROM A SOFT BED.

139
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,265
THEY SOU N D NICE AND
THEY GO DOWN EASY!

140
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,442
BUT YOU JUST TRY 'EM
ON AN ICE-COLD MESA

141
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,405
WHERE ANOTHER MAN'S BREAD
OR ANOTHER MAN'S JACKET

142
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,866
STANDS BETWEEN YOU
AND STAYING ALIVE.

143
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,793
YOU GET IN THIS MACHINE
OF YOURS AND YOU GO
BACK TO WHERE I WAS,

144
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,714
AND YOU TALK ABOUT
YOUR LAW AND YOUR
ORDER AND YOUR J USTICE.

145
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,299
THEY'RE GONNA
SOUND DIFFERENT!

146
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,013
MISTER, I KNOW

00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,815
I DON'T LIKE
HIS LOOKS.

153
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,612
I DON'T LIKE THE
