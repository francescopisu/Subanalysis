(male narrator)
THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,968
BEYOND THAT
WHICH IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,971
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,890
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,561
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,896
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,066
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,819
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,613
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,075
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

JOEY CROWN, MUSICIAN
WITH AN ODD, INTENSE FACE,

14
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,025
WHOSE LIFE IS A QUEST
FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS.

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,235
LIKE FLOWERS IN CONCRETE,

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,821
OR LIKE TRYING TO PLUCK
A NOTE OF MUSIC OUT
OF THE AIR

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,450
AND PUT IT UNDER
GLASS TO TREASURE.

[music stops,

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,655

LISTEN, I, UH--

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,536
I BROUGHT ALONG
MY BABY,

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,955
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED
SOMEBODY WITH A HORN.

24
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,332
UH, NOT TONIGHT, JOEY.

25
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,501
THE LAST TIME YOU
PLAYED TRUMPET FOR ME,

26
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,252
YOU LOUSED IT UP.

27
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,505
I HAD TO SHARE
YOU WITH A BOTTLE.

28
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,675
A BOTTLE? ME?

29
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,677
I FORGOT WHAT
THE STUFF TASTES LIKE.

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,054
SIX, SEVEN MONTHS,
I'M WAY UP ON
THE WAGON.

31
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,514
SURE, JOEY, SURE.

32
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,352
WHAT AM I?
SOME KIND
OF KOOK?

33
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,231
LOOK, BARON, I KNOW
WHAT THAT STUFF
DOES TO ME, BUT--

34
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,983
I AIN'T AN OLD MAN.

35
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,901
ME AND THE HORN,
WE GOT A LOT OF
YEARS LEFT.

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,736
I COULD BE A
NUMBER ONE BOY.

37
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,199
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
CHUCK IT AWAY ON
SOME BUM HAB IT?

38
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,617
LISTEN, I--

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,786
IT'S A PRETTY
MELLOW HORN.

40
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,746
I GOT SOME NICE
MUSIC IN HERE.

41
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,249
YOU KNOW YOURSELF,
WHEN I PICK IT UP
AND I BLOW IT,

42
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,709
I CAN MAKE 'EM CRY!

43
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,006
WHAT DO
YOU SAY, BARON?

44
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,105
DON'T DO IT.

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,941
FOR OLD TIMES,
JOEY, HUH?

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,277
FOR OLD TIMES
WHEN YOU HAD IT.

47
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,820
A MAGIC HORN.

AND MAX KAMINSKY,

49
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,243
AND BUTTERFIELD,
A LITTLE B IT OF
ALL OF 'EM, BABY!

50
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,329
YOU TRADED IT OFF
FOR SOME BAD HOOCH

51
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,748
AND YOU GOT TOOK.

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,876
YOU GOT THE CRUMMY
END OF THE STICK!
WHY, JOEY, WHY?

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,007
BECAUSE I'M SAD,

54
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,092
BECAUSE I'M NOTHING,

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,596
BECAUSE I'LL LIVE AND DIE
IN A CRUMMY ONE-ROOMER

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,933
WITH DIRTY WALLS
AND CRACKED PIPES.

57
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,936
I'LL NEVER EVEN
HAVE A GIRL.

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,437
I'LL NEVER BE ANYBODY.

59
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,148
HALF OF ME
IS THIS HORN.

60
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,318
I CAN'T EVEN
TALK TO PEOPLE, BARON,

61
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,780
'CAUSE THIS HORN,
THAT'S HALF MY LANGUAGE.

62
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,953
BUT WHEN I'M DRUNK, BARON,

63
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,373
OH, WHEN I'M DRUNK, BOY,

64
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,335
I DON'T SEE
THE DIRTY WALLS
OR THE CRACKED PIPES,

65
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,045
I DON'T KNOW
THE CLOCK'S GOING,

66
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,965
THAT THE HOU RS
ARE GOING BY,

67
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,800
'CAUSE THEN I'M GABRIEL.

68
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,390
OH, I'M--I'M GABRIEL
WITH A GOLDEN HORN.

69
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,310
AND WHEN I PUT IT
TO MY LIPS, IT--

70
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,980
COMES OUT JEWELS.

71
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,733
IT COMES OUT A SYMPHONY--

72
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,986
COMES OUT THE SMELL OF--

73
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:43,365
OF FRESH FLOWERS IN SUMMER.

74
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,576
COMES OUT BEAUTY.

75
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,120

THANKS.

175
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,817
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

176
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,322
YOU SAID THANKS.

177
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,240
THANKS.

178
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,076
YOU HEAR ME?

179
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,827
I HEAR YOU.

180
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,996
YOU SEE ME?

181
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,581
VERY CLEARLY.

182
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,333
OH, YOU'RE A
GHOST TOO, HUH?

183
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,585
[chuckIes]
NOT REALLY.

184
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,379
I AM. I
STEPPED IN FRONT

185
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,673
OF A RATHER LARGE
VEHICLE THIS MORNING,

186
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,093
I [unintelligible],
BELIEVE ME.

187
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,429
YOU WANNA BLOW THIS
A WHILE, JOEY?

188
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,182
YEAH.

189
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,060
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO.

190
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,603
YOU MIND?

191
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,106
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

192
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,194
JOEY? YOU
CALLED ME JOEY.

193
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,238
JOEY CROWN,
THAT'S THE NAME,
ISN'T IT?

194
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,407
YEAH, THAT'S
MY NAME BUT--

195
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,367
WE AIN'T NEVER
BEEN INTRODUCED.

196
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,285
NOT FORMALLY
BUT I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

197
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,455
YOU PLAY
A NICE TRUMPET.

198
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,624
I KNOW,
I'M AN EXPERT
ON TRUMPETS.

199
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,877
YOU AIN'T NO SLOUCH
ON IT, THAT'S
FOR SURE.

200
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,006
WELL, GO AHEAD.

201
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,591
OKAY.

202
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,639
[previous melancholy tune]

203
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,782
[previousIy squeaky
high note, perfect]

204
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,667
HOW COME
YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?

205
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,462
YOU SAY YOU'RE
NOT A GHOST,
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

206
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,465
NO, I'M NOT DEAD.

207
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,091
NEITHER ARE YOU, JOEY.

208
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,099
I'M NOT?

209
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,392
BY NO MEANS.

210
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,482
BUT--WHAT ABOUT
THE PEOPLE IN
THE BAR?

211
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,941
THE GIRL IN
THE TICKET BOOTH

212
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,568
AND THE PEOPLE
IN THE STREETS?

213
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,570
THEY ARE DEAD.

214
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,865
THEY'RE THE GHOSTS, THEY
JUST DON'T KNOW IT,
THAT'S ALL.

215
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,786
SOMETIMES TO MAKE IT EASIER,
WE HAVE TO WORK IT
THAT WAY.

216
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,955
WE LET THEM GO ON IN
A LIFE THAT THEY'RE
FAMILIAR WITH.

217
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,625
THEY NEVER KNOW
FOR A LONG WHILE.

218
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,336
BUT THAT'S WHY
THEY COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

219
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,714
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S ALIVE.

220
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,300
BUT LIKE I SAID,
I STEPPED OFF
A CURB--

221
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,469
THAT YOU DID.

222
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,055
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE IN
A KIND OF A LIMBO, JOEY.

223
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,015
YOU'RE NEITHER
HERE NOR THERE.

224
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,809
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE.

225
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,894
BETWEEN THE TWO.

226
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:29,190
THE REAL
AND THE SHADOW.

227
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,109
WHICH DO YOU
PREFER, JOEY?

228
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,906
WHICH DO I PREFER?

229
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,783
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

230
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,369
I ALWAYS FELT
I WAS GETTING
DEALT FROM THE BOTTOM.

231
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,833
OR MAYBE, MAYBE
I JUST FORGOT HOW
MUCH THERE WAS FOR ME.

232
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,876
AND MAYBE I
FORGOT ABOUT--

233
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,420
ABOUT THE MUSIC THAT
I COULD MAKE ON
THIS HORN.

234
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,756
AND HOW NICE
IT SOUNDED.

235
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,675
AND GOING
INTO CHARLIE'S--

236
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,468
AND TALKING
TO PEOPLE--

237
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,513
AND MAYBE GOING TO
A MOVIE NOW AND
THEN, HUH?

238
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,182
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WON
A BEAUTY CONTEST BUT--

239
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,770
YOU KNOW, I HAD FRIENDS,
I MEAN, I HAD GOOD ONES.
GOOD ONES.

240
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,567
YEAH, SOMEWHERE ALONG
THE LINE I JUST FORGOT
ALL THE GOOD THINGS.

241
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,028
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
I JUST FORGOT.

242
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,698
YOU'VE GOT
A CHOICE,
YOU KNOW.

243
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,741
A CHOICE?

244
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,203
THERE'S STILL TIME.

245
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,455
WELL, IF I'VE
GOT A CHOICE,

246
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,375
I MEAN, IF I'VE
GOT A CHOICE--

247
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,085
THEN I WANNA GO BACK.

248
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,548
UNDERSTAND? I
WANNA GO BACK!

249
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,216
ALL RIGHT.

250
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,926
YOU GO BACK.

251
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,389
BUT JOEY,

252
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,309
NO MORE STEPPING
OFF CURBS.

253
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,145
TAKE WHAT YOU GET
AND YOU LIVE
WITH IT.

254
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,565
SOMETIMES IT'S
SWEET FROSTING,
NICE GRAVY.

255
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,986
SOMETIMES IT'S SOUR, IT
GOES DOWN HARD, BUT YOU
LIVE WITH IT.

256
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,990
YEAH, IT'S A NICE
TALENT YOU GOT.

257
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,744
TO MAKE MUSIC,
TO MOVE PEOPLE.

258
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,915
MAKE 'EM WANNA LAUGH,
MAKE 'EM WANNA CRY.

259
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,500
THEY CAN TAP THEIR FEET.

260
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,462
MAKE 'EM WANNA DANCE.

261
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,841
THAT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL
TALENT, JOEY.

262
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,134
DON'T WASTE IT.

263
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,600
SEE YOU AROUND, JOEY.

264
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,769
HEY!

265
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,937
HEY, MISTER!

266
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,396
WHAT IS IT, JOEY?

267
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,481
I DIDN'T GET
YOUR NAME!

268
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,066
HOW'S THAT?

269
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,859
YOU R NAME!
I DIDN'T GET

270
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,529

CALL ME GABE.

272
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,533

00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,786
GABE!

274
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,329
SHORT FOR GABRIEL.

275
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,084
GOODBYE, JOEY.

YOU STEPPED
RIGHT OUT IN

00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,337
LUCKY I ONLY
GRAZED YOU.

284
