00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,840
(male narrator)
THERE IS A
FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,551
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,470
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,390
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,144
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,479
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,566
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,152
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,155
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,450
IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

THE YEAR IS 191 7.

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,896
THE PROBLEM
IS THE LIEUTENANT

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,606
IS HOPELESSLY LOST.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,699
LIEUTENANT DECKER WILL

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,367
THAT A MAN CAN BE LOST

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,872
NOT ONLY IN TERMS
OF MAPS AND M ILES

23
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,707
BUT ALSO IN TIME.

24
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,627
AND TIME, IN THIS CASE,

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,504
CAN BE MEASURED
IN ETERNITIES.

26
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,526
[sirens blaring]

27
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,266
ALL RIGHT, MISTER.

ARE YOU AM ERICAN?

38

CAN'T YOU SEE THIS
IS AN AM ERICAN BASE?

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,548

40
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,217

00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,867
YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

83
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,959

YOU'RE NOT JOKING
WITH ME, ARE YOU?

88
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,377
GOOD LORD.

89
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,513
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY
EXPECT US TO
BELIEVE THAT--

90
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,140
BUT IT'S TRU E.
IT'S TRU E.

00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,710
I COULDN'T
HEAR MY ENG IN E.

96
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,591
IT WAS LIKE
BEING SWALLOWED
IN A VACU U M.

97
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,808
THE SAME SORT OF THING
HAPPENED TO GU I MERD.

98
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,351
THE FRENCH
FIGHTER PILOT?

99
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:22,732
HE DISAPPEARED
ONE DAY WHILE FLYING.

100
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:27,154
AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE,
THE CARDI NAL SAID

101
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,781
"HE BELONG ED TO THE SKY

102
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,743
AND THE SKY
HAS TAKEN HIM."

103
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,620
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE FOOLING,
DECKER?

104
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,955

HOW DID YOU KNOW?

114
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,847
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT TO DO WITH--

115
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,516
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

116
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,810
I SU PPOSE YOU'RE

117
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,480
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,443
IS AT THIS MOM ENT
EN ROUTE TO
THIS BASE

120
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,445
FOR A TOU R
OF I NSPECTION!

121
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,031
BUT THAT'S IMPOSS I BLE.

122
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:17,621
WHY IS IT IMPOSS I BLE,
LI EUTENANT DECKER?

123
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,122
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

124
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,724
(Harper)
IT'S INGENIOUS, I'LL
GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.

125
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,476
THIS COULD BE
CHECKED ON, S I R.

126
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,605
IF WE WANTED
TO WASTE OU R
TIME, YES.

127
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,901
WELL, I F
IT'S A HOAX,

128
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,403
IT'S CERTAINLY
AN ELABORATE ONE.

129
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,906
IF IT'S A
HOAX, MAJOR.

130
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,574
I MEAN, S I R,

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,493
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT ANYONE WOULD GO

132
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,079
TO SUCH I NCREDI BLE
LENGTHS JUST TO
PLAY A JOKE.

133
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,915
WHO SAID IT
WAS A JOKE?

134
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,458
ALRIGHT, S I R,
WHAT IS IT?

135
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,586
WE'LL F IN D OUT
WHEN MACKAYE ARRIVES.

136
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,509
WE COULD ASK THE
M IN ISTRY OF WAR
IN LON DON.

137
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,012
THERE MIGHT
BE RECORDS ON
THIS DECKER.

138
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,431
I THINK YOU
BELIEVE HIM.

139
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,975
NO, S I R.

140
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,560
IT'S JUST THAT I
CAN'T H ELP FEELING

141
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,812
THERE'S MORE TO THIS
THAN JUST A HOAX.

142
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,527
EXACTLY.

143
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,779
YOU DON'T THINK
HE MEANT TO USE
THAT ON MACKAYE?

144
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,864
WE'LL KNOW
SOON ENOUGH.

145
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,325
BUT, S I R, I'D
SWEAR THE MAN WAS
G EN U IN ELY SHOCKED

146
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,286
WHEN HE HEARD
MACKAYE WAS
COMING HERE.

147
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,454
IF H E'D MEANT
TO DO THE MAN
ANY HARM

148
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,456
HE WOULD'VE WORN HIS GU N,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT IT
IN HIS PLAN E.

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,458
MAJOR, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

150
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,669
BUT, GEN ERAL,
THIS WHOLE IDEA
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

151
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,755
MAJOR! I F
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,299

WHY AM I A

157
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,087
NOT QU ITE AS BAD
AS ALL THAT.

158
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,798
I'M BEING KEPT HERE,
AM I NOT?

159
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,717
I'M ONLY FOLLOWING

161
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,137
FOR ME TO

162
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,639
WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAI D
OF SEEING MACKAYE?

163
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,682
I'M NOT AFRAI D.

164
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,808
I'M NOT AFRAI D

165
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,518
WELL, THEN?

166
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,437
WELL, ALL RIGHT,

167
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,523

LAN DING AT AN AM ERICAN
BASE IN FRANCE IN 1 959?

176
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,336
SUCH A THING J UST
DOESN'T HAPPEN
EVERY DAY!

177
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,047
WELL, IT HAPPENED TODAY!

178
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,508
NOW, LOOK HERE, I'VE TOLD
YOU I'LL SEE MACKAYE.

179
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,385
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALON E?

180
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,689
YOUREALLY FEEL YOU
KNOW HIM, DON'T YOU?

181
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,815
KNOW HIM?

182
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,694
"OLD LEADBOTTOM?"

183
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,572
LEADBOTTOM?

184
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,576
YEAH, WELL,
WHEN EVER WE FLY--

185
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,413
WHEN EVER WE FLEW
OVER THE GERMAN LIN ES

186
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,374
THE SOLDI ERS F I RED AT US.

187
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:54,921
WELL, ONE DAY MACK GOT H IT
IN A MOST EM BARRASSING SPOT.

188
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,884
I ALWAYS CALLED HIM
OLD LEADBOTTOM AFTER THAT.

189
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,096
IT'S A PRIVATE JOKE,
OF COURSE.

190
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,764
MACK'S A PROU D FELLOW,
YOU KNOW.

191
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,268
HE WOULDN'T LIKE IT
IF I BRU ITED IT ABOUT.

192
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,021
BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP
I NS ISTING THAT
HE'S DEAD?

193
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,857
BECAUSE THE LAST
I SAW OF HIM

194
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,860
HE WAS CAUG HT IN A CI RCLE
OF SEVEN GERMAN PLAN ES.

195
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,362
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD
DO ABOUT IT, OF COURSE.

196
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,364
I WAS I NVOLVED
WITH THREE OTH ERS.

197
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,200
OBVIOUSLY, H E
GOT AWAY.

198
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,369
I DON'T SEE
HOW HE COULD HAVE.

199
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,288
NOT ONLY COULD
HAVE, HE DID.

200
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,667
HE WAS ONE OF
BRITAI N'S GREAT
H EROES DU RING THE BLITZ.

201
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,879
THAT WAS
THE SECON D WAR
WE TOLD YOU ABOUT.

202
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,264
WON THE D.F.C. FOR
KNOCKING DOWN THREE
GERMAN BOMBERS

203
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,767
ONE NIGHT OVER LONDON.

204
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,144
HE UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED
HUNDREDS OF LIVES.

205
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,645
MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS.

206
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,983
DECKER!

207
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,491
YOU MANAG E, S I R?

208
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,992
YES, YOU CAN
WAIT OUTSIDE.

209
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,336
WHAT'S WRONG, DECKER?

210
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,462
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE!

211
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,672
THAT'S IMPOSS I BLE.

212
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,091
MACKAYE WILL BE HERE
IN A WHILE. WE'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

213
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,134
I CAN'T SEE HIM.

214
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,552
WHY NOT?

215
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,595
HE'LL KNOW
ME FOR WHAT
I AM.

216
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,638
WHAT ARE YOU?

217
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,722
I'M A COWARD!

218
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,515
I'M A COWARD.

219
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,438
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A COWARD.

220
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,858
ALL MY LIFE I'VE
BEEN RU N NING AWAY

221
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,111
PRETEN DING TO BE SOMETHING
I NEVER WAS, NEVER COULD BE.

222
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,571
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE--

223
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,782
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO RU N AWAY.

224
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,034
BECAUSE I WANTED
SO DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE

225
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,202
THAT I DID ESCAPE.

226
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,458
OH, I GOT BY WITH MY
PRETENDING WELL ENOUGH.

227
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,379
MY KIND OF
STRAIN ED I DIOCY

228
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,299
IS EXACTLY
THE BRAND WE
ALL PUT ON.

229
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,011
WE'RE PLAYING A PART,
YOU KNOW?

230
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,558
BOYS ON A
LARK--LAUGHING,
JOKING, DRINKING--

231
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,894
OH, IT'S TOO MUCH,
ALL OF IT.

232
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,649
AND TURNING INTO DEADLY,
ICE-COLD KI LLERS
IN THE SKY

233
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,236
ALTHOUGH NOT ME,
OF COURSE.

234
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,738
NO, NOT ME.

235
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:32,495
U P THERE, I'M
JUST AS AFRAI D
AS I AM ON THE GROU N D.

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,082
AND MACK AND I ARE SU PPOSED
TO GO ON PATROLS TOGETHER

237
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,752
BUT, UH... I CAN USUALLY
MANAG E TO PERSUADE HIM

238
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,754
INTO SPLITTING UP.

239
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,590
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE ACTUALLY HOPES

240
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,509
HE'LL RU N
INTO SOME TROU BLE.

241
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,555
M E, WELL, I J UST...
LING ER IN THE CLOU DS

242
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,934
FLYING BACK AND FORTH,
DREADING THE POSS I B I LITY

243
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,021
THAT I MIGHT SEE
AN EN EMY PLAN E, AND...

244
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,939
JUST HOPING
FOR ENOUGH TIME TO PASS

245
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,776
SO THAT I CAN GO BACK.

246
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,362
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK...

247
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,699
I'LL LAND BEH IN D
THE GERMAN LIN ES

248
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,618
AND I'LL LET
MYSELF BE CAPTU RED.

249
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,080
THE PILOTS
ALWAYS GET THE BEST
OF TREATM ENT, YOU KNOW.

250
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,460
BUT I'M AFRAI D
OF DOING THAT EVEN.

251
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,297
I'M AFRAI D THAT I'D
BE DISCOVERED, AND--

252
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,132
DISCREDITED.

253
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,552
I COULDN'T BEAR THAT.

254
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:35,308
I HAVE TO CARRY ON
THE SELF-DELUSION,
YOU KNOW.

255
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,560
YOU KNOW--

256
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,729
I'VE ACTUALLY
F I RED BU LLETS

257
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,230
TH ROUG H THE
COCKP IT WALLS

258
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,774
SO THAT THE CHAPS
WILL SEE THEM

259
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,319
AND BE IMPRESSED.

260
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,862
GOD H ELP ME.

261
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,335
[sigh]

262
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,095
IT ISN'T A CRI ME
TO BE AFRAI D, DECKER.

263
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,932
EVERYBODY'S AFRAI D
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTH ER.

264
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,101
I'M SURE MACKAYE
WOULD U N DERSTAND THAT.

265
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,103
NO.

266
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,107
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK HE KNOWS ANYWAY?

267
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,152
BECAUSE IT WAS
ME THAT LET THE
G ERMANS TRAP HIM.

268
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,946
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID

269
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,197
YOU WERE FIGHTING THREE
G ERMAN PLAN ES YOURSELF.

270
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,657
I WASN'T FIGHTING ANYONE!

271
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,159
I WAS RU N NING!
I WAS RU N NING!

272
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,037
WHEN THE GERMANS CAME AT US,
I LEFT HIM UP THERE TO DIE.

273
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,455
BUT HE DIDN'T DIE!

274
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,124
WELL, I CAN'T
U N DERSTAND THAT!

275
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,799
WELL, MAYBE H E
GOT H ELPED SOMEHOW.

276
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,476
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

277
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,857
WHAT YOU SAID.

278
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,650
WHAT?

279
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,360
THAT HE GOT H ELP.

280
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,738
IT'S CERTAIN LY IN THE
REALM OF POSS I B I LITI ES.

281
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,740
DON'T YOU SEE?

282
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,909
MAYBE IT WAS ME
THAT H ELPED HIM.

283
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,286
I SAID WH EN
HE GOT H ELP

284
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,829
I MEANT THAT
SOMEBODY ELSE--

285
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,914
THERE WASN'T ANYONE
WITH IN 50 M I LES

286
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,083
WHO COULD
HAVE H ELPED HIM.

287
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,836
MAYBE IT
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT
THAT I LAN DED HERE.

288
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,921
MAYBE I WAS BROUGHT HERE
FOR A PU RPOSE--

289
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,674
TO F IN D OUT THAT
MACK HAD SU RVIVED.

290
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,844
TO F IN D OUT THAT TIME
WAS GIVING ME A
SECON D CHANCE.

291
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,512
YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME GO.

292
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,930
BUT I CAN'T.

293
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,307
YOU'VE GOT TO,
DON'T YOU SEE?

294
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,683
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
I HAVE.

295
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,310
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
HE HAS.

296
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,936
BUT HE'S ALIVE.
HE'S COMING
HERE TODAY.

297
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,730
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT IF I DON'T GET BACK

298
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,523
HE WON'T BE HERE?

299
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,484
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT HE WON'T
HAVE BEEN KI LLED

300
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,111
42 YEARS AGO
U N LESS I H ELP HIM NOW?

301
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,072
THAT'S I NSAN ITY, DECKER.

302
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,290
(technician)
HEY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

303
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,140
(Wilson)
TURN IT OFF!

304
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,474
NO.

305
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,893
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

306
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,477
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

307
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,812
IT'S ALL THOSE
OTHER LIVES
HE SAVED.

308
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,314
ARE THEY TO BE LOST AS WELL?

309
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,524
TURN IT OFF, DECKER,
OR I'LL F I RE.

310
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,735
WELL, F I RE.

311
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,153
I'D RATHER DIE.

00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,533
YOU'RE IN TROU BLE, MAJOR.

313
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,910

00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,703
I KNOW IT, S I R.

315
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,039
YOU KNOW, YOUR THOUGHT

THEY POS ITIVELY ELU DE ME.

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,960
LETTING THAT MAN IAC LOOSE.

318
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,461
HOW COULD YOU POSS I BLY--?

319
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,796
