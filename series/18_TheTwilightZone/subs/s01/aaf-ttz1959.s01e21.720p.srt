00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,716
(male narrator)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,051
BEYOND THAT
WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,138
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,099
AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,020
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,313
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,442
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,319
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,947
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,993
IT IS AN AREA
WHICH WE CALL
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,375
[thunder]

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,210
EXCUSE ME.

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,503

WHEN WILL IT BE I N?

21
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,811
HARD TO SAY.
BEEN RAINING HARD.

22
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,814
ROAD'S SLICK.
MAYBE A BRI DG E
OR TWO OUT.

23
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,317
THAT'LL PLAY HARD
WITH THE SCH EDU LE.

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,278
WELL, WHEN DO YOU
THINK IT WILL BE I N?

25
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,490
SHE'LL BE IN
WHEN SHE'LL BE IN.

26
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,325
THAT'S ALL.

27
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,452
I TOLD YOU THAT
THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED.

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,037
THE LAST TIME I ASKED?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,039
THE LAST TIME I ASKED
WAS RIGHT NOW.

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,167
LOOK, ALL I WANT FROM YOU
IS A CIVI L ANSWER.

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,926
SITUATIONS JUST DON'T
CHANGE THAT RAPIDLY

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,887
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THE CORTLAND BUS.

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,932
IT WAS LATE WHEN YOU ASKED
A HALF HOUR AGO

36
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,726
LATE WHEN YOU COME BACK
1 5 M INUTES LATER

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,228
AND IT'S LATE NOW.

38
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,896
AND ALL THE ASKING
IN THE WORLD

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,774
AIN'T GOING TO PUSH IT NON E.

40
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,277
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN UP HERE--

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,506
NOW WHAT'S THE MATTER?

44
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,968
NOTHING.

45
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,597
NOTHING'S THE MATTER.

M ILLICENT BARNES, AGE 25,
YOUNG WOMAN WAITING FOR A BUS

47
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,734
ON A RAINY NOVEMBER NIGHT.

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,403
NOT A VERY IMAGINATIVE TYPE
IS MISS BARNES.

49
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,781
NOT GIVEN TO UNDUE
ANXIETY OF FEARS
OR FOR THAT MATTER

50
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,992
EVEN THE MOST
TEMPORAL FLIGHTS OF FANCY.

51
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,660
LIKE MOST YOUNG CAREER WOMEN,

52
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,747
SHE HAS A GENERIC
CLASSIFICATION

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,125
AS A "GIRL WITH A HEAD
ON HER SHOULDERS."

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,128
ALL OF WHICHIS MENTIONED NOW
BECAUSE IN JUST A MOMENT

WILL BE PUT TO A TEST.

57
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,760
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ASSAULT
HER SENSE OF REALITY

58
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,345
AND A CHAIN OF NIGHTMARES

59
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,972
WILL PUT HER SANITY
ON A BLOCK.

00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,727
WELL, IT'S J UST

70
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,021
IT'SIDENTICAL,
EVEN TO THE BROKEN HAN DLE.

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,857
WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF A GAME?

72
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,359
WHAT?

73
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,236
THAT IS YOUR BAG--

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,779

THAT'S WHERE
I'M GOING TONIGHT,
TO BU FFALO.

181
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,400
EVERYBODY KEEPS TELLING ME
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

182
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,443
THAT MAN WHO TAKES
THE TICKETS--

183
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,737
HE SAYS I KEEP ASKING
ABOUT THE BUS.

184
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,781
AND THE WOMAN IN
THE POWDER ROOM

185
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,701
SAYS I'VE BEEN IN THERE
BEFORE, AND I HAVEN'T.

186
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,035
AND MY BAG HERE,

187
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
[gasps]
MY BAG!

188
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,706
THERE IT IS.

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,124
OH.

190
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,959
OH, THANK GOD.

191
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,585
FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT

192
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,921
EVERYTHING WAS STARTING
ALL OVER AGAIN.

193
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,048
THAT MAN SAID I
CHECKED IT AND I HADN'T.

194
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,384
BUT THERE WAS A BAG,
ALMOST I DENTICAL TO M IN E

195
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,094
IN THE BAGGAG E ROOM.

196
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,346
AND THEN WHEN I CAM E
OUT OF THE POWDER ROOM

197
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,890
IT WASN'T THERE.

198
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,517
GO ON.

199
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,023
WELL, IT SOU N DS
VERY STRANG E BUT,

200
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,277
WHEN I CAME OUT
OF THE POWDER ROOM

201
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,028
I LOOKED
IN THE M I RROR

202
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,656
AND I COULD
SEE THE WHOLE
WAITING ROOM

203
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,033
IN THE M I RROR,
AND I--

204
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,958
WELL, WHAT DID YOU SEE,
MISS BARN ES?

205
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,966
I SAW MYSELF S ITTING
RIGHT HERE ON THIS BENCH.

206
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,887
IT'S DELUS IONS.

207
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,263
YES.

208
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,931
YES, THAT'S WHAT
IT MUST BE.

209
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,975
DELUS IONS, SOME SORT
OF DELUS IONS.

210
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,268
BUT I'M NOT S ICK.

211
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,020
I DON'T HAVE A TEM PERATU RE.

212
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,857
I'M NOT RU N NING A FEVER.

213
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,861
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST SEEING THINGS
THAT DON'T EXIST.

214
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:05,533
WHY DID THAT MAN
AND THAT WOMAN SAY
THAT THEY HAD SEEN ME BEFORE?

215
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,577
I DON'T KNOW.

216
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,455
THIS ON E'S TOUG H

217
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,542
WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?
WHAT-- WHAT'S WRONG?

218
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,461
I'M NOT SOME SORT OF KOOK,

219
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,297
I'VE NEVER HAD ANY
TROU BLE LIKE THIS BEFORE,

220
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,549
I MEAN, TROU BLE
WITH MY MIND.

221
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,551
OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T.

222
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,054
THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
SOM EPLACE.

223
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,472
THERE'S A REASON.

224
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,681
MAYBE--

225
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,810
MAYBE WHAT?

226
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,437
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
WHO RESEM BLES YOU.

227
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,730
THAT COULD BE IT.

228
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,398
OR MAYBE SOMEONE IS PLAYING

229
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,736
SOME KIND OF A JOKE
OR SOMETHING.

230
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,781
OH, IS THAT POSS I BLE?

231
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,407
OH, THAT'S TOO FANTASTIC

232
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,079
AND THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
ABOUT THE BAG.

233
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,290
AND ANYWAY, IF THERE IS
SUCH A PERSON, WHERE IS SH E?

234
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,335
WHERE IS THIS PERSON?

235

YOU'RE EASY
TO BE KIND TO.

244
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:17,480
NO, I MEAN, MORE
THAN JUST KIND.

245
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,943

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,821

257
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,201
YOU'VE GOT
A LONG WAIT.

00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,536
THAT'S
ALL RIGHT.

259
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,496
OKAY.

260
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,166
I'M SHUTTING OFF
SOME OF THESE LIGHTS.

261
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,044
"WHEN NOT IN USE,
TURN OFF THE J U ICE."

262
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,047
THAT'S WHAT
I ALWAYS SAY.

263
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,174
I BEST BE
GETTING HOM E.

264
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,135

00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,839
YOU DIDN'T GET ON.

276
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,591
I'M THIS
LATE ALREADY.

277
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,470
A FEW MORE
HOURS WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

278
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,851
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

279
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,607
IT'S VERY ODD, BUT,

280
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,359
I'VE BEEN REMEMBERING.

281
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,070
REMEMBERING WHAT?

282
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:38,246
ABOUT SOMETHING
I READ OR HEARD
ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO.

283
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,713
ABOUT DIFFERENT
PLAN ES OF EXISTENCE.

284
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,425
ABOUT TWO
PARALLEL WORLDS

285
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,594
THAT EXIST
SIDE BY SIDE

286
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,475
AND EACH OF US
HAS A COU NTERPART

287
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,102
IN THIS WORLD

288
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,814
AN D, AND SOMETIMES
TH ROUG H SOME FREAK

289
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,567
TH ROUG H SOMETHING

290
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,152
THIS COU NTERPART--

00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,779
AFTER THE TWO

292
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,489
COMES INTO OUR WORLD

293
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,158
AND IN ORDER
TO SU RVIVE

294
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,785
IT HAS TO TAKE OVER.

295
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,079
TAKE OVER?

296
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,124
REPLACE US.

297
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,336
MOVE US OUT
SO THAT IT CAN LIVE.

298
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,798
THAT'S A LITTLE
M ETAPHYS ICAL FOR ME.

299
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:35,636
I REMEMBER
READING IT SOMEWHERE.

300
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,391
EACH OF US HAS A TWI N
IN THIS OTHER WORLD,

301
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,145
AN I DENTICAL TWI N.

302
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,065

M I LLICENT, THERE'S
ANOTHER EXPLANATION.

304
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,694
THERE HAS TO BE.

305
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,157
ONE THAT COMES
WITH MORE REASON.

306
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,118
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT

307
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,997
BUT I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.

308
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,460
THIS OTHER WOMAN,
MY COU NTERPART--

309
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,754
FORGET ABOUT IT, PLEASE.

310
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:14,842
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

311
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,345
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

312
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,806

MAYBE HE'LL BRING H IS

00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,521

DRIVE US INTO SYRACUSE.

00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,397
I'LL CALL HIM.

317
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,988
