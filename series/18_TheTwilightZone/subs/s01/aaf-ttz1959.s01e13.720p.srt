00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,465
(male presenter)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,676
BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,682
AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,227
IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW.

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,604
BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,607
AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,527
AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.

10
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,405
THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,284
IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE
CALL THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,731
HIS NAME IS ARCH HAMMER.

13
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,401
HE'S 36 YEARS OLD.
HE'S BEEN A SALESMAN,
A DISPATCHER,

14
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,446
A TRUCK DRIVER
A CON MAN, A BOOKIE
AND A PART-TIME BARTENDER.

15
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,826
THIS IS A CHEAP MAN,
A NICKEL-AND-DIME MAN

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,622
WITH A CHEAPNESS THAT
GOES PAST THE SUIT
AND THE SHIRT.

17
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,501
A CHEAPNESS OF MIND,
A CHEAPNESS OF TASTE.

18
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,587
A TAWDRY LITTLE
SHINE ON THE SEAT
OF HIS CONSCIENCE

19
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,298
AND A DARK, GROOMED SQUINT
IN A WORLD WHOSE SUNLIGHT

20
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,634
HAS NEVER GOTTEN
THROUGH TO HIM.

21
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,429
BUT MR. HAMMER HAS
A TALENT DISCOVERED
AT A VERY EARLY AGE.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,932
THIS MUCH HE DOES HAVE.

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,684
HE CAN MAKE
HIS FACE CHANGE.

24
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,437
HE CAN TWITCH A MUSCLE.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,023
MOVE A JAW.

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,319
CONCENTRATE ON
THE CAST OF HIS EYES.

27
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,614
AND HE CAN
CHANGE HIS FACE.

28
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,243
HE CAN CHANGE IT
INTO ANYTHING HE WANTS.

29
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,130
MR. ARCHIE HAMMER,
JACK OF ALL TRADES,

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,966
HAS JUST CHECKED IN
AT $3.80 A NIGHT

31
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,802
WITH TWO BAGS, SOME
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS,

32
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,804
A MOST ODD TALENT,

33
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,432
AND A MASTER PLAN
TO DESTROY SOME LIVES.

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,965
[playing jazz]

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,386

36
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,556

? MY BENDING YOUR EAR ?

38
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,735
THIS TORCH
THAT I'VE FOUND

39
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,612
MUST BE DROWNED

40
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,447
OR JUST--

41
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,992
IT JUST
MIGHT EXPLODE.

42
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:12,000
? MAKE IT ONE
FOR MY BABY ?

43
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,419
? AND ONE MORE ?

44
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,340

HEY, MAGGIE!

47
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,189
HEY, SPORT,
UNRAVEL THE FLESH.

48
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,441
COME ON, MAGGIE,
HAVE A LITTLE DRINK.

49
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,485
I'D LOVE ONE.

50
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,781
VERY, VERY SOLITARY.
ALL BY MY LONESOME
IF YOU DON'T M IND.

51
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,700
OH.

52
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,910
IF YOU DON'T
DRINK WELL,

53
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,496
DON'T DRINK.

54
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,290
JOHNNY!

55
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,835
JOHNNY, ARE
YOU A GHOST?

56
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,671
SURE, A GHOST.

57
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,967
I JUST CAME DOWN TO
CHECK THE MOURNERS,
READ THE OBITUARIES.

58
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,180
HOW DID THEY FEEL
ABOUT THE DECEASED, HUH?

59
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,682
WHAT KIND OF TEARS?

60
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,851
YOU CAME TO THE
RIGHT PLACE, JOHNNY.

61
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,690
I HAVE A ROOMFUL
OF BUCKETS.

62
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,277
I HEARD IT ON THE
RADIO ONE NIGHT.
JUST LIKE THAT.

"DEATH AS IT MUST
COME TO ALL MEN,

66
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,338
I JUST SAT THERE
AND I CRIED.

67
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,758
AND THEN I--

68
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,390
AND THEN I WASHED
MY FACE AND--

69
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,892
PUT ON SOME MAKEUP
AND WENT TO WORK.

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,315
BUT EVERYTHING
HAD CHANGED FOR ME.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
MY REPERTOIRE
BECAME VERY LIMITED.

72
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,156
ONLY BOOZE.

73
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,828
ONLY SAD SONGS
FOR PIANO OR BOURBON.

74
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,080
OH, JOHNNY.

75
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,499
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU AREA GHOST.

76
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,336
NAH.

77
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,338
IT WAS ANOTHER GUY.

78
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,799

79
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,510
MAYBE WE EVEN HAD
THE SAME DENTIST.

80
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,345
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL PEOPLE THAT?

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,347
NAH.

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,058
I WANTED TO GET
WAY FROM THE WORLD.

83
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,562
FROM THAT.

84
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,443
I DECIDED
TO TRADE IN
THE OLD NAME.

85
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,279
TURN IT IN
FOR SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

93
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,479
IS THIS A STOP

WHY NOT?

137
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,045
HOW WAS THE WATER,
BABY? WAS IT COLD?

138
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,631

00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,256
WHO IS IT, RAMON?

143
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,759
IT'S ME, MR. PENELL.

144
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,433
PICTURE TUBES
ARE EXPENSIVE.

145
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,436
YOU CAN ALWAYS
GET YOURSELF
ANOTHER BEER.

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,146
IMPORTED, ISN'T IT?

147
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,440
I ALWAYS LIKED YOUR
TASTE, MR. PENELL.

148
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,276
YOU ALWAYS HAD
THE TASTE OF A
VERY RICH MAN.

149
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,361
NEAT BUT NOT GAUDY.

150
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,783
PLEASE. DON'T.

151
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,368
JUST SIT DOWN THERE
AND WE'LL TALK, HUH?

152
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,873
WE'LL HAVE A BUSINESS

THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE!

[laughs]

156
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,674
IF THIS IS THE
HAPPIEST DAY
OF YOUR LIFE,

157
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,804
HOW COME YOU LOOK LIKE
SOMEBODY JUST STUCK LEMON
JUICE IN YOUR BEER, HUH?

158
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,724
NO, MR. PENELL,
YOU'RE NOT SO HAPPY.

159
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,810
YOU GOT NO
REASON TO BE HAPPY.

160
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,813
BELIEVE ME,
MR. PENELL, I KNOW.

161
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,565
YOU'VE GOT NO
REASON TO BE HAPPY.

162
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,735
NO REASON AT ALL.

163
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,655
NOW, IF YOU COULD HAVE
KEPT ME IN THE RIVER,

164
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,407
A COLD, CLAMMY LITTLE
ITEM WITHOUT A VOICE,

165
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,451
THEN YOU COULD
HAVE BEEN HAPPY.

166
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,704
BUT THIS IS ONE DOUBLE
CROSS THAT CAME BACK
TO BITE YOU.

167
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,665
VIRG, VIRG, YOU
GOT ME WRONG, VIRG.

168
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,583
I HELD UP MY END
OF THE BARGAIN,

169
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,045
AND INSTEAD OF THE PAYOFF,
ALL I GOT WAS THE RIVER.

170
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,923
AND THAT RIVER
WAS COLD, MR. PENELL.

171
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,759
FAR TOO COLD FOR
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.

172
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,345

MR. PENELL,

173
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,181
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE

174
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,517
I BROUGHT BACK A SATCHEL
FOR YOU, MR. PENELL.

175
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,603
THERE WAS A LOT
OF MONEY IN IT. IT
WAS A REAL RISKY JOB.

176
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,731
NOW, I FIGURE MY CUT
IS MORE THAN A COLD SWIM!

177
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,942
VIRG, PLEASE,

178
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,194
VIRG, VIRG, I GOT
YOUR CUT, KID.

179
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,280
IT'S RIGHT OVER

180
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,576
I'LL TAKE CARE OF MY
OWN CUT, MR. PENELL.
WHAT DRAWER?

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,787
IT'S IN THE CENTER DRAWER.
THERE'S AN ENVELOPE
FULL OF MONEY.

182
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,622
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
GET IT FOR YOU?

183
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,791
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?

184
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,594

185
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,054

00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,724
THE CUT IS STILL
THE SAME, MR. PENELL.

187
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,477
I ALWAYS LIVE UP

188
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,438
ONLY NOW THERE'S INTEREST.

189
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,232

194
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,079

197
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,587
IS THAT THE QUESTION?

198
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,424
NO, MR. PENELL.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT HAPPENED AT ALL.

199
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,218
I'M A GHOST.

200
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,849
GET THAT GUY,
HE'S A FAKE!

201
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,715

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,301
