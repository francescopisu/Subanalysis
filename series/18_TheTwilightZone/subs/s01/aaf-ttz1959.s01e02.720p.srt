186
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,258
I'VE NEVER FLOWN--

187
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,760
(Death)
INSUFFICIENT, MR. BOOKMAN.

188
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,348
ANYTHING ELSE?

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,102
NOW YOU LOOK HERE.
I'VE LIVED IN THIS
ROOM FOR 2 1 YEARS.

190
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,897
AND YOU KEEP POPPING UP
IN CORN ERS OF THE ROOM

191
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,732
WILL YOU PLEASE
STAY IN ONE PLACE?

192
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,527
IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE, MR. BOOKMAN?

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,070
YES, YES.

194
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,948
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
A ZU LU WAR DANCE.

195
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,409
NOW THAT'S
THE ANSWER RIGHT THERE.

196
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,079
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE
ME A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GO
OVER TO THAT ZU LU COU NTRY

197
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,373
NO?

198
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,917
NO. U N F IN ISH ED BUS IN ESS
OF A MAJOR NATU RE

199
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,128
IS SOMETHING A MAN
HAD YEARNED FOR

200
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,964
AND SOMETHING
HE M IGHT ACCOMPLISH
GIVEN AN EXTENSION.

201
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,842
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING.

202
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,219
WHAT IS IT, MR. BOOKMAN?

203
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,055
WELL, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

204
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,766
I NEVER MADE
A TRU LY BIG P ITCH.

205
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,644
I MEAN, I MEAN
A BIG P ITCH.

206
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,898
A P ITCH BIG ENOUGH
FOR THE SKI ES TO OPEN UP.

207
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,402
YOU KNOW,
A PITCH FOR THE ANGELS.

208
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,071
OF COURSE,
IT WOULDN'T MEAN
VERY MUCH TO YOU,

209
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,906
BUT IT WOULD MEAN
A GREAT DEAL TO ME.

210
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,242
IT WOULD MEAN
THAT FOR ONE MOMENT

211
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,163
IN MY WHOLE LIFE
I WOULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING SUCCESSFUL.

212
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:28,293
IT WOULD MEAN
THAT MAYBE THE CH I LDREN
WOULD BE VERY PROU D OF ME.

213
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,503
THE CH I LDREN?

214
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,424
YES, YES, I'VE ALWAYS
HAD QU ITE A FON DN ESS
FOR CH I LDREN, YOU KNOW.

215
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,635
YES, THAT'S ALL
HERE IN THE RECORD.

216
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,972
THE PROBLEM HERE,
MR. BOOKMAN, IS THAT
YOU'D REQU I RE DELAY U NTI L--

217
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,932
U NTI L I MAKE A P ITCH!

218
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,518
THE KIND OF P ITCH
I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT.

219
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,978
THE ONE FOR THE ANGELS?

220
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,564
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE FOR THE ANGELS.

221
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,361
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
MR. BOOKMAN,

222
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,196
BUT, NO.

223
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,992
YOU SEE, THESE CATEGORIES
ARE VERY SPECIFIC

224
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,496
AND WHEN REFERENCE IS MADE
TO U N F IN ISH ED BUS IN ESS
OF A MAJOR NATU RE,

225
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,581
THE ONLY I NTERPRETATION
TO BE MADE HERE

226
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,166
IS S IMPLY THAT--

227
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,545
WHAT-- WHAT I MEAN
IS THAT, UH,

228
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,631
U N FORTU NATELY, MR. BOOKMAN,

229
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,509
AN AB I LITY TO, TO SUCCEED

230
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,386
IN A GIVEN
PROFESS IONAL VENTU RE

231
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,180
IS REALLY HARDLY
OF A MAJOR--

232
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,395
M EAN A GREAT
DEAL TO YOU, DOES IT?

233
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,814
A GREAT DEAL.

234
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,740
ALL RIGHT,
MR. BOOKMAN.

235
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,785
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I BELIEVE I CAN GRANT
YOU A DELAY.

236
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,704
U NTI L--

237
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,040
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'U NTI L?'
U NTI L YOU'VE MADE THIS P ITCH.

238
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,750
I CAN LIVE TI L THEN?

239
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,502
THAT'S THE AG REEM ENT.

240
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,005
OH, WELL I THINK
THAT'S A F IN E BARGAI N.

241
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,049
I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME.

242
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,094
NOW, ABOUT
THIS P ITCH, MR. BOOKMAN,

243
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,388
WHEN MIGHT
WE EXPECT IT?

244
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,098
WH EN?

245
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,059
OH, SOON.
YOU KNOW.

246
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,230
MAYBE NOT THIS YEAR, MAYBE
NOT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS,
[chuckIes] BUT SOON.

247
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,859
I HAVE THE VERY ODD FEELING
THAT YOU'RE TAKING
ADVANTAG E OF ME.

248
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,777
OH, YOU HAVE?
WELL, THAT'S A P ITY,

249
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,698
BECAUSE I AM!

250
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,117
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME
MAKING A P ITCH ANYMORE.

251
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,036
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FOOL ME, EH?
[chuckIes]

252
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,372
I'LL HARDLY OPEN
MY MOUTH FROM NOW ON.

253
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,623
[mischievous music]

254
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,959
REALLY, MR. BOOKMAN?

255
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,795
THIS IS MUCH MORE
SERIOUS THAN YOU I MAG IN E.

256
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,057
IT'S MUCH MORE COM PLEX
THAN YOUREALIZE, WHAT
YOU'VE JUST DONE.

257
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,573
HERE I'VE GON E
OUT OF MY WAY TO H ELP YOU

258
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,283
AND THIS IS THE WAY
YOUREPAY ME?

259
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,632
MR. BOOKMAN.

260
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,301
IT WON'T JUST END HERE,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

261
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,179
THERE WILL BE
CONSEQU ENCES, YOU SEE?

262
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,600
FYI, THAT MEANS
FOR YOU IN FORMATION

263
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,937
YOU MADE YOUR BED
AND YOU SHALL HAVE
TO SLEEP IN IT.

264
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,065
WE MADE A BARGAI N
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO GO
U NTI L I MAKE A P ITCH.

265
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,526
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
U NTI L I MAKE THAT P ITCH.

266
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,905
I CAN SAY THIS
WITHOUT THE LEAST
FEAR OF CONTRADICTION.

267
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,699
HAVE YOU GOT
A LONG WAIT!
[chuckIes]

268
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,868
THAT MAY WELL BE,
MR. BOOKMAN,

269
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,620
BUT S I NCE YOU WON'T
COME WITH ME,

270
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,498
I'VE BEEN FORCED
TO SELECT AN ALTERNATIVE.

271
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,583
[brakes screeching
and woman yelling]

272
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,630
[people shouting]

273
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,721
MAGG I E!

274
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,807
I SWEAR
I DIDN'T SEE H ER.

275
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,477

276
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,397
I SWEAR TO YOU
I NEVER HAD NO
CHANCE TO STOP AT ALL.

277
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,482
