1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,727
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,481
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,617
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,491
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,878
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,752
Tonight a presentation
so special and unique,

10
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:37,637
that for the first time
in the five years

11
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,506
we've been presenting
the twlight zone,

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,008
we're offering a film
shot in france by others.

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,145
Winner of the cannes
film festival of 1962,

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,647
as well as other
international awards,

15
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:50,150
here is a haunting study
of the incredible

16
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,269
from the past master of
the incredible, ambrose bierce.

17
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,155
Here is the french production

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,274
of "an occurrence
at owl creek bridge."

19
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:49,459
First squad, stand fast.

20
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:54,464
Fall out.

21
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:40,500
Libbie.

22
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,505
Libbie.

23
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,142
Take his watch.

24
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:08,644
Yes, sir.

25
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,162
Atten-hut!

26
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:12,328
A living man

27
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:19,218
i want to be a living man

28
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,721
in all the world

29
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:25,474
? he moves around?

30
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,594
? he walks around?

31
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,348
? he turns around?

32
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,102
? i see each tree?

33
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,738
? i read each vein?

34
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:41,857
? i hear each bug?

35
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:46,245
? upon each leaf?

36
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,614
? the buzzing flies?

37
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,368
? the splashing fish?

38
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,504
? they moves around?

39
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:01,127
? this living man?

40
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:04,380
? a living man?

41
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:08,134
? a living man?

42
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:13,022
? i want to be a living man.?

43
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:18,277
He must be hung!

44
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:23,282
Soldier, tell... to open fire!

45
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,151
Yes, sir.

46
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:30,790
If it is necessary,
fire the cannon as well!

47
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,295
Shoulder arms.

48
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,049
Guards, stand fast!

49
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:45,671
Steady, men. Steady.

50
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:50,176
He mustn't escape.

51
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,678
There he is.

52
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,432
He's moving.

53
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:03,689
Peyton farquhar,

54
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,692
you're caught
like a rat in a trap.

55
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,078
In a trap.

56
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,198
Trap. Trap.

57
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,729
Atten-hut!

58
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,867
Shoulder arms!

59
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,485
Ready!

60
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,736
Aim!

61
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,875
Fire!

62
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,631
Load!

63
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:17,146
Ready!

64
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:18,397
Load!

65
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,518
Fire!

66
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,661
Fire at will!

67
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,530
Commence firing!

68
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:27,026
? he walks around?

69
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:30,896
? he turns around?

70
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,033
? i see each tree?

71
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:37,152

00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,043

76
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,053
? they moves around?

77
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,555
? this living man.?

78
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:22,644
"An occurrence at owl creek
bridge" in two forms-

79
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,015
as it was dreamed
and as it was lived and died.

80
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,152
This is the stuff of fantasy,
the thread of imagination,

81
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:34,523
the ingredients
ofthe twilight zone.

82
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,692
And now, mr. Serling.

83
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,195
Twilight zoneregular
charles beaumont

84
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,446
brings us our next offering,

85
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,949
a tale of age and youth
and a beautiful woman.

86
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,085
Our star is ann blyth,
our story, "queen of the nile."

87
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,954
They say that beauty
is only skin deep,

88
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,205
and when the surface
is scratched,

89
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,090
what you might conceivably
find underneath

90
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,959
is something quite
apart from beauty.

91
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,844
This is the rather
intriguing basis

92
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,712
of our next presentation
onthe twilight zone.

93
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,849
Miss ann blyth
in "queen of the nile."
