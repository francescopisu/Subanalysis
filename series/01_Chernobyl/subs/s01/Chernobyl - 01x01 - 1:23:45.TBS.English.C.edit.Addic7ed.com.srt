1
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:40,144
What is the cost of lies?

2
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:43,102
It's not that we'll
mistake them for the truth.

3
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:47,060
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

4
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:50,104
then we no longer
recognize the truth at all.

5
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:53,352
What can we do then?

6
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:56,102
What else is left but to
abandon even the hope of truth

7
00:00:56,104 --> 00:01:00,769
and content ourselves
instead with stories?

8
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:04,977
In these stories, it doesn't
matter who the heroes are.

9
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,603
All we want to know is: who is to blame?

10
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,269
In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.

11
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,060
He was the best choice.

12
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:15,144
An arrogant, unpleasant man,

13
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,436
he ran the room that
night, he gave the orders...

14
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,436
and no friends.

15
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:24,104
Or, at least, not important ones.

16
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:29,406
And now Dyatlov will
spend the next ten years

17
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,532
in a prison labor camp.

18
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:34,910
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

19
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,187
There were far greater
criminals than him at work.

20
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,977
And as for what Dyatlov did do,

21
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,354
the man doesn't deserve prison.

22
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,354
He deserves death.

23
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:09,185
But instead, ten years for
"criminal mismanagement."

24
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,269
What does that mean?

25
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:15,021
No one knows. It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:20,769
What does matter is that, to them,

27
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:23,060
justice was done.

28
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:26,728
Because, you see, to them

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,438
a just world is a sane world.

30
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:35,896
There was nothing sane about Chernobyl.

31
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,853
What happened there,
what happened after,

32
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:43,187
even the good we did, all of it...

33
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:49,187
all of it... madness.

34
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:57,737
Well, I've given you everything I know.

35
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,101
They'll deny it, of course.

36
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:03,849
They always do.

37
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,937
I know you'll try your best.

Lyudmilla?

40
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,855
Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:11,396
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:19,028
Comrade
Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

43
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,519
What just happened?

44
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:24,686
I don't know.

45
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,896
There's a fire in the turbine hall.

46
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:29,771
The turbine hall.

47
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,977
The control system tank. Hydrogen.

48
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,387
You and Toptunov, you
morons blew the tank!

49
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,352
- No, that's not...
- This is an emergency.

50
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:40,520
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is...

51
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:41,935
- It's exploded!
- We know.

52
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,477
Akimov, are we cooling the reactor core?

53
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,394
We shut it down, but the
control rods are still active.

54
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,269
They're not all the way
in, I disengaged the clutch.

55
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,812
Try and disconnect the servos
from the standby console.

56
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,435
You two, get the backup pumps running.

57
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,023
We need water moving through the core.

58
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:56,268
- That is all that matters.
- There is no core.

59
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,686
It exploded, the core exploded.

60
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:04,352
He's in shock. Get him out of here.

61
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,686
The lid is off!

62
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,561
The stack is burning. I saw it.

63
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:10,519
You're confused. RBMK
reactor cores don't explode.

64
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,935
- Akimov...
- Sasha.

65
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,227
Don't worry, we did everything right.

66
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,269
Something... something
strange has happened.

67
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,477
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

68
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,477
Comrade Perevozschenko, what you're
saying is physically impossible.

69
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,813
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

70
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,269
We're wasting time. Let's go.

71
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,465
Get the hydrogen out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

72
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,394
- What about the fire?
- Call the fire brigade.

73
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,029
_

74
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,017

75
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,227
_

76
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:44,566
_

77
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,076
_

78
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:46,818
_

79
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:48,903
_

80
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,053
_

81
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:55,476
_

82
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,496
_

83
00:10:58,497 --> 00:10:59,455
_

84
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,040
_

85
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,365
_

86
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:03,192
_

87
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,127
_

88
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:08,693
_

89
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,436
You're not on call tonight.

90
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,889
They're bringing everybody
in, military and civil.

91
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,728
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

92
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,605
This is a big one.

93
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:23,443
But it doesn't look right, the color.

94
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:26,935
Pravik says he thinks they're
shining floodlights or something.

95
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,394
And what if there are chemicals?

96
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,730
Chemicals?

97
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,394
The problem's the roof.

98
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,269
It's covered in tar, so
it's gonna burn all night,

99
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,935
and it'll stink like hell. That's it.

100
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:40,771
That's the worst of it.

101
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,102
Go back to bed.

102
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,935
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

103
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:26,021
Here... Here.

104
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,479
Are they bombing?

105
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:39,144
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

106
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,769
That's as high as it goes. The
good one's locked in a safe.

107
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,269
I don't have a key.

108
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:47,521
Valera... your face.

109
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,477
Come on.

110
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,436
I'm going to find
Khodemchuk in the pump room.

111
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,477
You... here.

112
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,185
Get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go.

113
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:00,935
We need to get everyone out!

114
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:15,477
Shit.

115
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,935
Hey! We need to get to the reactor hall.

116
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:21,019
- The lift's destroyed.
- Up two flights and across.

117
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:24,519
- Right.
- Why are you going there?

118
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,811
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

119
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,271
- No. Where's Viktor?
- Still in the pump room.

120
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,688
Stay here. I'll come back.

121
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,278
Viktor!

122
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,545
Viktor.

123
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,673
Viktor.

124
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,811
Viktor. I'm gonna get you out of here.

125
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,769
Can you stand?

126
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,060
Khodemchuk...

127
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:29,730
Where?

128
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,313
Get Khodemchuk.

129
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,423
I dropped the control
rods from the other panel.

130
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:21,311
- They're still up.
- What?

131
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,811
They're still only a third of
the way in, I don't know why.

132
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:26,538
I already sent the trainees down to
the reactor hall to lower them by hand.

133
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,394
- What about the pumps?
- I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

134
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:31,371
- The lines are down.
- Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk.

135
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:32,874
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Stolyarchuk?

136
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,185
My control panel's not working.

137
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:35,686
I tried calling for the electricians.

138
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,394
I don't give a shit about the panel!

139
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,019
I need water in my reactor core!

140
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:42,563
Get down there and make
sure those pumps are on.

141
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,313
Now!

142
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,217
What does the dosimeter say?

143
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,477
3.6 roentgen, but that's
as high as the meter...

144
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,229
3.6... not great, not terrible.

145
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,354
We did everything right.

146
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,021
You, connect those hooks!

147
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,413
Get the pumps going!

148
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,666
Yeah, over here!

149
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:11,563
We're working bottom to top. Go in fast.

150
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:33,984
Vasily...

151
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:38,185
- Hey, Vasily, what's this?
- I don't know, Misha.

152
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,688
Don't fuck around with
it. Hook these up, come on.

153
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:47,811
Do you taste metal?

154
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:51,021
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

155
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,498
The valves, Misha! The valves, let's go!

156
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:56,021
The valves! Come on!

157
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,644
What do you need?

158
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,977
We need to get into the reactor hall

159
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,396
to lower the control rods,
but the door is jammed.

160
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,686
I don't think there are control rods.

161
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,354
I don't think there's a core.

162
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,396
No, you're... You're mistaken.

163
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,646
Akimov said.

164
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,396
Let's go.

165
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,060
No!

166
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:22,894
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

167
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,811
It's all right. Breathe.

168
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,561
Misha.

169
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:28,563
All right, all right. Easy, Misha.

170
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,271
Are you sure?

171
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,062
Akimov...

172
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:24,979
Move.

173
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:36,979
Come on, go!

174
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:17,626
Let's go!

175
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,021
Let's go!

176
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:21,758
Hey!

177
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:29,894
Hey!

178
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,728
Lyudmilla! Do
you want to come with us?

179
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,946
Come where?

180
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:56,269
We're going to the railroad
bridge to get a better look.

181
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,728
It's not like anyone can
sleep with all the sirens.

182
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,123
I don't think you should
go. It could be dangerous.

183
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:04,227
What do you mean dangerous? It's a
fire. It's over there, we're over here.

184
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,855
- Mikhail.
- What?

185
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:09,272
Oh, sorry.

186
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,858
Oh.

187
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,394
- Is Vasily...?
- Yeah.

188
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,060
Did he say it was bad?

189
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:19,899
No. No, he said it was just the roof.

190
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,476
Well, he's never gotten hurt before.

191
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,104
None of the boys have.

192
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,690
He'll be fine.

193
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:28,563
Get some rest.

194
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,102
The tank, it's big enough.

195
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:46,436
This kind of explosion, the control
tank on 71, it's 100 cubic meters.

196
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:47,853
One hundred and ten.

197
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:50,686
Hundred and ten. It
could do this, definitely.

198
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:54,102
It's gone.

199
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:56,269
I looked right into it.

200
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:57,979
I looked into the core.

201
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,935
Did you lower the control rods or not?

202
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,771
Take him to the infirmary.

203
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:09,979
Toptunov, take him!

204
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:17,185
- Where's Kudryavstev?
- He fell.

205
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,311
- I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

206
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,811
- His face...
- Ruptured condenser lines.

207
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,811
The feedwater is mildly contaminated.

208
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,561
He'll be fine. I've seen worse.

209
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:28,979
Do we still have a phone
line to the outside?

210
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:33,603
Akimov?

211
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,646
Call in the day shift.

212
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:39,475
- But if the...
- We have to keep water flowing into the core.

213
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:42,646
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

214
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:46,021
How many times do I have to say it?

215
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,185
I'm going to the
Administration Building now

216
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:58,811
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

217
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,229
They're gonna want a full report.

218
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:06,185
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you,

219
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:09,021
but I can certainly make them worse.

220
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,646
Call in the day shift, Comrade Akimov.

221
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,714
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

222
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:54,368
You're doing fine.

223
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:56,288
Raise her up.

224
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:01,394
That one, maybe an hour.

225
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,563
This one, not until morning.

226
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:09,685
- How's it downstairs, doctor?
- Quiet.

227
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,477
Always is.

228
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,229
Nothing at this hour but babies.

229
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:18,060
You know, I once went
two days without sleep?

230
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:20,769
Ten women went into
labor at the same time.

231
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,146
- Did I ever tell you that story?
- Yes.

232
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,102
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

233
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:29,896
If you want, get some
rest in the break room.

234
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:33,019
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

235
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:36,104
- What fire?
- The power plant.

236
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,771
Oh. Then it mustn't be too bad.

237
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,673
Do we stock iodine?

238
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,592
- Hmm?
- Iodine.

239
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,326
You mean disinfectant?

240
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,143
No, pills. Does the
hospital stock iodine pills?

241
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:53,104
Iodine pills? Why would
we have iodine pills?

242
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,605
Hello?

243
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:10,104
Hello?

244
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,950
Who else knows this?

245
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:22,688
Have you called Fomin?

246
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,977
Of course I want you to call him.

247
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:28,187
If I'm up, he's up.

248
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,519
Whatever the cause,
the important thing is

249
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,229
that neither you nor I...

250
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:53,436
I take it the safety test was a failure?

251
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,769
- We have the situation under control.
- Under control?

252
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:59,563
- It doesn't look like it's under control.
- Shut up, Fomin.

253
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,795
I have to tell the Central Committee
about this. Do you realize that?

254
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:05,977
I have to get on the
phone and tell Maryin,

255
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,519
or God forbid Frolyshev,

256
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,311
that my power plant is on fire.

257
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,811
No one can blame you for
this, Director Bryukhanov.

258
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,603
Of course no one can blame me for this.

259
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,771
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

260
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,937
Tell me what happened, quickly.

261
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:25,185
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

262
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,162
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

263
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,173
encountered technical
difficulties leading

264
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,852
to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

265
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:35,477
It regrettably ignited,

266
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,104
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

267
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,311
The tank is quite large.

268
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,436
It's the only logical explanation.

269
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:47,977
Of course, Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

270
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:50,686
was directly supervising the test,

271
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,048
so he would know best.

272
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:54,479
A hydrogen tank, fire...

273
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:58,644
- Reactor?
- We're taking measures to ensure

274
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:01,144
a steady flow of water through the core.

275
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:04,185
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here it's nothing.

276
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:06,977
But in the reactor
building, I'm being told

277
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,102
3.6 roentgen per hour.

278
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:11,352
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

279
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,019
Not at all.

280
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:16,144
- From the feedwater, I assume?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:18,519
We'll have to limit shifts

282
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,686
to six hours at a time, but otherwise...

283
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:23,271
The dosimetrists should
be checking regularly.

284
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:28,062
Have them use the good
meter from the safe.

285
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:32,235
Right. I'll call Maryin.

286
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,603
Have them wake up the
local executive committee.

287
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,853
There'll be orders coming down.

288
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:45,060
- Here.
- No.

289
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:47,688
You sure? Okay.

290
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,354
- What do you think makes the colors?
- Oh...

291
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:57,477
- It's the fuel for sure.
- "Oh. It's the fuel for sure"?

292
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,977
What do you know about it? You
clean floors at a train station.

293
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:02,769
My friend, Yuri, works
at the power plant.

294
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,436
He says it runs cold.

295
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:06,623
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

296
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:09,732
Yuri says the only thing is, you
can't walk right up to the fuel.

297
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:12,519
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

298
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:15,519
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

299
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,937
At the nuclear power plant, yeah.

300
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,062
It is beautiful.

301
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:28,730
Yeah.

302
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:22,173
Do you have a cigarette?

303
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:49,646
Do you need help?

304
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,730
It's over.

305
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:03,603
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

306
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:06,438
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

307
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:15,771
Vasily! You've gotta put it out.

308
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:22,187
That's enough,
comrades. We're pushing ahead.

309
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,726
Come on, boys.

310
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,561
Vasily, it's just past, straight up.

311
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,479
All the way up, all the way in.

312
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,021
Come on!

313
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,313
Yeah. Going in now.

314
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,811
What about the auxiliary?

315
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,311
The pumps are gone, electrical's gone.

316
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:54,229
- The core?
- I didn't go in there, and I won't.

317
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,561
- I think it's time we faced...
- No, we have to get water into the core.

318
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:00,394
Otherwise, there'll be a meltdown.

319
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,394
We have to open the valves.

320
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,509
- Sasha...
- What do you want, Boris?

321
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:06,561
If it's true, then we're dead,
a million people are dead.

322
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,730
Is that what you need to hear?

323
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:12,227
We have to open the valves.

324
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:14,436
- By hand.
- By hand?

325
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,060
You know, the number of valves,
the amount of time to turn them,

326
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:18,769
you're talking about hours in there!

327
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,568
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

328
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:23,730
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

329
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,896
Leonid, I'm begging you.

330
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,019
Watch the panel while we're gone.

331
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,479
It's not working.

332
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:54,396
Just watch it.

333
00:37:16,062 --> 00:37:18,232
I guess we know
why they called us in early.

334
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,644
Is anyone
saying what happened?

335
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:22,977
They were running the
safety test on the turbines,

336
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,104
blew the control system tank.

337
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,646
It doesn't make sense to me either.

338
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,454
What about sabotage?

339
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,998
A bomb?

340
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,560
Sitnikov! Bryukhanov wants
us to use the good dosimeter,

341
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,436
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

342
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:43,853
It's in Building 2. Hasn't...?

343
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:45,521
Follow me.

344
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:58,518
Gentlemen, welcome.

345
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:01,769
Please, uh, find a seat. Plenty of room.

346
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,352
I apologize for the
lateness of the hour.

347
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:09,519
Rest assured, we are
all very safe down here.

348
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,269
We built this shelter to
withstand a nuclear attack

349
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:15,563
by the Americans, so
I think we'll be fine.

350
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:19,686
As you can see, we have
experienced an accident.

351
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:22,352
A large control tank malfunctioned,

352
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:26,311
damaging reactor Building
4 and starting a fire.

353
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:30,060
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

354
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:32,394
Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

355
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:35,686
Frolyshev to Central
Committee member Dolgikh,

356
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,209
and Dolgikh to General
Secretary Gorbachev.

357
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:40,977
Now...

358
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:46,311
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

359
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:50,352
for the work of the
Pripyat Executive Committee,

360
00:38:50,354 --> 00:38:54,354
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

361
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:59,727
- First, the accident...
- is well under control.

362
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:05,060
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

363
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:08,853
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

364
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:12,269
that we ensure that this incident

365
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:14,436
has no adverse consequences.

366
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:18,644
Now, to prevent a panic, the
Central Committee have ordered

367
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:21,603
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

368
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,438
How large of a detachment?

369
00:39:24,855 --> 00:39:26,977
Between two and four thousand men.

370
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:33,019
What's really going on
here? How dangerous is this?

371
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:37,102
There's mild radiation, but
it's limited to the plant itself.

372
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:40,269
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

373
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:44,269
You saw men outside vomiting.

374
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:46,104
You saw men with burns.

375
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,644
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

376
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:52,019
We have wives here, we have children.

377
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:54,811
I say we evacuate the town.

378
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,644
Gentlemen...

379
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:00,808
Please, please. My wife is here.

380
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,934
Do you think I would keep her in Pripyat

381
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:04,476
if it wasn't safe?

382
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:08,185
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

383
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:11,399
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

384
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:13,269
It can happen with minimal radiation.

385
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:27,646
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

386
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:33,477
We all call it "Chernobyl," of course.

387
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:35,813
What is its real name?

388
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:40,930
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

389
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:42,855
Exactly.

390
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:48,855
Vladimir I. Lenin.

391
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:59,688
And how proud he would
be of you all tonight.

392
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,021
Especially you, young man,

393
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,896
and the passion you have for the people.

394
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:11,896
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

395
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:15,646
Sometimes, we forget.

396
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:19,521
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

397
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,018
But our faith in Soviet socialism

398
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:27,937
will always be rewarded.

399
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,686
Now, the State tells us the
situation here is not dangerous.

400
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,229
Have faith, comrades.

401
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:42,230
The State tells us it
wants to prevent a panic.

402
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,442
Listen well.

403
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:51,271
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

404
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:54,730
But it is my experience

405
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,060
that when the people ask questions

406
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:01,436
that are not in their own best interest,

407
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,436
they should simply be told

408
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,605
to keep their minds on their labor

409
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:11,479
and leave matters of
the State to the State.

410
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:15,229
We seal off the city.

411
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,062
No one leaves.

412
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,977
And cut the phone lines.

413
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:23,771
Contain the spread of misinformation.

414
00:42:26,438 --> 00:42:29,311
That is how we keep the people

415
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,479
from undermining the
fruits of their own labor.

416
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:37,313
Yes, comrades...

417
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:42,646
we will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

418
00:42:44,986 --> 00:42:49,486
This is our moment to shine.

419
00:43:01,638 --> 00:43:02,855
Thank you.

420
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:18,313
Comrade Sitnikov to
see the Chief Engineer.

421
00:43:31,187 --> 00:43:32,354
Well?

422
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:42,187
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

423
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,060
The large dosimeter from the safe,

424
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:46,977
the one with the
1,000-roentgen capacity...

425
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:48,313
What was the number?

426
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:52,853
There was none.

427
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:55,730
The meter burned out the
second it was turned on.

428
00:43:56,563 --> 00:43:58,705
- It's typical.
- See? This is what Moscow does.

429
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,728
Sends us shit equipment, then
wonders why things go wrong.

430
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,019
We found another dosimeter

431
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,060
from the military fire department.

432
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:09,102
It only goes to 200 roentgen, but
it's better than the small ones.

433
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,220
And?

434
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,436
It maxed out.

435
00:44:13,438 --> 00:44:15,021
Two hundred roentgen.

436
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,685
What game are you playing?

437
00:44:19,688 --> 00:44:21,185
No, I... I...

438
00:44:21,187 --> 00:44:24,894
I asked him, he took multiple
measurements, he's my best man.

439
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,644
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

440
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:29,477
I checked the meter against the control.

441
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:31,811
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

442
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:34,062
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

443
00:44:37,563 --> 00:44:41,104
- You don't.
- Then what the fuck are you talking about?

444
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:47,104
I, um...

445
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:52,438
I walked around the
exterior of Building 4.

446
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:56,937
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

447
00:44:57,937 --> 00:44:59,730
You didn't see graphite.

448
00:45:00,537 --> 00:45:02,454
- I did.
- You didn't.

449
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:07,271
You didn't! Because it's not there!

450
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:09,853
What?

451
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:13,436
Are you suggesting the core... what?

452
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:15,605
Exploded?

453
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:18,605
Yes.

454
00:45:27,021 --> 00:45:28,313
Sitnikov.

455
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,185
You're a nuclear engineer, so am I.

456
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:38,477
Please tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

457
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:42,227
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

458
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:43,987
I'd love to know.

459
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,260
I can't.

460
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:48,729
Are you stupid?

461
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:52,771
- No.
- Then why can't you?

462
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:55,688
I...

463
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:00,271
I don't see how it could explode.

464
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:04,663
- But it did.
- Enough!

465
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,352
I'll go up to the vent block roof.

466
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:09,811
From there you can look right
down into reactor Building 4.

467
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:13,561
I'll see it with my own... my own eyes.

468
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:21,211
I apologize.

469
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,563
Guards! Guards!

470
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:28,855
Get him to the medic or the
hospital! Whatever he needs!

471
00:46:44,937 --> 00:46:48,187
It's the feedwater.
Been around it all night.

472
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:51,896
You go then.

473
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,477
What?

474
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:59,473
Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.

475
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:00,569
No.

476
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:08,271
- No, I won't do that.
- Of course you will.

477
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:16,503
You'll be fine. You'll see.

478
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,492
Come on.

479
00:48:00,896 --> 00:48:02,271
Okay.

480
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:05,320
Let's begin.

481
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,849
Leonid.

482
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:19,942
Leonid.

483
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:22,479
Oh...

484
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,644
It's all the way, okay?

485
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:32,772
All the way open.

486
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:42,813
I'm sorry.

487
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,810
There's nothing to be sorry for.

488
00:48:48,813 --> 00:48:52,146
I told you, we did nothing wrong.

489
00:48:54,688 --> 00:48:56,187
But we did.

490
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,328
Hello?

491
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:47,268
- Valery Legasov?
- Yes.

492
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:49,894
You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director

493
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:52,477
of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy?

494
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:55,060
- I am. Who am I...?
- This is Boris Shcherbina,

495
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,144
Deputy Chairman of the
Council of Ministers

496
00:52:57,146 --> 00:52:59,853
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

497
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:04,686
There's been an accident at the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

498
00:53:04,688 --> 00:53:05,935
How bad is it?

499
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:08,185
No. No need to panic. There was a fire.

500
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:11,400
It's mostly put out. The
system control tank exploded.

501
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:14,853
Control system tank. And the core?

502
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:18,102
We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.

503
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,853
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

504
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:23,769
It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting

505
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:25,352
3.6 roentgen per hour.

506
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:27,603
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the sur...

507
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:32,102
You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?

508
00:53:32,105 --> 00:53:33,689
Yes, I've studied...

509
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:36,394
General Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

510
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:40,102
to manage the accident. You're on it.

511
00:53:40,104 --> 00:53:42,352
We'll convene at two this afternoon.

512
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:45,519
That late? Forgive
me, but don't you think

513
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:47,352
given the amount of
radiation that it would be...

514
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:50,658
Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions

515
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:53,144
about the function of an RBMK reactor

516
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,185
if they should happen
to arise. Nothing else.

517
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:58,977
Certainly not policy. Do you understand?

518
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:01,977
Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...

519
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:17,268
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

520
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:53,935
I'm pleased to report that

521
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:56,097
the situation in Chernobyl is stable.

522
00:58:57,995 --> 00:58:59,561
In terms of radiation,

523
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:02,378
I'm told it's the
equivalent of a chest X-ray.

524
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:06,769
No!

525
00:59:06,771 --> 00:59:09,185
The fire is giving off
nearly twice the radiation

526
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:10,979
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

527
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:13,644
It will burn and spread its poison

528
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:16,269
until the entire continent is dead.

529
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:22,573
Tell our soldiers,

530
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:24,227
"You will need to move quickly,

531
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,021
and you will need to move carefully.

532
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,688
These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.

533
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,688
I wish you good health and long life."

534
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:37,956
I serve the Soviet Union.

535
00:59:38,062 --> 00:59:39,730
I serve the Soviet Union.

536
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:42,104
I serve the Soviet Union.

537
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:53,401
The official position of the state

538
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:55,769
is that a global nuclear catastrophe

539
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:57,771
is not possible in the Soviet Union.
