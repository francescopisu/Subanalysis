1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:03,680
Where are you going?

2
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:05,828
Chernobyl.

3
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:13,117
Ignatenko, fire and rescue
unit. I need to find him!

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,326
Moscow.
Hospital number six.

5
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:17,534
Are you here because of the fire?

6
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,370
Anything we should be worried about?

7
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:21,328
No.

8
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:24,828
It cannot go over the core.

9
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:32,451
The nuclear plant
in Sweden has detected radiation.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,536
At least evacuate Pripyat.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,368
When the lava enters these tanks,

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,951
it will instantly superheat,

13
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:42,660
causing a significant thermal explosion.

14
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,368
And how long before this happens?

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,618
Approximately 48 to 72 hours,

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,743
but we may have a solution.

17
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:07,867

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

18
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,018
Is it possible that the
water has already killed them?

19
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,043
Yes.

20
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,746
Then what?

21
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,125
If it doesn't work?

22
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,117
Get them in the truck.

23
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,519
Get the hoses in! Start pumping!

24
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:25,677
Uh, I'm here to see my
husband, Vasily Ignatenko.

25
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,442
He's a firefighter from
Chernobyl. I have permission.

26
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:31,244
Chernobyl? I'm sorry, no visitors.

27
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:35,648
Well, but Major Burov told me,

28
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,082
- he said...
- No exceptions.

29
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,918
Please. I've come all the
way from Kievskaya Oblast.

30
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,579
Excuse me.

31
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,388
Excuse me, excuse me.

32
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,916
Who are you? What are you doing here?

33
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,686
- I have a pass.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

34
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,353
I am here to see my husband.

35
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,689
Vasily Ignatenko.

36
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,323
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.

37
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,993
I know who Ignatenko is, but you can't.

38
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,128
I have permission. I-I've...

39
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:33,552
You can see him for 30
minutes, not a minute more.

40
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,640
And you cannot touch him in
any way. Do you understand?

41
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,576
- Yeah.
- Room 15.

42
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,279
Thank you.

43
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,281
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- No.

44
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,790
I won't have to give that to you.

45
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,125
There they are.

46
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,027
No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

47
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:58,429
No, he hasn't.

48
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,364
Yeah, that's good.

49
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,768
Yeah, better.

50
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,306
Look who the cat dragged in.

51
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:13,110
What did I tell you?

52
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:17,013
There's no hiding from you, is there?

53
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,818
Easy, easy. It's okay.

54
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,222
We're all okay. Yeah, we're okay.

55
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,660
How, how, how did this
happen? Who gave them the idea?

56
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,662
- Are you suggesting I did?
- Someone did.

57
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:44,165
Someone decided that the evacuation zone

58
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,690
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

59
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,427
Cesium-137 in the Gomel district.

60
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,897
- That's 200 kilometers away!
- It was decided.

61
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,243
- Based on what?
- I don't know!

62
00:08:56,347 --> 00:09:00,481
Forgive me. Maybe I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

63
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,350
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

64
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,619
Is this really the way it all works?

65
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,588
An uninformed, arbitrary decision

66
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,923
that will cost who knows how many lives

67
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:13,994
made by some apparatchik,
some career party man?

68
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,399
I'm a career party man.

69
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,135
You should watch your
tone, Comrade Legasov.

70
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,049
Comrades...

71
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,874
We have visual confirmation that
the fire is nearly extinguished.

72
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,143
There has also been a
reduction in iodine 131

73
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,041
and cesium-137 emissions.

74
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,180
Good. Yes?

75
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:37,217
But the temperature is rising.

76
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:38,752
And, uh...

77
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,996
There's a spike in zirconium-95.

78
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,433
It's from the cladding on the fuel rods.

79
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:55,903
Meaning what?

80
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,538
The meltdown has begun.

81
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,610
Get it off me!

82
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,582
Get it off me!

83
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,424
Stop moving!

84
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:55,193
Get off him! You're hurting him!

85
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,063
- You can't be in here.
- What's happening to him?

86
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,884
Get out!

87
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,728
You can't be in here!

88
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,702
Yes?

89
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,311
<i>Comrade Shcherbina is on the phone.</i>

90
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,812
Put him through.

91
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:51,448
Well?

92
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,150
<i>The fire's nearly out.</i>

93
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:54,986
The bubbler tanks are being drained.

94
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:58,153
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

95
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,358
And?

96
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,395
The situation inside the core

97
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,231
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

98
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:11,167
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

99
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,504
but after that, Legasov
estimates a 50% chance

100
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,672
that the fuel will breach the pad

101
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:19,142
and melt down into
the groundwater itself.

102
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:22,478
And where
does this groundwater go?

103
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,580
The Pripyat River,

104
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:27,517
which feeds into the Dnieper.

105
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,153
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

106
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:33,022
not to mention crops and livestock,

107
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:35,157
would be... unusable.

108
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,093
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

109
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,196
to lower to core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

110
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,367
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need...

111
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:50,873
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

112
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,976
<i>Oh.</i>

113
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:57,713
- <i>All right.</i>
- Yeah, and of course, we'll also need...

114
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,314
<i>Whatever you need, you have it.</i>

115
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:00,783
- <i>That should be clear by now.</i>
- Yes.

116
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,416
- <i>Anything else?</i>
- No, no, no. Thank you.

117
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:05,386
Yes. I'd like to address the
30-kilometer exclusion zone.

118
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:08,590
Wait, what? Professor
Legasov, is that you?

119
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,657
What exclusion zone?

120
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,859
Minor details, General Secretary.

121
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:14,462
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that...

122
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,834
<i>If he determined, then he determined.</i>

123
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,365
<i>Look, Professor Legasov,</i>

124
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,468
<i>you are there for one reason only.</i>

125
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,604
<i>Do you understand? To make this stop.</i>

126
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:24,005
I don't want questions.

127
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,807
I want to know when this will be over.

128
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,042
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

129
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,245
the half-life of
plutonium-239 is 24,000 years.

130
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:34,548
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

131
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,762
I think you and I should take a walk.

132
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,897
It's late. I'm tired.

133
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,434
We're taking a walk.

134
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,476
Was it it you want? An apology?

135
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,546
Not gonna sit back and...

136
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,651
What will happen to our boys?

137
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,053
Which boys? The divers?

138
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:17,457
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

139
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,127
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

140
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:25,431
At the levels some of them were exposed?

141
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:29,335
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

142
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:33,005
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

143
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,842
This is followed by a latency period.

144
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,745
The immediate effects subside.

145
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,882
The patient appears to be recovering.

146
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,350
Healthy, even. But they aren't.

147
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:50,489
This usually only
lasts for a day or two.

148
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,160
Continue.

149
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:59,031
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

150
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:04,469
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

151
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:08,273
the organs and soft
tissue begin to decompose.

152
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:12,377
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

153
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,914
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

154
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,250
for the pain, which is... unimaginable.

155
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,854
And then three days to
three weeks, you are dead.

156
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,525
That is what will happen to those boys.

157
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,162
And what about us?

158
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,034
Well, we've...

159
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,304
We've gotten a steady
dose, but not as much of it.

160
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,440
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

161
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,543
but consistent enough to damage our DNA.

162
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,248
So, in time... cancer.

163
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,551
Or aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

164
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,888
Well...

165
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:05,396
in a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

166
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,943
I've seen them before.

167
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,985
Now you know why I
wanted to take a walk.

168
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,488
We can presume the work site is bugged.

169
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,125
And our rooms, even our bathrooms.

170
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,662
They've been here the whole time.

171
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,797
Of course they've been
here the whole time.

172
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,635
But if we're seeing
them out in the open now,

173
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,571
it's because they want us to know.

174
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,813
You've seen that?

175
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:36,183
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

176
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:39,320
I know. I have a plan.

177
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:42,056
Heat exchanger, I hope.

178
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:43,591
Yes.

179
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,595
There's something I've
wanted to ask you, comrade,

180
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,999
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

181
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,373
Why did it explode?

182
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,109
I've worked the numbers over and over,

183
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,045
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

184
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,384
And I always get the same answer.

185
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:11,951
Which is?

186
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,589
It's not possible.

187
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,156
And yet...

188
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,496
You're not going to solve this here.

189
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,632
Not on paper.

190
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:29,035
Everyone who was in the control room,

191
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:31,438
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

192
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,609
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

193
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:38,878
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

194
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,548
moment by moment, decision by decision.

195
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:46,051
Go now while they're still alive.

196
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,020
Talk to them.

197
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,989
Because if we don't find
out how this happened,

198
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,392
it will happen again.

199
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,653
And, Khomyuk...

200
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:00,715
be careful.

201
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,092
Well, fuck you!

202
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:32,197
Hey, here's one, here's one.

203
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,232
What's as big as a house,

204
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:37,169
burns 20 liters of fuel every hour,

205
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,348
puts out a shit-load
of smoke and noise,

206
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,141
<i>and cuts an apple into three pieces?</i>

207
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:48,612
A Soviet machine made to
cut apples into four pieces!

208
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:31,121
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

209
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:35,225
I am Shadov, minister
of coal industries.

210
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,926
We know who you are.

211
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,530
How many men do you have?

212
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:45,135
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

213
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:49,205
I need all 100 men to gather their
equipment and get in the trucks.

214
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,775
Do you? To where?

215
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,610
That's classified.

216
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,118
Come on, then.

217
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,819
Start shooting.

218
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:08,157
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

219
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,225
Kill as many as you can, whoever's left,

220
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,271
they'll beat the living
piss out of each of you.

221
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:15,564
- You can't talk to us like that!
- Shut the fuck up!

222
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,500
This is Tula. This is our mine.

223
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,537
We don't leave unless we know why.

224
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,588
Mm.

225
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,645
You're going to Chernobyl.

226
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:35,116
Do you know what's happened there?

227
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,418
We dig up coal, not bodies.

228
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,689
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

229
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:43,877
and poison the water from
Kiev to the Black Sea.

230
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,413
All of it.

231
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:48,063
Forever, they say.

232
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,234
They want you to stop
that from happening.

233
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:55,604
And how are we supposed to do that?

234
00:21:56,907 --> 00:22:00,274
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

235
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,245
Do you need to know, or
have you heard enough?

236
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,121
Now you look like the minister of coal.

237
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:11,110
Vasya?

238
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:13,912
Vasya?

239
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
No, no, no.

240
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,289
They told you no touching.

241
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,558
It's not safe.

242
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,960
They touch you.

243
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:32,097
If it's safe for them, it's safe for me.

244
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,042
Where are the others?

245
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,611
They took them to a special room.

246
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,347
They won't tell me where.

247
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,120
Will you open the curtains?

248
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:59,490
- Hmm?
- Open the curtains.

249
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,596
Aah.

250
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,481
Please, tell me what you see outside.

251
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,083
Tell me everything.

252
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:34,992
Huh.

253
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,695
I can see the Red Square.

254
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,500
And...

255
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,269
the Kremlin.

256
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:49,974
Spasskaya Tower, the Mausoleum.

257
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:54,845
You see St. Basil's?

258
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah.

259
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:59,015
Ah.

260
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:00,850
Yes, it's beautiful.

261
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,321
I told you.

262
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:07,724
I told you I'd show
you Moscow, remember?

263
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,761
- Huh?
- Yeah. Yes.

264
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:18,402
Thank you.

265
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:08,384
I'm not eating that. It's shit.

266
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,419
Get me something else.

267
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:14,189
I'm not a nurse, Comrade Dyatlov.

268
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,191
I'm a nuclear physicist.

269
00:26:16,861 --> 00:26:19,562
Well, then, Comrade Nuclear Physicist...

270
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,333
unless you happen to have a
butter and caviar sandwich on you,

271
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:28,637
you can get the fuck out of my room.

272
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:47,748
What?

273
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:51,572
I'm not good at this, Boris.

274
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,408
The lying.

275
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:00,962
Have you ever spent time with miners?

276
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,897
No.

277
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:06,567
My advice: tell the truth.

278
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:10,271
These men work in the
dark. They see everything.

279
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:14,141
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

280
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,759
Do these work?

281
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:33,628
To an extent.

282
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,831
Of course.

283
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,811
So what's the job?

284
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:57,616
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

285
00:28:57,618 --> 00:29:00,785
underneath this concrete pad.

286
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:04,789
There's no way to approach from
the interior of the building,

287
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:07,292
so you have to get at
it from underground.

288
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:10,795
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

289
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:13,832
which is melting down.

290
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,468
What? Like...

291
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,238
Essentially.

292
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,441
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

293
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:24,475
Not if you're done within six weeks.

294
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:28,346
Dimensions?

295
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:33,284
Break ground here,

296
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,619
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

297
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:38,856
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

298
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:40,583
for the heat exchanger.

299
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:43,794
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

300
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,729
you can't use any heavy machinery.

301
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,198
It has to be done by hand.

302
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,567
Then I need more men.

303
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,403
Four hundred at least.

304
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,039
We'll have to work around the clock.

305
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,941
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

306
00:29:56,943 --> 00:29:59,976
- Twelve.
- Twelve? Why?

307
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,546
For your protection.

308
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:06,450
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

309
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:10,787
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

310
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,923
No.

311
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:17,026
And we're not 12
meters below ground now.

312
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,601
No. We're not.

313
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:29,761
We have some
equipment here on site.

314
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:32,609
More will arrive by midnight.

315
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,578
You can start in the morning.

316
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,213
No. We start now.

317
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:41,250
I don't want my men here one
more second than they need to be.

318
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:46,756
If these worked, you'd be wearing them.

319
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,400
Are they all like that?

320
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,837
They're all like that.

321
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,220
<i>Yes?</i>

322
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:28,856
- What's it up to?
<i>- Uh, 50 degrees.</i>

323
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,170
Fuck!

324
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,377
Hey!

325
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,812
Hey you!

326
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,448
- We need fans.
- For what purpose?

327
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,383
What do you mean, "For what purpose?"

328
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:58,184
To dig your fucking tunnel, that's why.

329
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:01,121
- Who's talking to you?
- Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

330
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:03,557
It's 50 degrees down there.

331
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,292
We can't breathe without the masks,

332
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:06,860
we can't breathe with the masks.

333
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:10,130
It's like a fucking
oven. We need ventilation.

334
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,966
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

335
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:15,702
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

336
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,438
- Not this dust.
- I'm sorry.

337
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,708
For your own good, no fans.

338
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,838
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

339
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,441
I'm a nuclear physicist with
the Chernobyl Commission.

340
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,411
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

341
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,579
on the night of the accident.

342
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:04,249
Is that all right?

343
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,046
Yes.

344
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:12,369
I want to tell.

345
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:13,971
All right.

346
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,142
Your official title was?

347
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:37,414
My name is Leonid Fedorovych Toptunov.

348
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:43,654
I am the senior reactor
control chief engineer

349
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,357
at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

350
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:52,363
Senior engineer?

351
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:56,133
How old are you?

352
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,907
I'm 25.

353
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:52,554
Lyusya? Lyusya?

354
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:55,057
Yes, I'm here, I'm here. I'm...

355
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:12,074
Have you been here this whole time?

356
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:14,776
No one said I should leave.

357
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:16,145
I did.

358
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,512
Thirty minutes, I said!

359
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:21,049
Well, where have you
been? When he's in pain?

360
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,383
When his sores stick to his gown?

361
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:24,085
When he soils himself
five times a night?

362
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,112
I've been looking after
him. Where have you been?

363
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,010
I've been In the north and west wing,

364
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:31,182
where there are dozens of patients
from Chernobyl exactly like him.

365
00:36:31,185 --> 00:36:33,261
- It isn't safe for you here.
- He's my husband.

366
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:34,395
Not anymore.

367
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:36,331
He's something else
now. Do you understand?

368
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,133
He's dangerous to you.

369
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:41,803
He's burned.

370
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:43,505
Go home.

371
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,674
Please.

372
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,646
It won't take much longer. I, uh...

373
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:58,086
I don't want him to die alone.

374
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:02,656
Stay on the other side of the plastic.

375
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,094
Or I'll have you removed by security.

376
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,521
- Lyusya?
- Yes, my love.

377
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:13,260
Is it day?

378
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:15,595
No, it's nighttime now.

379
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,468
I think I had a dream,

380
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,437
it's just gone.

381
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:26,673
Vasya.

382
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,381
We're going to have a baby.

383
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,585
The fire's out.

384
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,619
It's out, Valera.

385
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,526
The miners are making
incredible progress.

386
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:24,796
They say the whole job will
be finished in four weeks.

387
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Four weeks.

388
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:30,569
Can you believe that?

389
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,577
I know the job isn't over.

390
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,148
But it's the beginning of the end.

391
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:50,588
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister, but...

392
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:53,958
it is the miners.

393
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:43,440
What?

394
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,410
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

395
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:49,146
So we're digging the old way.
This is how our fathers mined.

396
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,982
We're still wearing the fucking hats.

397
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,851
What do you want?

398
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,624
You're not as protected now.

399
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,393
Are you telling me it
will make a difference?

400
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:10,734
When this is over,

401
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,736
will they be looked after?

402
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,041
I don't know.

403
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,519
You don't know.

404
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:54,343
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

405
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,212
Yes.

406
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,882
Very fast.

407
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:03,786
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

408
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,554
Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button?

409
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,424
We did.

410
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:13,095
I reported the increase to Akimov,

411
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,230
and he pressed the button.

412
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,668
Leonid, that's... that's not possible.

413
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,938
He did.

414
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,973
I s-swear.

415
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,176
I saw him do it.

416
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,015
And that's when it exploded.

417
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:37,136
What?

418
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,367
Um...

419
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,538
- Which room is Akimov?
- Twenty-seven.

420
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:15,288
I pressed it...
before the explosion.

421
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,057
Before.

422
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:21,829
But why?

423
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,930
Why would that happen?

424
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:28,836
I shut it down. I pressed AZ-5.

425
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:36,577
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

426
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,450
I did everything right.

427
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:47,020
I did everything right.

428
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:19,619
Get out.

429
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:21,253
Get out. Get out of here.

430
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:23,656
Let me go! Let me go!

431
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:26,292
Stop it! Stop it!

432
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,678
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

433
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,408
- Did you know she's pregnant?
- It's not true!

434
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,576
What have you done?

435
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,118
What kind of place is this?
Where is her protection?

436
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:40,908
- Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
- Of course I do.

437
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,575
- Please, I do not...
- No.

438
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:44,877
- People are going to hear about this.
- Wait.

439
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,679
People are going to
hear. Do you understand?

440
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:48,681
Everyone is going to hear.

441
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:50,816
What is everyone gonna hear?

442
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,857
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

443
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,426
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

444
00:45:01,428 --> 00:45:04,362
- You can check this. My name is Ulana...
- We know who you are.

445
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:10,025
What is everyone gonna hear?

446
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:32,424
You have your notes?

447
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:34,026
Yes.

448
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:38,295
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

449
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:40,798
What? Why?

450
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,334
I don't know.

451
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:47,070
- Was it...?
- Of course it was.

452
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:49,640
I'm working on it.

453
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:52,543
- Boris...
- I'm working on it.

454
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,913
What more do you want from me?

455
00:45:55,915 --> 00:45:57,481
Fix your tie.

456
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,422
They'll see you now.

457
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:19,102
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

458
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:20,907
successfully extinguished the fire.

459
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,306
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

460
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,509
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

461
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:27,710
And furthermore, there is no longer

462
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:29,712
a threat of additional explosion.

463
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:34,617
The Soviet people have faced the
challenge and risen to the task,

464
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,953
and they and everyone in
this room are to be commended.

465
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,794
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

466
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:47,263
to protect the security
interests of the State.

467
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,933
And since the unfortunate
release of information

468
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,300
directly following the accident,

469
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:54,336
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

470
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:56,873
Comrade Charkov,

471
00:46:56,875 --> 00:47:00,910
we hope we have lived up to the
highest standards of the KGB.

472
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,044
You have.

473
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:03,779
Thank you.

474
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:08,284
Professor Legasov will now speak about

475
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:09,818
the work that remains.

476
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,426
Thank you.

477
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:19,995
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

478
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:22,030
and it is good.

479
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,633
The immediate danger is over.

480
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:27,836
Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.

481
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:31,740
There is an enormous
amount of radioactive debris

482
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:33,942
and contamination
spread out across a zone

483
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:36,478
of approximately 2600 square kilometers.

484
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,949
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

485
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,121
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

486
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:52,059
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

487
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:55,096
whether domesticated or wild,

488
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:59,100
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

489
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:02,537
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

490
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,040
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

491
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:11,612
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

492
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:15,883
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

493
00:48:15,885 --> 00:48:18,653
which will be carried by the
wind and the rain if left exposed.

494
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:21,088
So we will have to raze entire forests.

495
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,223
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

496
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:24,625
and bury it under itself,

497
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:28,195
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

498
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:33,267
Um, and finally, we
will need to construct

499
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:38,305
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

500
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:41,909
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

501
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:46,480
There will be deaths.

502
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:51,652
What amount of time,

503
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:53,320
and how many men do you require?

504
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:57,191
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

505
00:48:57,193 --> 00:48:59,560
and approximately 750,000 men,

506
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:05,065
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

507
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,634
How many deaths?

508
00:49:07,636 --> 00:49:09,636
Thousands.

509
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:12,239
Perhaps tens of thousands.

510
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:21,347
Begin at once.

511
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,214
- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!

512
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:32,391
Yes, Professor?

513
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:36,295
My associate was arrested last night.

514
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:37,597
Oh?

515
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:41,935
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

516
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,303
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

517
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:47,173
She was arrested by the KGB.

518
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:50,309
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

519
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:51,842
I am.

520
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:54,813
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

521
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:57,316
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

522
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:01,120
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

523
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,289
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

524
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,360
Comrade, I know you've
heard the stories about us.

525
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:09,762
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

526
00:50:09,764 --> 00:50:11,764
But we are not what people say.

527
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:14,600
Yes, people are following you.

528
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:17,102
People are following those people.

529
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,437
You see them?

530
00:50:20,742 --> 00:50:22,575
They follow me.

531
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:26,745
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

532
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,046
Nothing more.

533
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:30,515
You know the work we're doing here.

534
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:34,586
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

535
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:37,634
But you know the old Russian proverb:

536
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:39,737
"Trust but verify."

537
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:45,530
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

538
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:46,965
Can you imagine?

539
00:50:47,968 --> 00:50:50,535
It was very nice speaking with you.

540
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:52,204
I need her.

541
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,375
So you will be accountable for her?

542
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:03,515
Then it's done.

543
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:07,419
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

544
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,321
Good day, Professor.

545
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:22,567
No, that went surprisingly well.

546
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:24,803
You came off like a naive idiot.

547
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:28,973
And naive idiots are not a threat.

548
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:47,157
I'll come back when
the paperwork is complete.

549
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,735
- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

550
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:02,038
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

551
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,275
It doesn't matter.

552
00:52:05,277 --> 00:52:08,011
They were stupid. I was stupid.

553
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,447
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

554
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,252
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

555
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:18,988
Valery,

556
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,556
Akimov...

557
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:23,459
his face was gone.

558
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,897
You want to stop?

559
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:32,234
Is that a choice I even have?

560
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:43,812
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

561
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:47,416
I don't know. A 40% chance maybe.

562
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:52,721
I said 50.

563
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:55,089
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

564
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,225
"Maybe."

565
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:02,397
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

566
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,866
Maybe the miners who I've
told to dig under the reactor

567
00:53:04,868 --> 00:53:07,335
will save millions of lives.

568
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:11,072
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

569
00:53:14,878 --> 00:53:16,978
I don't want to do this anymore.

570
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:19,981
I want to stop.

571
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:23,184
But I can't.

572
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:27,455
I don't think you have a
choice any more than I do.

573
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:32,193
I think, despite the stupidity,

574
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:34,687
the lies, even this...

575
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,156
you are compelled.

576
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:39,700
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

577
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:41,202
until you find an answer.

578
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:44,472
Because that is who you are.

579
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,176
A lunatic, then.

580
00:53:49,946 --> 00:53:52,246
A scientist.

581
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:16,169
Did you know that they
were running a safety test?

582
00:54:17,306 --> 00:54:20,140
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

583
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:24,678
Akimov says they shut the reactor down,

584
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,080
and Toptunov confirms it.

585
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:30,808
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

586
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,410
No.

587
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:37,116
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

588
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,820
and then the reactor exploded.

589
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:44,331
If it had been just one of
them, I would have put it under

590
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,699
faulty memory or delusion even,

591
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:50,570
but they both agreed. They were adamant.

592
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,576
Comrade?

593
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,682
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

594
00:55:02,684 --> 00:55:05,885
I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.

595
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,520
But?

596
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,389
I believed them.

597
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:13,993
Then you should pursue it.

598
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:18,064
We have to pursue every possibility,

599
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,700
no matter how unlikely,

600
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:23,770
no matter what or who's to blame.

601
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,542
I'll go back to the hospital and
reinterview Akimov and Toptunov.

602
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:33,813
If they're still awake.

603
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,540
They're not.

604
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:39,774
Khomyuk.

606
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:04,656
To hell with our lives.

607
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,218
Someone has to start telling the truth.

608
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,731
You think the right
question will get you the truth?

609
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:14,062
I know they're listening!

610
01:03:14,065 --> 01:03:16,298
There is no truth.
