1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,054
What is the cost of lies?

2
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:05,217
Who is to blame?

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,484
It doesn't matter.

4
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:12,945
It doesn't look right.

5
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,986
We taste metal.

6
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,778
I think there's
graphite on the ground.

7
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:21,878
You didn't see graphite.

8
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:25,706
You didn't
because it's not there!

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,734
We seal off the city. Contain
the spread of misinformation.

10
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:45,818
Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,292
to manage the accident. You're on it.

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,544

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

13
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,444
You work too hard.

14
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:41,270
- Where is everyone?
- Oh, they refused to come in.

15
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:43,774
- Why?
- It's Saturday.

16
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,484
- Why did you come in?
- I work too hard.

17
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,277
It's boiling in here.

18
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,410
Eight milliroentgen. A leak?

19
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:09,663
No.

20
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,484
It would've gone off before.
It's coming from outside.

21
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,111
The Americans?

22
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,442
Iodine 131.

23
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:02,359
It's not military. It's
uranium decay, U-235.

24
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,861
Reactor fuel?

25
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:10,109
Ignalina. Maybe, uh,
240 kilometers away.

26
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,693
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk

27
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,275
with the Institute of Nuclear En...

28
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:25,025
Looking for...?

29
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,234
- All right, stay calm.
- Don't tell me to stay calm.

30
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,901
They're at four. It's not them.

31
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,829
- Who's the next closest?
- It's Chernobyl, but that's not possible.

32
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,359
They're 400 kilometers away.

33
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,567
That's too far for eight milliroentgen.

34
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,275
They'd have to be split open.

35
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,484
Maybe they know something.

36
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,776
- Iodine.
- Could it be a waste dump?

37
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,234
No.

38
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,693
We'd be seeing other isotopes.

39
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:07,056
Nuclear test? Uh, new kind of bomb?

40
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:10,194
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

41
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:16,484
Something with the space
program like a satellite or...?

42
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,403
No one's answering the phone.

43
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:43,317
- Get everyone started on an IV.
- We don't have enough.

44
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,401
- All the children then.
- But we don't have enough!

45
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:46,901
As many as you can.

46
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:51,192
- Where's the old man?
- He's set up a burn ward in 16.

47
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,943
What are you doing? What is that?

48
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,150
Milk. It's milk. Much better than water.

49
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,734
No, no, no. Stop. Stop!

50
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,317
- What are you doing?
- These are radiation burns!

51
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,402
Their clothes are contaminated!

52
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,905
Help me!

53
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:18,776
Get it all off.

54
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,986
We're taking it down to the basement.

55
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,609
He was a firefighter from Chernobyl.

56
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,234
Can you stop pushing, please?

57
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:33,693
We have our orders!

58
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,317
- Disperse!
- Hey, there! Get him!

59
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,818
Why you keeping us out here?

60
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,567
Professor Legasov?

61
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,059
Oh, no, not yet.

62
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:42,693
They're finishing up some other
business. It'll be a few more minutes.

63
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,526
- Can I get you some tea?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

64
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,501
Would you care to read Deputy Chairman
Shcherbina's report while you wait?

65
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,194
Certainly. Thank you.

66
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,778
All right,
Professor. They're ready.

67
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,820
Professor Legasov?

68
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,934
You have my support.

69
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,595
Thank you all for
your duty to this commission.

70
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:33,651
We will begin with Deputy
Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

71
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:37,359
and then we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

72
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,317
Thank you, comrade General Secretary.

73
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,526
I'm pleased to report that the
situation in Chernobyl is stable.

74
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:46,887
Military and civilian patrols
have secured the region,

75
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,234
and Colonel General Pikalov,

76
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:52,150
who commands troops
specializing in chemical hazards,

77
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:54,275
has been dispatched to the plant.

78
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,901
In terms of radiation,
plant director Bryukhanov

79
00:09:56,903 --> 00:10:00,317
reports no more than 3.6 roentgen.

80
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,876
I'm told it's the
equivalent of a chest X-ray.

81
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,859
So if you're overdue for a check-up...

82
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,651
- And foreign press?
- Totally unaware.

83
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:11,359
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

84
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,526
that we have successfully
protected our security interests.

85
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,984
Good. Very good.

86
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:19,569
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand, so...

87
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:23,611
if there's nothing
else, meeting adjourned.

88
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,403
No!

89
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,275
Pardon me?

90
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,693
Uh, we can't adjourn.

91
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,423
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

92
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,109
Professor, if you have any concerns,

93
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,192
feel free to address them with me later.

94
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:43,109
I can't. I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

95
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:46,234
Page three, the section on casualties.

96
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:47,442
Uh...

97
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:50,359
"A fireman was severely
burned on his hand

98
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,818
by a chunk of smooth, black mineral

99
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,360
on the ground, outside
the reactor building."

100
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,401
Smooth, black mineral... graphite.

101
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:00,111
There's-There's graphite on the ground.

102
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:05,442
Well, there was a... a tank
explosion. There's debris.

103
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,401
- Of what importance...?
- There's only one place in the entire facility

104
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:11,693
where you will find
graphite: inside the core.

105
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,442
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

106
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,829
it means it wasn't a control
system tank that exploded.

107
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,236
- It was the reactor core.
- It's open!

108
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,109
Um, Comrade Shcherbina?

109
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,223
Comrade General
Secretary, I can assure you

110
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,150
that Professor Legasov is mistaken.

111
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,609
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

112
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:33,109
- And as for the radiation...
- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

113
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,859
which, by the way, is not the
equivalent of one chest X-ray,

114
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,192
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

115
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:40,892
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

116
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:44,567
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

117
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,401
They gave us the number they had.

118
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,234
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

119
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:53,025
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

120
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:55,150
of four million chest
X-rays in his hand.

121
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,609
Professor Legasov, there's no
place for alarmist hysteria...

122
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,457
It's not alarmist if it's a fact!

123
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,025
Well, I don't hear any facts at all.

124
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:05,651
All I hear is a man I don't know

125
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:08,818
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

126
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,025
to what has been reported
by party officials.

127
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:14,484
I'm, uh... I apologize.

128
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,984
I didn't mean, uh...

129
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,693
Please,
may I express my concern

130
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:24,204
as calmly and as respectfully as I...

131
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,862
- Professor Legasov...
- Boris.

132
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,736
I will allow it.

133
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,484
Um...

134
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,067
An RBMK reactor

135
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:49,359
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

136
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:54,234
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

137
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,442
traveling at nearly the speed of light,

138
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:59,025
penetrating everything in its path:

139
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,234
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

140
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:05,401
Every gram of U-235 holds

141
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:08,613
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

142
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,009
That's in one gram.

143
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:13,275
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

144
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:15,984
and right now, it is on fire.

145
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:20,401
Winds will carry radioactive
particles across the entire continent,

146
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,401
rain will bring them down on us.

147
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:25,767
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

148
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,609
in the... in the air we breathe,

149
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:32,861
the water we drink, the food we eat.

150
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:38,943
Most of these bullets will
not stop firing for 100 years.

151
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:42,317
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

152
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:46,109
Yes, and, uh, this concern

153
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,277
stems entirely from the
description of a rock?

154
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:55,945
Yes.

155
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,381
Hmm.

156
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,444
Comrade Shcherbina...

157
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,901
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

158
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,109
You take a look at the
reactor, you personally,

159
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:12,025
and you report directly back to me.

160
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:14,317
A wise decision, comrade
General Secretary...

161
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,903
And take
Professor Legasov with you.

162
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,192
Uh...

163
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:22,401
Forgive me, comrade
General Secretary, but I...

164
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,778
Do you know how a nuclear reactor works?

165
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,275
- No.
- No.

166
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:31,484
Well, then how will you
know what you're looking at?

167
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,528
Meeting adjourned.

168
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,234
How does a nuclear reactor work?

169
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:37,194
- What?
- It's a simple question.

170
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:40,442
It's hardly a simple answer.

171
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:44,442
Of course, you presume I'm
too stupid to understand.

172
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,818
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

173
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,695
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

174
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,733
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

175
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:08,359
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

176
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:10,401
Where a typical power plant

177
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,359
makes steam by burning coal,

178
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:14,695
a nuclear plant...

179
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:24,526
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

180
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:30,567
We take an unstable
element like uranium 235,

181
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,712
which has too many neutrons.

182
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:35,444
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

183
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:39,063
Yes, the bullet.

184
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,984
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

185
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:44,401
Now...

186
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,317
if we put enough uranium
atoms close together,

187
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,776
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

188
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,943
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

189
00:16:56,945 --> 00:17:00,317
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

190
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,150
- And the graphite?
- Ah, yes.

191
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:07,109
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast... we call this "flux"...

192
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,984
it's relatively unlikely that the
uranium atoms will ever hit one another.

193
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:17,025
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

194
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:22,027
to moderate, slow
down, the neutron flux.

195
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,040
Good.

196
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,085
I know how a nuclear reactor works.

197
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,217
Now I don't need you.

198
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:56,277
- Can you help me? I need to find my husband.
- No. Not now.

199
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,818
- Mikhail!
- Lyudmilla.

200
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,484
Take her.

201
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,401
Take her away from here, please.

202
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:08,109
- Get away from them! You want to get sick? Go!
- Oh my God.

203
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,526
Please take her, please take her.

204
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,359
Please take her, please.

205
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,818
Please! Please!

206
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,528
Please take her!

207
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,651
Excuse me, I am Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

208
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:27,025
He's a fireman. Ignatenko.

209
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:30,609
Ignatenko, Sixth Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue Unit.

210
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,528
I need to find him. Please.

211
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,317
Ignatenko...

212
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,901
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

213
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:42,776
Hospital number six.

214
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,984
Why, is he all right? Can I see him?

215
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,567
You want to see him? Go to Moscow.

216
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,861
But they're not letting us leave here.

217
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,679
Tell them Major Burov allows it.

218
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:58,236
- Oh. When are they taking him?
- Now.

219
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,084
We're approaching
the power plant.

220
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:38,910
What have they done?

221
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:41,707
Can you see inside?

222
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,024
I don't have to. Look.

223
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:47,025
That's graphite on the roof.

224
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,442
The whole building's been blown open.

225
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,776
The core's exposed!

226
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,776
I can't see how you
can tell that from here.

227
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:54,020
Oh, for God's sakes.

228
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:55,775
Look at that glow!

229
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,379
That's radiation ionizing the air!

230
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,234
Well, if we can't see, we don't know.

231
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:01,984
Get us directly over the building!

232
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,239
- Boris, if we fly...
- Don't you use my name!

233
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,024
...directly over an open reactor,
we'll be dead within a week!

234
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:07,486
Dead!

235
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:09,734
Sir?

236
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:12,820
Get us over that building,
or I'll have you shot!

237
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,609
If you fly directly over
that core, I promise you,

238
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:21,361
by tomorrow morning, you'll
be begging for that bullet.

239
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,569
Perhaps if you came back another day.

240
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,025
Just wonderful.

241
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,526
Deputy Secretary Garanin.

242
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:25,776
Ulana Khomyuk of the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

243
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,192
What a pleasure.

244
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:30,069
- Let me introduce...
- I'm here about Chernobyl.

245
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:33,442
Such a lovely time.

246
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:36,903
- Visit again soon.
- I will. Thank you.

247
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:52,109
I must tell you, this
is why no one likes scientists.

248
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,943
When we have a disease
to cure, where are they?

249
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:58,504
In a lab, noses in their
books, and so Grandma dies.

250
00:21:58,507 --> 00:21:59,880
But when there isn't a problem,

251
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,650
they're everywhere, spreading fear.

252
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,109
- I know about Chernobyl.
- Oh?

253
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:07,067
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

254
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:09,567
- Whatever that means.
- And that if you don't immediately

255
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,401
issue iodine tablets and
then evacuate this city,

256
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:15,109
hundreds of thousands of
people are going to get cancer,

257
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:17,309
and God knows how many more will die.

258
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,086
Yes, very good.

259
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,442
There has been an accident at Chernobyl,

260
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,651
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

261
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:25,651
I'm telling you that there is.

262
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,693
I prefer my opinion to yours.

263
00:22:27,695 --> 00:22:31,067
I'm a nuclear physicist.

264
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:32,734
Before you were Deputy Secretary,

265
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,403
you worked in a shoe factory.

266
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:39,111
Yes, I worked in a shoe factory.

267
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:42,136
And now I'm in charge.

268
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:47,277
"To the workers of the world."

269
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,608
Stable iodine will keep your thyroid

270
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:13,986
from absorbing radioactive iodine.

271
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:18,025
Take one a day for as long as they last.

272
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:19,818
And go east.

273
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,277
Get as far from Minsk as you can.

274
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:57,609
It's overkill.

275
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,609
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

276
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:02,734
It doesn't
matter how it looks.

277
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:05,109
Shcherbina is a pure bureaucrat,

278
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,192
as stupid as he is pigheaded.

279
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:09,609
We'll tell him the truth in
the simplest terms possible.

280
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,319
We'll be fine.

281
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:16,403
Pikarov!

282
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:44,693
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

283
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,734
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

284
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,067
are honored at your arrival.

285
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,401
Deeply, deeply honored.

286
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:52,442
Naturally, we regret the
circumstances of your visit,

287
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:54,693
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

288
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,317
in containing the damage.

289
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,567
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

290
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,651
and I have a list of individuals

291
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,444
who we believe are accountable.

292
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,329
Professor
Legasov, I understand

293
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,484
you've been saying dangerous things.

294
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,359
Very dangerous things.

295
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,695
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

296
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:42,611
Please, tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

297
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,901
I'm not prepared to
explain it at this time.

298
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:49,859
As I presumed, he has no answer.

299
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:52,442
It's disgraceful, really.

300
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:55,945
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

301
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:04,776
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

302
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:06,984
Graphite is only found in the core,

303
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:10,526
where it's used as a
neutron flux moderator.

304
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,945
Correct?

305
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:16,361
Fomin, why did the Deputy
Chairman see graphite on the roof?

306
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,403
Well, that... that can't be.

307
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:23,025
Comrade Shcherbina, my
apologies, but graphite...

308
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,317
that's not possible.

309
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,504
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

310
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,526
Now there you made a mistake,

311
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:31,234
because I may not know
much about nuclear reactors,

312
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,861
but I know a lot about concrete.

313
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:36,194
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

314
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:39,734
You think Legasov is wrong.

315
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:41,695
How shall we prove it?

316
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:46,317
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

317
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,359
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

318
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:51,695
mount the dosimeter on the front.

319
00:26:57,486 --> 00:27:00,776
Have one of your men get as
close to the fire as he can.

320
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:02,526
Give him every bit of
protection you have.

321
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,901
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

322
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,903
it may not be enough.

323
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,611
Then I'll do it myself.

324
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:17,236
Good.

325
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,767
He's back.

326
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:48,067
It's not three roentgen.

327
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:49,901
It's 15,000.

328
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:52,651
Comrade Shcherbina...

329
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:54,192
What does that number mean?

330
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,442
It means the core is open.

331
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,984
It means the fire we're
watching with our own eyes

332
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,567
is giving off nearly twice the radiation

333
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,484
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

334
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:04,359
And that's every single hour.

335
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:07,395
Hour after hour, 20
hours since the explosion,

336
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,263
so 40 bombs worth by now.

337
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,681
Forty-eight more tomorrow.

338
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,401
And it will not stop. Not
in a week, not in a month.

339
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:14,984
It will burn and spread its poison

340
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:17,695
until the entire continent is dead.

341
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,150
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

342
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:25,207
to the local party headquarters.

343
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,192
- Thank you for your service.
- Comrade...

344
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:28,569
You're excused.

345
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:31,270
Dyatlov was in charge.

346
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,234
It was Dyatlov!

347
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:36,943
- Tell me how to put it out.
- We'll use helicopters.

348
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,940
- We'll drop water on it like a forest fire.
- No, no. You don't understand.

349
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:42,150
This isn't a fire.

350
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,259
This is a fissioning reactor core

351
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:46,442
burning at over 2,000 degrees.

352
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,109
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water...

353
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:51,277
How do we put it out?

354
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,526
You are dealing with something

355
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:58,986
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

356
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:02,486
Boron.

357
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,943
Boron and sand.

358
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:08,651
Well, that'll create
problems of its own,

359
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,818
but I-I don't see any other way.

360
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,984
Of course, it's going to
take thousands of drops,

361
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:15,651
because you can't fly the
helicopters directly over the core,

362
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,109
so most of it is going to miss.

363
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,514
- How much sand and boron?
- Well, I can't be...

364
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:23,317
- For God's sake, roughly!
- Five thousand tons.

365
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,275
And obviously, we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area...

366
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,275
Never mind that. Focus on the fire.

367
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:31,109
I am focusing on the fire.

368
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:35,317
The wind, it's carrying all that smoke,

369
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,150
all that radiation.

370
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:40,234
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometers away.

371
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,234
- That's my decision to make.
- Then make it.

372
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,984
- I've been told not to.
- Is it or is not...

373
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,859
I'm in charge here!

374
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,609
This will go much
easier if you talk to me

375
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,943
about the things you do understand

376
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:52,695
and not about the things
you do not understand.

377
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:58,025
Where are you going?

378
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:01,861
I'm going to get
you 5,000 tons of sand and boron.

379
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:11,861
There's a hotel.

380
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,736
I'd prefer one of those.

381
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,611
Superstitious?

382
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:30,277
Moscow?

383
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:36,111
Are you here because of the fire?

384
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:42,945
Anything we should be worried about?

385
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,986
No.

386
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:01,986
Ah.

387
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:57,069
We're in
position. Approaching drop.

388
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:00,319
Clear to proceed.

389
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:04,903
Copy. We'll go
one by one in rotation.

390
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:12,194
Remind them about the perimeter.

391
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:17,943
They cannot fly directly over the fire.

392
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:20,234
A minimum of a ten-meter perimeter.

393
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:21,734
Ten meter perimeter. Copy.

394
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,359
Lead One, per pre-flight:

395
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,150
maintain minimum ten-meter perimeter.

396
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:27,317
Copy that.

397
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:30,067
Forty meters... 35...

398
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:31,401
30...

399
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:37,234
No, no, no! They're too close!

400
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,267
They can't get over the
fire. How are they supposed...

401
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:41,067
The wind will have to carry it.

402
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:43,945
Tell them, they cannot go over the core.

403
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:47,693
Lead One is too close.

404
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,569
I repeat, they are too close.

405
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:52,150
Copy.

406
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,067
Lead One, you are inside the perimeter.

407
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,275
Did not copy.
Signal's breaking up.

408
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:03,192
Lead One?

409
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,859
Do you copy?

410
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,859
Lead One, do you copy?

411
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:09,067
Lead One, come in.

412
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,943
Do you copy, Lead One?

413
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:12,653
Lead One!

414
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:33,152
Sir? What do I tell the others?

415
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,442
Is there any other way, Legasov?

416
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,861
Send the next one in.

417
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:51,319
Tell them to approach from the west.

418
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:55,528
Lead Two,
approach from the west.

419
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,025
Kurchatov
Institute Laboratory Four.

420
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:23,486
Marina Gruzinskaya,
it's Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.

421
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:28,359
Oh, yes, how nice of you to phone.

422
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:30,359
- It's been too long.
- It has.

423
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:33,025
I was actually calling about our friend.

424
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:35,359
- You know, the one in the country.
- Oh, yes, of course.

425
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:39,192
I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.

426
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:41,693
Yes, it's extremely hot,

427
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:43,109
but his nephews are flying down,

428
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:45,192
and they always bring cool weather.

429
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:46,820
Oh? Which nephews?

430
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:51,693
Simka, who's 14, and
little Boris, who's five.

431
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:52,984
Well, that's wonderful.

432
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,859
Though children can make you even hotter

433
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:56,693
when they're crawling all over you.

434
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:58,192
Maybe I should visit them.

435
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,067
No, they don't want visitors.

436
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,442
I'm sorry, um, I have
to get back to work.

437
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:04,861
It's very busy right now. Goodbye.

438
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:10,236
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

439
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:12,778
It's what I would do.

440
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,277
Yes, I'm sure it is.

441
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,236
Where are you going?

442
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,736
Chernobyl.

443
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:53,150
It's been smooth. Twenty drops.

444
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,569
What?

445
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:06,526
There are 50,000 people in this city.

446
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:11,234
Professor Ilyin,
who's also on the commission,

447
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:14,192
says the radiation isn't
high enough to evacuate.

448
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:15,943
Ilyin isn't a physicist.

449
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:19,025
Well, he's a medical doctor.
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

450
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:21,567
- Not if they stay here.
- We're staying here.

451
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:26,067
Yes, we are, and we'll
be dead in five years.

452
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:36,484
I'm sorry, I...

453
00:39:36,486 --> 00:39:38,027
I'm sorry.

454
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,736
Shcherbina.

455
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,528
Thank you.

456
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:40,650
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation

457
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:43,736
and identified it as a
byproduct of our fuel.

458
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,528
The Americans took satellite photos.

459
00:40:48,486 --> 00:40:51,859
The reactor building,
the smoke, the fire.

460
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,403
The whole world knows.

461
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:05,569
The wind has been
blowing toward Germany.

462
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,569
They're not letting
children play outside...

463
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:13,027
in Frankfurt.

464
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:26,528
Want a smoke?

465
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:44,609
There has been a
nuclear accident in the Soviet Union

466
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:46,442
and the Soviets have
admitted that it happened.

467
00:41:46,444 --> 00:41:48,067
The Soviet version is this:

468
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,567
One of the atomic reactors

469
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,234
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

470
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:54,901
was damaged, and there
is speculation in Moscow

471
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:57,192
that people were injured
and may have died.

472
00:41:57,194 --> 00:42:00,401
The Soviets may have been fairly
quick to acknowledge the accident

473
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:03,776
because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation

474
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:07,820
had already reached beyond the
Soviet borders to Scandinavia.

475
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:24,943
I said turn around. This
is a restricted zone.

476
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:27,743
I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

477
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,401
Do you have permission?

478
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,734
Listen to me, I need to
speak to someone urgently.

479
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:34,192
Turn around right now,
or I'll arrest you.

480
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:36,025
If you arrest me, you should take me

481
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,236
to the highest possible authority.

482
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:45,359
We have to start
a radiological survey.

483
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:49,569
Sector by sector, on
foot, dosimeters in hand.

484
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:52,945
Are you all right?

485
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:56,903
Of course.

486
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:59,526
Comrades...

487
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:02,234
The guards arrested this
woman at the south checkpoint.

488
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:06,567
- I'd have put her in a cell...
- But he thought you should know that I know.

489
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:08,647
I know that your
reactor core is exposed.

490
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,442
I know the graphite is on
fire, the fuel is melting,

491
00:47:11,444 --> 00:47:13,442
and you're dropping
sand and boron on it,

492
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:16,776
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a mistake.

493
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:19,943
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk, Chief Physicist,

494
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:22,317
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

495
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,651
And you are Valery Alexeyevich Legasov?

496
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:28,275
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

497
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:31,150
but the temperature will
eventually increase...

498
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,776
Believe me,
I'm perfectly aware.

499
00:47:32,778 --> 00:47:34,901
But I estimate at least a month

500
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:36,901
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

501
00:47:36,903 --> 00:47:38,901
- which gives us time...
- No, you don't have a month.

502
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:40,611
You have approximately two days.

503
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,818
Yes, the fuel would take a month

504
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,943
to reach the concrete pad here.

505
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:50,526
But first... it's going to burn through

506
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:52,984
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

507
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:56,067
And when it does, it's
going to hit these tanks...

508
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:57,442
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

509
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:00,693
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

510
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,693
but I confirmed it with plant personnel.

511
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:06,359
- The tanks are nearly empty.
- No, they were nearly empty.

512
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:09,901
Each of these points
here, here, and here

513
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:11,984
all drain to the bubbler pools.

514
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:14,609
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

515
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:17,651
And then there are those fire
engines that I saw on the way in.

516
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:19,859
The fire hoses are still connected.

517
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,984
They've been gushing water into
the structure this whole time.

518
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,945
The tanks are full.

519
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,486
The tanks are full.

520
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,011
_

521
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:39,625
_

522
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:42,909
_

523
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:46,659
_

524
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:49,370
_

525
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:52,132
_

526
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:12,859
I have ten minutes, then
I'm back on the phone

527
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:15,859
apologizing to our friends,

528
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:19,109
apologizing to our enemies.

529
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:22,526
Our power comes from the
perception of our power.

530
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:26,234
Do you understand the
damage this has done?

531
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:29,444
Do you understand what's at stake?

532
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:32,403
Boris.

533
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:38,903
Professor Legasov will
deliver our briefing.

534
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:42,150
There is some good news.

535
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:44,901
The air drops are
working to douse the fire.

536
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:48,734
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

537
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,651
but the fire will not be extinguished

538
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:53,528
for at least another two weeks.

539
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:58,444
There is also an additional problem.

540
00:49:59,986 --> 00:50:01,818
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

541
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,567
simply because it is not on fire.

542
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,275
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

543
00:50:06,277 --> 00:50:09,067
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

544
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:11,943
The uranium will melt the sand,

545
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:13,734
creating a kind of lava

546
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:17,109
which will begin to melt
down through the shield below.

547
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:18,653
You have made lava?

548
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,444
I anticipated this.

549
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:27,317
I believed there was time to reinforce

550
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,442
this lower concrete pad

551
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,984
before the lava reached the earth

552
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,609
and contaminated the groundwater.

553
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:35,776
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

554
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:37,734
Uh, um...

555
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:41,401
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

556
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:44,067
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

557
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:47,234
This is Ulana Khomyuk of
the Byelorussian Institute.

558
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:49,609
Thanks to her insight, we are now aware

559
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:52,984
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

560
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:56,861
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

561
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:02,901
When the lava enters these tanks,

562
00:51:02,903 --> 00:51:05,631
it will instantly superheat and vaporize

563
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:09,067
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

564
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,651
causing a significant thermal explosion.

565
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,693
How significant?

566
00:51:14,695 --> 00:51:18,651
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

567
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:22,025
Everything within a 30-kilometer radius

568
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:23,776
will be completely destroyed,

569
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:27,192
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

570
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:30,776
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

571
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:33,943
will be ejected at force

572
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:37,067
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

573
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:42,359
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

574
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:45,734
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev

575
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,859
as well as a portion of Minsk.

576
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:50,859
The release of radiation will be severe

577
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:54,192
and will impact all of Soviet Ukraine,

578
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,901
Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia,

579
00:51:57,903 --> 00:52:01,234
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

580
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:03,903
Romania, and most of East Germany.

581
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:10,444
What do you mean "impact"?

582
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:13,859
For much of the area, a
nearly permanent disruption

583
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:16,484
of the food and water supply,

584
00:52:16,486 --> 00:52:19,567
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

585
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,109
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

586
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:25,067
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

587
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:27,484
"impact" means completely uninhabitable

588
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:30,903
for a minimum of 100 years.

589
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:38,234
There are more than 50 million people

590
00:52:38,236 --> 00:52:41,067
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

591
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:42,903
Sixty, yes.

592
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,109
And how long before this happens?

593
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:52,986
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

594
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:58,943
But we may have a solution.

595
00:52:58,945 --> 00:53:00,818
We can pump the water from the tanks.

596
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,317
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

597
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,526
and the gate can only be opened manually

598
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:08,150
from within the duct system itself.

599
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:11,401
So we need to find three plant workers

600
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:13,067
who know the facility well enough

601
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:14,776
to enter the basement here,

602
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:19,109
find their way through
all these duct ways,

603
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,275
get to the sluice gate valve here,

604
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:25,818
and give us the access we
need to pump out the tanks.

605
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,651
Of course, we will need your permission.

606
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,776
My permission for what?

607
00:53:30,778 --> 00:53:33,317
Uh, the water in these ducts,

608
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:36,234
the level of radioactive
contamination...

609
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:38,653
They'll likely be dead in a week.

610
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:44,152
We're asking for your
permission to kill three men.

611
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,776
Well...

612
00:53:53,778 --> 00:53:56,442
Comrade Legasov...

613
00:53:56,444 --> 00:54:00,194
all victories
inevitably come at a cost.

614
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:29,234
And open the
sluice gate valve... here.

615
00:55:29,236 --> 00:55:31,317
The valve will be difficult to operate,

616
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,234
so we'll need three men

617
00:55:33,236 --> 00:55:36,859
who will need to know
the basement layout.

618
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:40,901
And, of course, any
volunteers will be rewarded.

619
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:45,319
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

620
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:56,442
And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

621
00:55:56,444 --> 00:56:00,275
Why are reactors one and
two still operating at all?

622
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:02,442
My friend was a security
guard that night,

623
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:04,109
and, uh, she's now dying.

624
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,818
And we've all heard about the firemen.

625
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,820
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

626
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:13,818
Do you even know how contaminated it is?

627
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,776
I... I don't have an exact number.

628
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:20,653
You don't need an exact number
to know if it'll kill us.

629
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:22,573
But you can't even tell us that.

630
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:26,984
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

631
00:56:30,444 --> 00:56:33,194
You'll do it because it must be done.

632
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:41,152
You'll do it because nobody else can.

633
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:47,152
And if you don't, millions will die.

634
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,277
If you tell me that's not
enough, I won't believe you.

635
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:56,651
This is what has always
set our people apart.

636
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:59,861
A thousand years of
sacrifice in our veins.

637
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:03,486
And every generation must
know its own suffering.

638
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:07,359
I spit on the people who did this,

639
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,986
and I curse the price I have to pay.

640
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:14,609
But I'm making my peace with it,

641
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,442
and now you make yours.

642
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:19,194
And go into that water.

643
00:57:21,277 --> 00:57:23,025
Because it must be done.

644
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:41,736
Ananenko.

645
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:47,569
Bezpalov.

646
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:54,366
Baranov.
