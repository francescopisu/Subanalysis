1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,548
Why didn't you
press the AZ-5 button?

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,282
We did. And that's when it exploded.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,906
I don't want my
men here one more second

4
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,033
than they need to be.

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,115
If these worked, you'd be wearing them.

6
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,572
Vasily...

7
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:20,074
We're gonna have a baby.

8
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:23,697
Do you have any
idea what you're dealing with?

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,031
People are going to hear.

10
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,616
What is everyone gonna hear?

11
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:30,146
We have to
pursue every possibility,

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,781
no matter who is to blame.

13
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:36,321
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

14
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:37,908
How many men do you require?

15
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:41,074
Approximately 750,000 men.

16
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,005
It's time to go.

17
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,155
Did you hear me?

18
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:33,697
This is an evacuation. You understand?

19
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,489
You have to come with me.

20
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,322
Why?

21
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:40,489
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

22
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:43,072
Everyone in this village, everyone.

23
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:45,072
It's not safe here. There's
radiation in the air.

24
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:47,113
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,781
Do you know how old I am?

26
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:53,031
I don't know. Old.

27
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:55,489
I'm 82.

28
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,906
I've lived here my whole life.

29
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:01,322
Right here, that house, this place.

30
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:05,322
What do I care about safe?

31
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:09,322
I have a job.
Don't cause trouble.

32
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,781
Trouble?

33
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:14,864
You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.

34
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,989
When I was 12, the revolution came.

35
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,967
Czar's men. Then Bolsheviks.

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,112
Boys like you marching in lines.

37
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,447
They told us to leave. No.

38
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,031
Then there was Stalin and his famine,

39
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,197
the Holodomor.

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,322
My parents died. Two of my sisters died.

41
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,031
They told the rest of us to leave.

42
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,697
No.

43
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,530
Then the Great War.

44
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,822
German boys. Russian boys.

45
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:50,365
More soldiers, more famine, more bodies.

46
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:54,197
My brothers never came home.

47
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,822
But I stayed, and I'm still here.

48
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:01,072
After all that I have seen...

49
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,238
so I should leave now,

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,906
because of something
I cannot see at all?

51
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:07,947
No.

52
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:25,407
Just one moment!

53
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,991
It's time to go.

54
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,989
Please stand up now.

55
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,240
This is your last warning.

56
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,823
It's time to go.

57
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:47,787
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

58
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,532
Come on.

59
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,783
Point four.

60
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,282
Point six.

61
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:56,282
Fifteen.

62
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:54,739
Legasov.

63
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,699
I'll meet him there.

64
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,616
The atom is a humbling thing.

65
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,908
It's not humbling, it's humiliating.

66
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:07,572
Why is the core still
exposed to the air?

67
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,614
Why have we not already covered it up?

68
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,572
We want to, but we
can't get close enough.

69
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:17,489
The debris on the roof is
graphite from the core itself.

70
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,655
Until we can push it off the
roof back into the reactor,

71
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:23,947
it'll kill anyone who gets near it.

72
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,405
You can see the roof is in three levels.

73
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:31,655
We've named them... the
small one here is Katya.

74
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:33,864
One thousand roentgen per hour.

75
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,864
Presume two hours of exposure is fatal.

76
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,614
The one on the side... Nina.

77
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,822
Two thousand roentgen. One hour, fatal.

78
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:44,072
We used remote-controlled
bulldozers in Afghanistan.

79
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:47,238
Too heavy. They'd fall right through.

80
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,989
- So then...?
- Moon rovers.

81
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,024
Lunokhod STR-1's. They're light.

82
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,822
And if we line them with lead,
they can withstand the radiation.

83
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:58,047
We couldn't
put a man on the moon.

84
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,572
At least we can keep a man off a roof.

85
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,822
That is the most
important thing, General.

86
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:05,989
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

87
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,489
Robots only.

88
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,157
What about this large section here?

89
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:13,616
Masha.

90
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:16,491
Twelve thousand roentgen.

91
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,550
If you were to stand there in full

92
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,989
protective gear head-to-toe
for two minutes,

93
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,864
your life expectancy
would be cut in half.

94
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:26,322
By three minutes, you're
dead within months.

95
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:29,489
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

96
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,659
That amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

97
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,404
The particles literally shred

98
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,489
the circuits in microchips apart.

99
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,322
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

100
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,906
Masha will destroy it.

101
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,405
It would be fair to say that

102
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,532
that piece of roof is the
most dangerous place on Earth.

103
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,365
So... what do we do?

104
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,657
That's what we wanted to ask you.

105
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:18,866
Tent 181?

106
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,908
It's all right. It's free.

107
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,699
It's a little early.

108
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,157
Bacho.

109
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,414
Pavel.

110
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:58,365
- Yeah?
- Mm.

111
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,822
What unit were you in?

112
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,238
Uh, they had me in motor pool in Kiev,

113
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,072
- but then they...
- Not this bullshit.

114
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,489
In Afghanistan.

115
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:14,699
Oh, um, I wasn't in Afghanistan.

116
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,616
I'm not in the military.

117
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,616
They're running out of men.

118
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,405
Showers. Food.

119
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:40,197
Those guys, they dig up the ground.

120
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,781
Those guys, they cut down trees.

121
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:46,322
Those guys, they
evacuate people, I think,

122
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,783
like villagers.

123
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,324
What about them?

124
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,324
I don't know them. Fuck them.

125
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,368
Janek!

126
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:00,739
- What do you want?
- Give me an egg basket.

127
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,991
- No, I've only got the one...
- Give me the fucking basket!

128
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,947
He's with me, you understand?

129
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:11,616
Nobody fucks with him.

130
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:15,989
We make these from lead scrap.

131
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,322
- Put it on under your balls.
- Now?

132
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:21,238
No, no. You can wait until
the radiation gives you a cunt.

133
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,908
Yes, now.

134
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,949
Over your clothes. Fucking shit.

135
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,608
- You ever go hunting?
- No.

136
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,781
Well... today's your lucky day.

137
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:45,238
You, me,

138
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:49,034
that ugly Armenian in the tent,
Garo, we do animal control.

139
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,864
Animal control?

140
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,947
Yeah, they're radioactive,

141
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,280
so they have to go.

142
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,572
But it's not hard. They're mostly pets.

143
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,933
They're happy to see you.
They run right up to you.

144
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:02,971
Bang!

145
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:04,697
You load the bodies on the truck,

146
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,155
dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete.

147
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,947
And then we drink.

148
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:13,199
As much vodka as you want,
plus a thousand rubles.

149
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,917
Let's go get you a gun.

150
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,238
Yes?

151
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,405
I need to see the following documents.

152
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,240
They're listed as permission only.

153
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,741
I'm working for the Central Committee.

154
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:52,991
Comrade?

155
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:32,824
She can have that one.

156
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:43,324
Thank you, Comrade.

157
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,781
All clear.

158
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:25,280
Bring up the cameras.

159
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,447
- Signal?
- Acceptable.

160
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,447
Running onboard diagnostics.

161
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,363
Tell me when
we're ready to move it.

162
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:38,616
To think that's what we put on the moon.

163
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,657
Well, not that one.

164
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,113
I know not that one.

165
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:49,697
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

166
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,991
That should cover Nina and Katya.

167
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,280
And Masha?

168
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,447
The Central
Committee have informed me

169
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:57,989
that they may have found something

170
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,655
that could work up
there. From the outside.

171
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,447
American?

172
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,447
Of course not.

173
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,238
It's a German police robot.

174
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,739
West German, so, as you can imagine,

175
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,197
that wasn't an easy
conversation to have.

176
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,489
Diagnostics complete.

177
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:14,991
Ready to engage main power and motor.

178
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:16,949
Begin.

179
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,311
Can we move it?

180
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:40,157
Valery, what's that? A smile?

181
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,989
I see your condition
has improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

182
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:03,532
No. Leave.

183
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,383
I need your help.

184
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:24,572
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

185
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,282
- When you gave the order...
- Order? What order?

186
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:32,033
Toptunov called it
out, Akimov pressed it.

187
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,781
It was the only good decision they made.

188
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,365
Incompetent morons.

189
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,363
Can you confirm that
the reactor exploded

190
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,199
after they attempted to shut it down?

191
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,574
How do I even know it exploded, huh?

192
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:09,115
I found this in the state archive.

193
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,113
Written in 1976.

194
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:16,113
It's about the operation of RBMK
reactors under extreme conditions.

195
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:17,739
So?

196
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,197
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

197
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,324
and two pages have been removed.

198
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:26,447
Well, the State must
protect its secrets, Comrade.

199
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,989
Do you dare suggest otherwise?

200
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,324
They made a mistake.

201
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:35,991
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

202
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,530
The missing pages apparently refer

203
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:52,450
to a positive void
coefficient and AZ-5.

204
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,822
Does that mean anything to you?

205
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,322
What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

206
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,697
You worked with the reactor.
You know it better than I do.

207
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,864
So everything's my fault, then?

208
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:03,989
Is that what this is?

209
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:05,294
I'm not here to blame you.

210
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:07,878
I'm here to find out what happened.

211
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,572
And whether you realize it or not,

212
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,824
I'm your best chance to avoid a bullet.

213
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,282
Can you help me or not?

214
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:27,197
I have no idea what would've gone here.

215
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,240
Void coefficients have
nothing to do with AZ-5.

216
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:33,238
There. Now you can go.

217
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,033
- You're not even curious?
- What for?

218
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:40,532
You think the right question
will get you the truth?

219
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:43,906
There is no truth.

220
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:47,864
Ask the bosses whatever you
want and you'll get the lie.

221
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,199
And I will get the bullet.

222
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,211
I only have two rules.

223
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:27,030
One.

224
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:30,113
Don't point this gun at
me. That's easy, right?

225
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:32,113
You can point it at this piece of shit.

226
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:34,322
I don't give a fuck. Never me.

227
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,197
Two.

228
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:39,655
If you hit an animal and it doesn't die,

229
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:42,447
keep shooting until it does.

230
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:46,530
Don't let them suffer, or I'll kill you.

231
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,563
Understand?

232
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,899
I mean it.

233
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,115
I've killed a lot of people.

234
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,699
Good. Then we're ready.

235
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:43,739
Once we start, they'll run
inside where they feel safe.

236
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:45,824
So we go door-to-door.

237
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,319
Okay?

238
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,823
Good.

239
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:41,155
Hey!

240
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:44,115
Do your job. Door-to-door.

241
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:40,197
Go. Go.

242
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,657
Go away. Go!

243
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:40,572
Don't let them suffer.

244
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:42,532
Sorry. Sorry.

245
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:47,074
You're dragging that to the truck.

246
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,574
You gonna eat?

247
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:37,616
Drink.

248
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,616
Again.

249
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:55,991
Look...

250
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,783
This happens to everyone
their first time.

251
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,074
Normally when you kill a man.

252
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:07,447
But for you, a dog.

253
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:09,699
So what? There's no shame in it.

254
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:14,530
You remember your first time, Garo?

255
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,157
My first time... Afghanistan.

256
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,489
We were moving through a house,

257
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:26,491
and suddenly a man was there
and I shot him in the stomach.

258
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,449
Yeah, that's a real war story.

259
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:33,814
They're never any good
stories like in the movies.

260
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,696
They're shit.

261
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:39,555
A man was there... boom, stomach.

262
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,197
I was so scared, I didn't
pull the trigger again

263
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,991
for the rest of the day.

264
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:51,033
I thought, "Well, that's it, Bacho.

265
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,697
You put a bullet in someone.

266
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,031
You're not you anymore.

267
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,991
You'll never be you again."

268
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:03,363
But then you wake up the next morning,

269
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,240
and you're still you.

270
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:07,908
And you realize...

271
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,739
that was you all along.

272
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,574
You just didn't know.

273
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:26,574
The happiness of all mankind.

274
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:31,553
What?

275
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:37,031
"Our goal is the
happiness of all mankind."

276
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,666
Yeah.

277
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,024
I'm happy.

278
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:52,736
I'm happy every day.

279
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:58,407
All right. Back to work.

280
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:01,199
Come on.

281
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:20,866
It's here.

282
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,699
All right.

283
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,489
Get over.

284
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,574
Right. Hang on.

285
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,491
Easy now. Careful.

286
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:00,994
Hold it!

287
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:10,824
Joker.

288
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:15,072
It's what the Germans named it: "Joker."

289
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:18,074
- Is it ready?
- It's ready.

290
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,655
Good signal.

291
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,240
Cameras.

292
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:11,842
Motors.

293
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:17,031
Motors, good. Signals, good.

294
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,655
All right, let's take this easy.

295
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:21,949
Forward one meter, reverse one meter.

296
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,491
Forward one.

297
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,908
Germans.

298
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:33,783
Reverse one.

299
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:49,115
Did you lose the signal?

300
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:55,657
It's not the signal. It's the vehicle.

301
00:37:57,324 --> 00:37:58,783
It's dead.

302
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,824
Shit.

303
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,489
Of course I know they're listening!

304
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,655
I want them to hear! I
want them to hear it all!

305
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:16,730
Do you know
what we're doing here?!

306
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:19,157
Tell those geniuses what they have done!

307
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,033
I don't give a fuck!

308
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,989
Tell them! Go tell them! Ryzhkov!

309
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,530
Go tell them he's a joke!

310
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,197
Tell fucking Gorbachev!

311
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:33,199
Tell them!

312
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:57,697
The official position of the State

313
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,989
is that a global nuclear catastrophe

314
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,405
is not possible in the Soviet Union.

315
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:07,031
They told the Germans that the
highest detected level of radiation

316
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,870
was 2,000 roentgen.

317
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:12,407
They gave them the propaganda number.

318
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:17,199
That robot was never going to work.

319
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:23,074
We need a new phone.

320
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,655
What if we don't clear it?

321
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,739
We have to clear it.

322
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:12,741
If we don't clear the
roof, we can't build a cover over it.

323
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:17,696
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

324
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:22,245
That's nearly twice the
radiation from the Hiroshima bomb.

325
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:26,363
- Every hour, hour after...
- I know, I know, I know.

326
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:28,324
What about lead?

327
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:31,155
We could... I don't know.

328
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:34,453
We could melt it and pour it
from above, like a coating.

329
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:37,405
First of all, we've
already used most of the lead we had...

330
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,655
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

331
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:41,447
in the other reactor buildings.

332
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:44,405
The soldiers are stripping
it for their armor.

333
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,157
Are you serious?

334
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:50,947
Even if, we're
still talking about

335
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,072
boiling metal in a helicopter.

336
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:55,699
And it's lead, Boris,
it'll weight a ton.

337
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:01,471
What if we shoot the
graphite into the hole?

338
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:04,430
We've got high-caliber
bullets, exploding bullets.

339
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:06,447
They wouldn't just ricochet, they'd push...

340
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,864
You wanna shoot exploding bullets

341
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,781
at an exposed nuclear reactor?

342
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,031
- Well...
- No, no.

343
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,055
Let's go light that roof back on fire.

344
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,113
It was so easy to put
out the first time.

345
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:21,657
What are we talking about here?

346
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,324
We need another robot.

347
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,072
One that can withstand the radiation.

348
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:31,532
I've asked. There is nothing.

349
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,614
The Americans?

350
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:36,572
If the Americans had
that kind of technology,

351
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,447
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

352
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:41,489
And even if they would, the Central
Committee will never stoop to ask.

353
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:43,199
You know it, I know it.

354
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:46,199
There are no robots.

355
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:55,072
Biorobots.

356
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:56,741
What was that?

357
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,866
We use biorobots.

358
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:08,847
Men.

359
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,824
A lot today.

360
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:46,157
Where do they get their food?

361
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,033
They eat the chickens.

362
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,657
Then they eat each other.

363
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,033
Door-to-door.

364
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:18,899
Pavel?

365
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:25,123
Pavel!

366
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:36,616
You don't hear me? I'm talking to you.

367
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:40,146
Fuck.

368
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,906
Just go outside.

369
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:54,657
Go.

370
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:49,864
Comrade soldiers,

371
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:52,655
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

372
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:54,322
They want us to clean this up,

373
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:57,072
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

374
00:48:57,074 --> 00:48:59,447
Because of the nature
of the working area,

375
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:03,489
you will each have no more than
90 seconds to solve this problem.

376
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:06,447
Listen carefully to
each of my instructions,

377
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,989
and do exactly as you have been told.

378
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:13,739
This is for your own safety
and the safety of your comrades.

379
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:16,113
You will enter Reactor Building Three,

380
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:19,947
climb the stairs but do not
immediately proceed to the roof.

381
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:22,031
When you get to the top, wait inside,

382
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:25,113
behind the entrance to the
roof and catch your breath.

383
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:27,739
You will need it for what comes next.

384
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:30,864
This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.

385
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:34,447
Some of it is in blocks, weighing
approximately 40 to 50 kilograms.

386
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:36,655
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

387
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:40,655
Watch your comrades moving
fast from this opening,

388
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:42,322
then turning to the left,

389
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:44,530
and entering the workspace here.

390
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:46,238
Take care not to stumble.

391
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,822
There's a hole in the
roof. Take care not to fall.

392
00:49:49,824 --> 00:49:54,614
You will need to move quickly, and
you will need to move carefully.

393
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,238
Do you understand your
mission as I have described it?

394
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,197
Yes, Comrade General.

395
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,697
These are the most
important 90 seconds of your lives.

396
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,115
Commit your task to
memory, then do your job.

397
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:52,260
It's time to go. After 90
seconds, I will ring a bell.

398
00:50:52,263 --> 00:50:54,154
When you hear it, return immediately,

399
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:55,530
drop your shovels in the bin,

400
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:58,362
and proceed down the
hallway for decontamination.

401
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:00,155
Above all, while on the roof,

402
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,697
throw your debris over the rail.

403
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,607
Do not look over the
rail. Is that clear?

404
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:06,066
Very well.

405
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:08,818
On my mark. Ready. Go.

406
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,157
Whoa!

407
00:53:21,652 --> 00:53:22,783
Comrade soldier.

408
00:53:24,394 --> 00:53:25,894
You're done.

409
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,447
Time to go.

410
00:53:52,172 --> 00:53:54,631
Oh! Your glove!

411
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,074
Mommy! Mommy!

412
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:22,906
I'm sorry for all this.

413
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:26,655
But we needed to speak to
you somewhere without...

414
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,655
They're going
to put Dyatlov on trial,

415
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:32,031
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

416
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:36,031
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

417
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,614
all three of us.

418
00:55:37,616 --> 00:55:40,197
But that's... Before that happens...

419
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:43,739
The Central Committee is
sending Legasov to Vienna.

420
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,914
It's the headquarters
of the International...

421
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:49,199
Atomic Energy Agency. Yeah,
I know what's in Vienna.

422
00:55:50,991 --> 00:55:52,739
What are they asking you to do?

423
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:55,783
Tell the world what happened.

424
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:02,822
Well, then you better
know what happened.

425
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:04,864
I've constructed a timeline,

426
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,530
minute by minute.

427
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:09,697
Second by second in some places.

428
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,572
Every decision, every button push,

429
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:13,739
every turn of a switch.

430
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:16,697
And? Are they guilty?

431
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:18,155
Yes.

432
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:22,238
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

433
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,489
recklessness beyond belief.

434
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:27,155
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

435
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:29,491
What do you mean you're not sure?

436
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,489
I've analyzed the data.

437
00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:34,739
Toptunov was telling the truth.

438
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:38,115
They shut the reactor
down, and then it exploded.

439
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:42,989
I think this article my have the answer,

440
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:46,449
but two pages have been removed.

441
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,947
You've seen this before.

442
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,781
Please, believe me when I tell you that

443
00:56:56,783 --> 00:56:59,280
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

444
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,282
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

445
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:06,980
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

446
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:09,072
a fuel channel ruptured.

447
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:10,947
The operators pressed AZ-5,

448
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:13,781
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

449
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:16,739
for a brief moment it went up.

450
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:18,428
How is that possible?

451
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:20,031
Well, this was the very question posed

452
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,031
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

453
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,072
He's the one who wrote this article.

454
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,906
When an RBMK reactor runs at low
power, it's notoriously unstable.

455
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:31,322
Prone to swings in reactivity.

456
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:32,822
Under normal circumstances,

457
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,739
the control rods can
compensate for that.

458
00:57:34,741 --> 00:57:36,197
Under normal circumstances.

459
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,739
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

460
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,655
They pulled almost all
the control rods out

461
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:42,920
to bring the power back up.

462
00:57:42,923 --> 00:57:45,572
This is what Volkov
learned from Leningrad.

463
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:47,072
If the boron control rods

464
00:57:47,074 --> 00:57:49,864
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

465
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,238
when they're put back in,

466
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,447
the first thing that
enters the core isn't boron.

467
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:56,657
It's graphite.

468
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:02,155
The control rods have graphite tips

469
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,655
that displace water and steam.

470
00:58:04,657 --> 00:58:07,072
So the reactivity doesn't go down.

471
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:09,238
It goes up dramatically.

472
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:12,697
Why on Earth would
they press that button?

473
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:14,699
They didn't know.

474
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:19,238
Volkov warned the Kremlin,

475
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,991
ten years ago.

476
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:24,363
But there could be no doubt

477
00:58:24,365 --> 00:58:28,322
about the supremacy of the
Soviet nuclear industry.

478
00:58:28,324 --> 00:58:30,238
Ah.

479
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,908
The KGB classified it as a state secret.

480
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:37,739
When I saw
the reactor blown open,

481
00:58:37,741 --> 00:58:41,280
I still didn't think it
could be this flaw in AZ-5.

482
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:44,405
Because the flaw will
not lead to an explosion

483
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:49,655
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

484
00:58:49,657 --> 00:58:52,572
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

485
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,616
But not only their fault.

486
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,532
No.

487
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:01,240
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

488
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:07,238
You can't possibly be that naive.

489
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,739
There are 16 RBMK reactors

490
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:13,614
running in the Soviet Union right now.

491
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,655
We have to fix them.

492
00:59:15,657 --> 00:59:18,447
The only way to do that is to go public,

493
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:20,530
force the Central
Committee to take action.

494
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,614
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

495
00:59:23,616 --> 00:59:26,697
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

496
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:29,238
We can make a deal with the KGB.

497
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,405
You'll leave this
information out in Vienna,

498
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:34,614
and they quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

499
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:37,031
A deal with the KGB?

500
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,741
And I'm "naive."

501
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:43,530
They'll go after your
family, they'll go after your friends.

502
00:59:43,532 --> 00:59:46,447
You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

503
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,405
If that chance was mine...

504
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:50,074
But it isn't, is it?

505
00:59:51,324 --> 00:59:54,530
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

506
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,781
Men who had their
moment and did nothing.

507
00:59:56,783 --> 01:00:00,989
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

508
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:03,697
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

509
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:05,906
It leaves you.

510
01:00:05,908 --> 01:00:10,449
And all you want at that
moment is not to be shot.

511
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:16,947
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

512
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,491
No.

513
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,655
He was a fireman.

514
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:25,822
He died two weeks after the accident.

515
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:28,584
I've been looking in on his widow.

516
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:30,455
She gave birth.

517
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,154
A girl.

518
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:34,449
The baby lived for four hours.

519
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,572
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

520
01:00:37,574 --> 01:00:40,045
but the baby absorbed it instead.

521
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:41,465
Her baby.

522
01:00:43,324 --> 01:00:44,947
We live in a country

523
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,657
where children have to
die to save their mothers.

524
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:51,033
To hell with your deal.

525
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,365
And to hell with our lives.

526
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,199
Someone has to start telling the truth.

527
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,822
Congratulations, comrades.

528
01:01:15,824 --> 01:01:19,447
You are the last of 3,828 men.

529
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:22,197
You have performed
your duties perfectly.

530
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:24,697
I wish you good health and long life.

531
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:27,655
All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 rubles.

532
01:01:27,657 --> 01:01:29,489
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

533
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:31,405
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

534
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:33,155
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

535
01:01:33,204 --> 01:01:34,989
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

536
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,989
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

537
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,739
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

538
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:40,290
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

539
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:41,835
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

540
01:01:41,883 --> 01:01:43,824
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

542
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:44,132
This session
of court is now open.

543
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:47,240
The state calls Comrade Khomyuk.

544
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,906
To understand
what happened that night,

545
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:52,732
we have to go back to
the first critical moment.

546
01:05:52,735 --> 01:05:54,711
The time is 28 past midnight.

547
01:05:57,824 --> 01:06:00,864
At the trial, you're
going to tell the truth.

548
01:06:00,866 --> 01:06:03,072
1:22 a.m.

549
01:06:03,074 --> 01:06:05,197
Once it's over, we
will have our villains.

550
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,322
We will have our hero.
We will have our truth.

551
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:11,072
1:23 and 35 seconds.

552
01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:13,614
Comrade Boris Shcherbina.

553
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:16,781
It began with... a safety test.

554
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:18,602
1:23:42.

555
01:06:19,365 --> 01:06:23,282
They died rescuing
each other. Putting out fires.

556
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:25,031
Tending to the wounded.

557
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:26,779
1:23:45.

558
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,032
When your testimony arrives,

559
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:31,072
insist on reform.

560
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,280
I've already given my life.

561
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:35,447
Isn't that enough?

562
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,669
The state calls Comrade Legasov.
