1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,600
That's right.

2
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,303
Just a few more.

3
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,379
We're nearly done here.

4
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,695
Police.

5
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,231
Oh, hello, who have I reached?

6
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,999
<i>Meeker County sheriff's.</i>

7
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,101
I'm looking for Gloria Burgle.

8
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,871
- Speaking.
- My name is Larue Dollard.

9
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,873
I work for
the internal revenue service.

10
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,209
I am in receipt
of the documents you sent.

11
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,977
But I have a few questions.

12
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,078
Who is this?

13
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>Agent Dollard. IRS.</i>

14
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,418
The envelope you sent was
addressed to me specifically.

15
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,119
You included a note.

16
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,390
IRS? I never sent
anything to...

17
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,492
Well, it has your name on it.

18
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,195
Look,
this is my last day, so...

19
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,966
Are you working a case involving
Emmit Stussy or Stussy lots Itd?

20
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,770
How did you get this number?

21
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,173
Again, it was on
the note you sent.

22
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,209
Spreadsheets, uh, contracts,
loan agreements.

23
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,577
Not sure how you found me.

24
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,346
He's protected, I think,
Mr. Stussy,

25
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,780
possibly even
at the highest levels.

26
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,550
My investigation was kiboshed
last year from DC,

27
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,919
<i>so, we should proceed
with the utmost...</i>

28
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,255
Look, Mr. Dollard.
I don't know what to tell you.

29
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,991
We did have a case
involving Mr. Stussy but...

30
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,327
Well, that case is closed now.

31
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,765
Deputy, I'm looking at evidence
of a vast financial conspiracy

32
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,233
involving blatant tax fraud

33
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,869
and the repurposing of corporate
funds for personal gains.

34
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,304
It looks like,
in the last year,

35
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,941
Mr. Stussy has borrowed
upwards of $200 million

36
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,909
with the sole intent
of lining his pockets

37
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,612
and the pockets of his partners,
a Mr. Sy Feltz

38
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,014
and one V.M. Varga.

39
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,982
Say that name again.

40
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,851
<i>Uh, V.M. Varga?</i>

41
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,754
I'm not sure
what the "V.M." Stands for.

42
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,555
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

43
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,859
Oh, wait. What's your address?

44
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,368
Two hearts,

45
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,639
three clubs, four spades,

46
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,375
five no trump.

47
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,773
Last one.

48
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,112
There.

49
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,615
Well...

50
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,819
You should be happy,
Mr. Stussy.

51
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,323
Your first action item
is complete.

52
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,560
The accumulation of wealth.

53
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm just so tired.

54
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,400
It's perfectly natural.

55
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,002
You see it all the time
in the wild.

56
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,639
The smaller animal going limp
in the jaws of the larger.

57
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,441
Genetic instinct.

58
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,813
At some level,
food knows it's food.

59
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,460
Yes.

60
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,829
Oh...

61
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,966
The strategist. I was
wondering when you might call.

62
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,936
Yes, I have it.

63
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,506
All of it, as long as you
live up to your end of the...

64
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,509
Fine.

65
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,313
The same charming locale?

66
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,052
No, I'm not familiar with that
address but I'm sure I can find it.

67
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,454
Just so you know,

68
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,457
I will be coming
with what in military terms

69
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,793
is referred to as a
"fire team" so no business...

70
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,064
Back up. Back up!

71
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,900
My dear, I'm afraid
you'll have to excuse me.

72
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,536
Don't... don't make me.
I'll shoot.

73
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,042
I am not food.

74
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,812
No, of course not.

75
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,285
You lied to me.

76
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,590
There are no hordes coming.
No mongrel hordes.

77
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,291
It's you! No!

78
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,826
Now, now, now. No.

79
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,695
Now, come on.

80
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,364
Give Mr. Stussy some room.

81
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,467
He's earned the right
to be testy.

82
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,336
After everything
he's been through.

83
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,837
I'm done.

84
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,106
Give me back my papers
and get out!

85
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,911
Are you a fan of progress,
Mr. Stussy?

86
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,515
- Technology?
- No more talking.

87
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,720
You know, in the old days,
only the strong were rich.

88
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,356
It was all a question of
how much you could carry.

89
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,125
But then the Medicis
invented banks,

90
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,895
and wealth and pornography.

91
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,531
This is what
drives innovation.

92
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,667
Of course, technology has
other benefits as well.

93
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:00,438
Safety, for example, a safer car,
the artificial heart.

94
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,744
And, well, how a handgun
might be equipped

95
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,480
with a fingerprint scanner.

96
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,918
To keep it from being used
by anyone but its owner.

97
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,222
That's right.

98
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,791
You can feel it, can't you?

99
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,793
On the grip.

100
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,230
Go on, have a look.

101
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,233
I'll wait.

102
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,971
Progress in all things,
you see.

103
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,650
All right, wipe everything.

104
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,286
We were never here.

105
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,327
- She called?
- Yeah, we have a stop to make.

106
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,984
This is a mistake.

107
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,886
No trace, I'm afraid.

108
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,222
We need those drives.

109
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,973
<i>Vamanos.</i>

110
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,574
Swango.

111
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,412
Swango.

112
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,217
- I'll go.
- No.

113
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,784
<i>El Nino?</i>

114
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,693
Two elevators.

115
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,861
It's yours.

116
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,343
What the shit?

117
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,854
Excuse me.

118
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,456
This is not...
You can't just...

119
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,894
Thank you so much.
Emmit, my dear Emmit.

120
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,796
How are you?

121
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,499
You look...

122
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,901
Well, I know this can't be
easy for you.

123
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,343
You work for Varga.

124
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,880
All this time.

125
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,352
Like a fire door that leads
to another fire.

126
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,424
Emmit, you need to
listen to me very carefully.

127
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:12,596
The Stussy corporation, having sold all
its assets this morning to realignment

128
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:16,500
for $100,000, and may I say,
very generous of you,

129
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,672
but your company is now carrying a debt
load of over three hundred million.

130
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,110
You'll need to file
for chapter 11 immediately.

131
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,912
But don't worry.

132
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,948
Your personal wealth,

133
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,985
the profits you've made
as a partner in this venture,

134
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,855
have all been
carefully hidden. So...

135
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,592
Not all bad.

136
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,800
Mike and Mike
will show you out.

137
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,542
<i>And you're saying
this proves...</i>

138
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,713
Until 18 months ago, Stussy lots was
a traditional real estate concern.

139
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,216
They owned two dozen parcels
around Minnesota,

140
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,151
ground and elevated lots.

141
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,886
They charged
a standard fee for parking,

142
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,421
monthly rates
and hourly meters.

143
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,823
Then the books show
a million dollar loan

144
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,492
from this company
called Narwhal.

145
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,827
As far as I can tell,
the corporate ID number is fake.

146
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,063
So, four months ago,

147
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,832
new incorporation papers
were filed with the city,

148
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:26,737
adding V.M. Varga
as a partner at Stussy lots.

149
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,173
British fella? About six foot?

150
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,908
Country of origin
isn't listed on the form.

151
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,077
But that sounds like the man
that I met.

152
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,079
So, are we talking about
money laundering or...

153
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,514
That's what I thought
at first, but no.

154
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:37,948
This is something different.

155
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,751
It's more of a leveraged
buyout or bleed out,

156
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,754
in which an outside entity
acquires a healthy company,

157
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,423
borrows millions of dollars
in its name,

158
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,124
which is pocketed
by the partners.

159
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,759
Then they sell the company,

160
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,328
now laden with debt,
for a fraction of the price.

161
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,097
And that's a crime?

162
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,132
Not when it's done properly.
No.

163
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,267
What's that?

164
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,469
I was saying, morality aside,

165
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:02,807
one company buying another
and strip-mining it for profit

166
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,110
is perfectly legal as long as one
follows the letter of the law

167
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,145
and pays
the appropriate taxes.

168
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,914
- Which they didn't.
- Correct.

169
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,550
There is evidence that every
dime borrowed by Stussy lots

170
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,485
in the past four months
was funneled into

171
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:18,556
dozens of off-shore accounts in
the name of all three partners.

172
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,624
- Mr. Stussy, Mr. Feltz...
- And this V.M. Varga.

173
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,227
- Who blew in on the wind last year.
- That's how it looks.

174
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,995
Uh...

175
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,730
Oh.

176
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,899
Bur...

177
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,335
Burgle.

178
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,370
What?

179
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,991
We got five bodies
on the third floor.

180
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:58,095
Gunfire in both directions.
Just straight up carnage.

181
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,997
Chief's thinking
an ambush scenario.

182
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,532
Ambush by who?

183
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,871
Don't know him.
But you're gonna recognize the next one.

184
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,507
Told you.

185
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,709
Wait till you see
who we think the target was.

186
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,683
- It was her.
- What was?

187
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,552
Who sent the note to the IRS.

188
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,021
Connecting the dots,
Nikki Swango.

189
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,924
- Why would she?
- They killed her man.

190
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,961
You need to issue a bolo.

191
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,796
What are you gonna do?

192
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,732
Someone's gotta warn Emmit.

193
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,564
What now?

194
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,825
Oh, shit.

195
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,177
Shit!

196
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,312
Fucking...

197
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:57,881
Fuck.

198
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,159
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.

199
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,064
Are you as low as you can go?

200
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,932
What?

201
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,269
I asked if you still feel
you've got room to fall,

202
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,937
or whether this is bottom.

203
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,280
Honestly...

204
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,384
If you'd asked me yesterday,

205
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,521
I'd have said
I couldn't go lower

206
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,222
than sitting in jail,

207
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,760
staring at a life behind bars,
or the electric chair.

208
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,701
But now, here we are today,

209
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,871
lower still.

210
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,543
Oh, I've been watching.

211
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,913
This Varga fellow
plucked you like a chicken.

212
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,083
But he's gone now.

213
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,152
So, I'm gonna finish the job.

214
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,188
Please, wait, I got...

215
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,589
What? Kids?

216
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,958
People who love you?

217
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,394
I don't think
that's true anymore.

218
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,631
Type of man who would
poison his best friend,

219
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,234
kill his own brother.

220
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,402
No.

221
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,903
I didn't... I didn't...

222
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,406
- I didn't mean to...
- Oh, you didn't mean to. Oh.

223
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,775
See you later then.

224
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,748
At least, let me call my wife?

225
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,985
You smashed your phone.

226
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,322
Oh, yeah.

227
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,760
He's a kitten now, Ray.

228
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,295
In case you were wondering.

229
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,030
He's a...

230
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,635
I looked in his eyes.

231
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,171
My Ray.

232
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,674
Who never got to say goodbye.

233
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,311
Who you left bleeding
on the floor,

234
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,381
sadness in his eyes,

235
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,484
your own brother.

236
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:01,999
Do it.

237
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,340
Shoot me.

238
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,077
Put me out of my...

239
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,547
"Though thou exalt thyself
as the eagle,

240
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,716
"and though thou set
thy nest among the stars,

241
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,186
"thence will I bring
thee down, sayeth..."

242
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,253
What?

243
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,557
"Though thou exalt thyself
as the eagle,

244
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,328
"and though thou set
thy nest among the stars,

245
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,832
"thence will I bring
thee down,

246
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,700
"sayeth..."

247
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,670
Shit. Back in your car. Move.

248
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,795
It's not...
We're fine.

249
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,463
Not a parking lot, folks.

250
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,332
- Side of the road.
- I know.

251
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,100
It's kind of a long story,

252
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,936
but in the end of it,
we all go home, so...

253
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,273
Thanks for stopping,
it's real Christian of you.

254
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,955
Step away from the car, ma'am.

255
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,634
Is everything okay, officer?

256
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,937
- License and registration.
- Of course.

257
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,806
You, too, ma'am.

258
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,577
Uh, my purse is in my truck,
you want me to...

259
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,945
Hold on.

260
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,847
There you go.

261
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:04,788
So, it's registered to the company,
but it's my company, so...

262
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,991
Ma'am.

263
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,694
Stay put.

264
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,730
- I'll get the license.
- Officer.

265
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,632
- She's...
- Ma'am.

266
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,769
- I'm serious.
- You should, because she's...

267
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,104
- This is silly, I mean, we're just...
- She's got a gun.

268
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,709
- Sir, step out of the car.
- No.

269
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,177
I'm... she's the one
you should...

270
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,280
Out of the car, now.

271
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,782
Damn it.

272
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,150
Ma'am, do not take
another step.

273
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,519
Honest, listen,
I'm not the...

274
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,989
She's the one, I'm harmless,
you should...

275
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,225
For Christ's sake, shoot her.

276
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,861
Okay, then.

277
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:05,422
So, I've been trying to decide what
to tell you about your grandpa,

278
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,591
his demise, the root cause.

279
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,693
He wasn't really my grandpa.

280
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:13,096
Listen to me, he was one of god's
creatures same as you and me.

281
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,565
And what happened to him,

282
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,101
that should never happen
to anyone.

283
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,803
It was that stoner, you said.

284
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,339
It was and it wasn't.

285
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,507
And I wanna say more, I do,

286
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,411
but there's violence to knowing
the world isn't what you thought.

287
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,081
- And you're just a boy...
- I'm 13 now.

288
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,649
You're still a boy.

289
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,051
You've got your
whole life to be grown,

290
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,853
only a few more years
to be young.

291
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,656
So, for now,

292
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,627
just know that sometimes the world
doesn't make a lot of sense.

293
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,997
But how we get through it is,
we stick together.

294
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,866
- Okay?
- Okay.

295
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,502
Good. Eat your popsicle.

296
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,355
<i>Bless us, Oh Lord,</i>

297
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,790
<i>for this bounty
we're about to receive.</i>

298
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,628
<i>Bless our family and friends.</i>

299
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,635
<i>We've had some dark times
and made mistakes, but...</i>

300
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,307
<i>Now we see the light.</i>

301
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,777
- Amen.
- Amen.

302
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,647
Can you hand me
those carrots there, Stella?

303
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,984
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thanks.

304
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,819
Terrific.

305
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,595
How are you there, friend?

306
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,334
Good as new.

307
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,402
Here you go.

308
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,471
Look at us, together again.

309
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,775
Whoops, the salad.

310
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,276
Oh, shoot, it's in the fridge.

311
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,644
No, I'll go.

312
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,247
You want some?

313
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,785
- Chris honeycomb.
- Gloria Burgle, Minneapolis office.

314
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,020
Are you sure it's him?

315
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,389
Face recognition picked him up
coming in from Brussels.

316
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,291
He's been here overnight.

317
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,263
Oh, that this was
my salvation.

318
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,766
A weary traveler, I.

319
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,005
Agent Burgle, department
of homeland security.

320
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,409
Ah, the nation state
defending its borders.

321
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,578
And me, a simple salesman.

322
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,949
- What do you sell, Mr...
- Rand. Daniel. I sell accounting software.

323
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,418
In Brussels.
Is that where you live?

324
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,786
Good lord, no.

325
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,922
I'm a citizen of the air,
madam.

326
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,158
Moving, always moving.

327
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,928
You don't remember me, do you?

328
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,868
Surmise.

329
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,674
Because I haven't greeted you,
I don't remember you.

330
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,843
Do you?

331
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,348
We may have met once
in my younger days.

332
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,995
Are you familiar with
the Russian saying,

333
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,697
"the past is unpredictable"?

334
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,135
- I'm pretty sure you made that up.
- Possibly.

335
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,806
But which of us can say with
certainty what has occurred,

336
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,642
actually occurred,

337
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:10,246
and what is simply rumor,
misinformation, opinion?

338
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,650
A photograph is considered
proof in a court of law.

339
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,152
Well, photographs
can be doctored.

340
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,987
One's eyes can be deceived.

341
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,723
We see what we believe,
not the other way around.

342
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,560
Six people dead,
including a state trooper.

343
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,765
$200 million unaccounted for.
Those are facts.

344
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,067
And you at the heart
of the morass.

345
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,403
What else
am I supposed to see?

346
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,043
A man wakes up one morning
and decides to kill

347
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:43,680
four men over a certain age,
all with the same last name.

348
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,583
That didn't happen.

349
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:52,021
And yet,
if evidence is collected,

350
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,223
if confessions are made,

351
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:57,360
if a verdict of guilty
is entered in a court of law,

352
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,196
then its happening becomes
as the rocks and rivers,

353
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:05,101
and to argue that it didn't happen
is to argue with reality itself.

354
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,873
Did you know
Emmit Stussy was murdered?

355
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,742
Three months ago.

356
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,644
Killed in his own home.

357
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,781
Pitchfork peasants.

358
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,185
- What?
- I said,

359
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,955
it is a dangerous world
for men of standing.

360
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:33,396
Human beings, you see, have no inherent
value other than the money they earn.

361
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,398
Cats have value, for example,

362
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,401
because they provide pleasure
to the humans.

363
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,803
But a deadbeat on welfare?

364
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,140
Well, they have
negative value.

365
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,509
So, ipso facto,

366
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:50,346
Emmit's death is more tragic
than the death of a wasteling.

367
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,819
That's...

368
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,422
You can't believe that.

369
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,357
Oh, it's true.

370
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,527
It's true whether
I believe it or not.

371
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,663
Did you kill him?

372
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,632
Emmit?

373
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,669
From Brussels?

374
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,340
They got phones in Belgium,
yeah? E-mail?

375
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,844
Mr. Varga.

376
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,453
You're asking me if there
are phones in Belgium?

377
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,062
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen next.

378
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,565
Three agents
from homeland security

379
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:45,134
are gonna put handcuffs on you
and take you to rikers.

380
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,603
And then we're gonna charge you
with felony money laundering

381
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,373
and six counts of conspiracy
to commit murder.

382
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,143
And then I'm gonna go home to my son,
it's his birthday tomorrow.

383
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,312
I promised I'd take him
to the state fair.

384
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,747
You ever guess a pig's weight?

385
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:59,649
Or eat a deep fried
Snickers bar?

386
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:05,988
There's no better way to spend a Saturday
in this, our great American experiment.

387
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:14,263
So, while you're eating mashed
potatoes from a box in a dark room,

388
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,833
think of me among
the Amber waves of grain.

389
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,341
No.

390
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,847
That's not what's
gonna happen next.

391
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,183
What's gonna
happen next is this.

392
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,788
In five minutes
that door is going to open,

393
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,692
and a man you can't argue with
will tell me

394
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,193
I'm free to go.

395
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,863
And I will stand
from this chair

396
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:50,600
and disappear into the world,
so help me god.

397
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,078
Rikers and Snickers bars.

398
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,380
You'll see.

399
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,452
Agent Burgle.

400
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,789
Gloria.

401
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,960
Trust me.

402
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,063
The future is certain.

403
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,667
And when it comes,
you will know without question,

404
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,836
your place in the world.

405
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,306
Until then, we've said
all there is to say.

406
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,144
Any further debate would be
simply wasting our breath.

407
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:39,815
And if there's one thing
I can't abide, it's waste.

408
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,629
Goodbye.
