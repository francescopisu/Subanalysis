1
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,890
Good.

2
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,890
Good.

3
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,390
Honestly buck
it's a little embarrassing.

4
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,630
I mean we called the number.

5
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,460
They said if there
was ever a problem

6
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,300
we should call the number,
and well we called it.

7
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,430
And?

8
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,400
A series of
clicks and buzzers.

9
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,000
A series of...

10
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,470
clicks and buzzers.

11
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
That's what we got, which...

12
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
couldn't even leave a message.

13
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,310
No message possible.

14
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,410
So we thought...

15
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,410
we thought get
buck back in here,

16
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,580
after all he vouched for him.

17
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,750
Well now, let's be,
let's call a spade a spade.

18
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,755
I don't know him,
don't vouch for him.

19
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,560
I was just a conduit
for information.

20
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,960
Like you said "buck we tried
all the normal channels,

21
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,000
"and we just need
a bridge loan to..."

22
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,500
It was last year
for Pete's sake.

23
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,930
I met him at the shriner's.

24
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,000
Sure, okay then.

25
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,440
Everything went great when
we met with the broker,

26
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,170
Mr Ehrmantraut, if I'm not a-

27
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,595
right, Rick Ehrmantraut.

28
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,010
I got his card in my...

29
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,140
and now we're in
the black again,

30
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,310
so we called the number
to arrange payback

31
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,620
and clicks and buzzers.

32
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,520
Maybe there's another
number, we're thinking.

33
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,050
Another number where we can
at least leave a darn message.

34
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,920
It's a lot of money.

35
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,690
And it's just sitting
there on the books which...

36
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,530
can't have that.

37
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,630
Okay then well,

38
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,200
thanks for coming in.

39
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,270
Of course.

40
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,870
And did you think
about what I asked?

41
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,745
The widow goldfarb
she wants to meet.

42
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,610
- The who?
- I was gonna tell ya.

43
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,765
She's the so called storage
queen, sniffing around

44
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,920
for a possible silent
partner type arrangement.

45
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
Seems
like the real deal.

46
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,190
Money to burn.

47
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,420
Where was she two years ago?

48
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,500
Friends, friends and Dave.

49
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,565
I'm not lying when I tell ya,

50
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:13,400
I still remember the first date.

51
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,670
25 years ago.

52
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,040
Took her to fjords in
St. Paul, my Stella.

53
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,540
I brought her a lobster
the size of a car.

54
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,580
Cost me two weeks
wages at the red Robin,

55
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,020
but it was worth it.

56
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,520
And so over shellfish she
says "where do you live?"

57
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,225
You know, just
making conversation

58
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,762
and I tell her the
address 213 Monroe.

59
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:41,300
And she gets this
funny look on her face.

60
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,930
And she says "which apartment?"

61
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,100
So I say "16."

62
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,870
And now the look gets even
funnier and she says...

63
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,740
I say "what are the odds?"

64
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,980
I lived in that same apartment
for three and a half years,

65
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,480
I still had the key.

66
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,350
Of course she
never told me that part.

67
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,480
So I come home a week
later and what the heck?

68
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,420
She'd moved in!

69
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,860
And now somehow it's 25
years later and here we are.

70
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,330
And we've got grace
and her husband DEnnis.

71
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,240
And life has been to
us, more than good.

72
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,480
- Okay.
- Raise a glass to my Stella.

73
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,520
Still lovely as the day we met.

74
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,580
Stella.

75
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,090
Thank you.

76
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,545
Enjoy
yourselves come on.

77
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,830
I got you five minutes.

78
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,430
Go get him tiger.

79
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Yeah.

80
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,410
How we doing?

81
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,180
Good to see you,
thanks for coming.

82
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,040
Ray.

83
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,400
You know, congratulations
and all that.

84
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,140
Thanks.

85
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,670
Place looks good.

86
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,280
We had the floors re-done.

87
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
Oh ya.
That's, uh...

88
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,885
So you said grace got a...

89
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,620
that's her, her husband now?

90
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,420
Dennis.

91
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,970
There was nothing.

92
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,520
Barely even a wedding.

93
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,530
We did in Cabo on a beach.

94
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,830
They said, invitation
said "no shoes."

95
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,130
Imagine wearing a
suit and no shoes.

96
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,230
Still real nice.

97
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,700
But small, only
like 10 people.

98
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
Ah but you went?

99
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,810
We had some meetings.

100
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,040
The next day.

101
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
Potential investors.

102
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,240
In Cabo?

103
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,110
It's like a resort,
super high end.

104
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,650
International
businessmen and the like.

105
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,020
Exclusive.

106
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,550
Not for parole
officers you mean.

107
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Don't take offense.

108
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,890
Ya, Ray.
Geez, don't take offense.

109
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,330
We're just explaining
what happened.

110
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,670
How's the Corvette?

111
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,970
It's a car.

112
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,640
Look I'm getting engaged.

113
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,140
Again?

114
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,280
Don't say that.

115
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,310
I'm sorry I just...

116
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,030
she's real sweet, Nikki.

117
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,655
We're in, you know...

118
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:23,280
you meet her at work?

119
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,420
At work yeah.

120
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,960
So, embezzler?

121
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,500
Drug mule?

122
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,600
Why is he here?

123
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,740
He doesn't need to be here.

124
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
Sy's always here when the
conversations about money.

125
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,940
That's what this is right?

126
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,100
A conversation about money?

127
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,450
I wanna buy her a ring.

128
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,250
So, serious.

129
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,780
And the way I figure it,

130
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,240
is you still owe me from...
- I owe you?

131
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,890
From what happened
when we were kids.

132
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,060
Well now Ray, that's...

133
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,295
I gotta say, your math
seems shaky there.

134
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,800
I mean, after the, what
was it last quarter,

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,850
we fronted you 850
for car repairs.

136
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,625
On top of co-signing
your mortgage

137
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:13,200
so you could get your apartment.

138
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,340
Not that I mind,
happy to help really.

139
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,040
But where does it...

140
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,675
see that's not
the way I see it.

141
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,310
That's you paying me back for...

142
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,310
Ray.

143
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,880
The thing is Ray, even
if we wanted to, we're...

144
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,450
what sy's saying is,
it's not the best time.

145
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,380
Huh.

146
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,160
How about you just
give me back my stamp

147
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,160
and we'll call it square.

148
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,190
Ray.

149
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,215
No, I'm talking to my brother.

150
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,230
Look, you are lucky I don't sue.

151
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,840
I mean, a legal document
which delineates things.

152
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,840
Bequeaths them to
specific parties.

153
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,210
A father, dead in a driveway.

154
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,840
An older boy taking advantage
of a younger playing...

155
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,510
nobody took advantage.

156
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,010
It was a trade.

157
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,020
If I had a time machine, you'd
see I'd play back the tape.

158
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,770
"Emmit come on, I'm begging ya.

159
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,520
"Take the stupid stamps already.

160
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,590
"Give me the car."

161
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,790
No, that's not, that
was you tricking me.

162
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,720
Ray.

163
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,030
How much did you
get for them anyway?

164
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,260
The whole collection?

165
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,100
I never asked.

166
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,430
What two, three dozen stamps?

167
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,370
Vintage.

168
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,870
- Ray.
- No.

169
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,970
She's a nice girl, a catch.

170
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,280
And she deserves a
sweet ring, pricey, so...

171
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,880
Are you gonna do
what's right here?

172
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,450
Are you gonna do what's right?

173
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,320
What happened?

174
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,720
Did you get it?

175
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,130
I need a real drink.

176
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,770
Here's the er...

177
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,370
it's not the best time.

178
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,070
He said.

179
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
Don't worry, I'm gonna...

180
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,410
I'll handle it.

181
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,670
Ray?

182
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,370
Sorry.

183
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,595
No tip?

184
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:54,860
Ya.

185
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,660
Get a real job.

186
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,100
so then we use the dentist coup
or play a canapé.

187
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,000
And watch out
for the Cuthberts,

188
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,430
I don't think that
cough of his is real.

189
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,670
Whatever happens don't
let the Swedes force

190
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,140
the trump check again.

191
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,670
Babe?
- What?

192
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,940
I'm talking about the
wildcat regional on Thursday.

193
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,150
Top three mixed pairs
we qualify

194
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,480
for the Upper Wisconsin semi
professional next month.

195
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,170
Which top three in that, the
sport really opens up for us.

196
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,860
Now hun, you know you're not
supposed to leave the state.

197
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,420
I know but
couldn't you fix it?

198
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,030
I mean as po isn't there
a form you could sign?

199
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,200
Well see there's
a lot of sticky.

200
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,500
I mean, with the first being,

201
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,870
technically we're not supposed
to be, you know, dating.

202
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,240
And I'm saying it's mission
critical to keep that a secret.

203
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,070
So when it comes to
signing official forms,

204
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,140
I mean, talk about
showing your cards.

205
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,680
What are you saying?

206
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,850
No, just as to the legalities.

207
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,535
I mean parolee,
parole officer et cetera.

208
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,220
I mean, we're right
on the line here.

209
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,160
There's big money
to be won hun.

210
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,260
I know.

211
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,730
I'm not just talking
a few regionals.

212
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,390
We get ourselves on the map,

213
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,050
bridge wise locally
in the next few months

214
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,900
and I'm talking
sponsorship opportunities

215
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,370
bordering on six figures.

216
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,570
Then we don't need to borrow
money from your stupid brother

217
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,200
or nobody else.

218
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,240
Right?

219
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,380
Yeah.

220
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,810
Baby look at me.

221
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,250
We're a team you and me.

222
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,320
Simpatico to the
point of spooky.

223
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,990
Like how I always know
when you're gonna lead

224
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,860
with a hard or
backwards finesse.

225
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
And you got that
putter's instinct

226
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,800
for when to drop the Marie
Applebaum discovery play.

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,370
That's true.

228
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,700
You're the hand
and I'm the glove.

229
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,270
You're the bottle
and I'm the beer.

230
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,595
Or the beer and
the glass in my case.

231
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,110
Oh yeah, but i
mean it comes in...

232
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,580
I know.

233
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,780
Yeah.

234
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,460
Simpatico.

235
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,135
That's weird huh?

236
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:25,070
There's a sensor.

237
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,130
You ready?

238
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,630
Yeah.

239
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,380
See you tonight pops?

240
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,810
If macaroni and cheese
don't float your boat,

241
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,850
might as well stay home.

242
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,780
so what happened?

243
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,430
What could I do?

244
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,900
The land was fallow
and we needed grain.

245
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,570
The land was what?

246
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,425
I didn't even know
that was illegal,

247
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,660
'cause who makes
the laws anyway.

248
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,930
Person in her own home,
on her own property,

249
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,690
I mean short of murder,

250
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,060
shouldn't you be able to, you
know, just about anything?

251
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,855
Maurice?

252
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,797
Maurice?

253
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,540
Huh?

254
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
You blew your piss test pal.

255
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,365
Oh bummer.

256
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:29,550
Look...

257
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,650
thing like that, normally
that gets you right away revoked

258
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,590
but I thought call him up,
see what he has to say.

259
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,730
Cool.

260
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,660
Hey, why are we
meeting in a bar?

261
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,615
I mean not in your office.

262
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,000
Hey, I was drinking that.

263
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,080
Let's cut to the quick here.

264
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,880
Your last stretch
was six and a half

265
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,615
for breaking into
rich folks' digs

266
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,350
and stealing their flat screens.

267
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,600
Allegedly.

268
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,650
No moron.

269
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,320
How it works is when
they convict you,

270
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,490
it turns into a fact.

271
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,160
Now look, I gotta,
i gotta pla...

272
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,830
hey! Dickhead!

273
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,930
Huh?

274
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,835
I gotta place, turns out a
place that needs some robbing.

275
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:21,740
A little robbing, not wholesale
burglary, just a specific...

276
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,540
just looking for a certain item.

277
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,970
And if you do it,
well let's just say

278
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,040
your little problem
goes up in smoke.

279
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,250
What are we talking about?

280
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,585
A stamp.

281
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,920
A stamp?

282
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,330
Like a...

283
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,330
Postage stamp?

284
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

285
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,770
Cool.
Cool.

286
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,400
So I mean, I know
I'm the moron but...

287
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,775
it's not that kind
of stamp numb nuts.

288
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,340
It's a vintage stamp,
it's got you know,

289
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,080
sentimental value for me.

290
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,980
It's my stamp.

291
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,680
Your stamp.

292
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,620
But it's, you know, at someone
else's house temporarily.

293
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,750
Cool, cool.

294
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,920
So why not just ask for it back?

295
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,360
Well it's, you know, complicated.

296
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,800
Just get the damn stamp.

297
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,970
What's cooking?

298
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,180
You need to come down here.

299
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,660
Nine o'clock at night isn't it?

300
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,140
Er number, ticks and buzzers.

301
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,250
He came.

302
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,350
Who?

303
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,650
Well now, the fella from the...

304
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,720
Ehrmantraut?

305
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,020
No, different fella.

306
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,260
Don't wanna say too
much on the phone just...

307
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,990
you better come down here.

308
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,130
Everything okay?

309
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,800
Gotta go to the office hun.

310
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,040
Hun?

311
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,440
You're in your house shoes.

312
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,810
Good call.

313
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,780
you ever think about how
they never put the morgue

314
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,850
on the top floor of a hospital?

315
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,720
I notice stuff like that.

316
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,355
It's always in the basement.

317
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:59,460
It's like its own elevator.

318
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,830
<i>And...</i>

319
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,660
<i>How does that
make you feel?</i>

320
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,360
Huh? No.

321
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,270
You asked me how I define
the person called me.

322
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,370
And I'm saying, I'm always
having thoughts of...

323
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,240
What do ya?

324
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,040
Insightful.

325
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,220
For example, where does the
President of United States

326
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,350
buy his clothes?

327
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,350
Do they shut down like
a whole JC Penny?

328
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,960
Just so he can try on a suit.

329
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,830
<i>There's a tailor,
he comes to the white house.</i>

330
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,670
Now see, I didn't know that.

331
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,170
<i>Let's focus.</i>

332
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,540
<i>So when you say your parole
officer was mean to you before,</i>

333
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,440
<i>how did that make you feel?</i>

334
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,980
You know, just not good, you know.

335
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,420
I mean here I am,
I'm trying, you know.

336
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,190
Not hurting anybody, anymore.

337
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,520
So...

338
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,790
<i>Are you getting high?</i>

339
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,060
No.

340
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,330
Oh shit.

341
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,170
<i>Maurice?</i>

342
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,140
Ah hell.

343
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,540
No, no, no, no!

344
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,480
Goddammit.
Son of a bitch.

345
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,470
What the shit?

346
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,410
God blast.

347
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,320
Ah screw it, I remember.

348
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,530
I put him in your office.

349
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,330
Oh geez.
Who?

350
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,470
Didn't get a name.

351
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,870
Here from the lender he said.

352
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,470
I told him it was late, but
he just got off a plane so...

353
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
hey there.

354
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,950
Emmit Stussy, thanks for a...

355
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,050
well.

356
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,050
Honestly we didn't know
if our message had...

357
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,020
you called the number?

358
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,425
Ya, like I said we didn't...

359
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,242
all you get when call...

360
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,121
clicks and buzzers.

361
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,010
Which, hard to leave a

362
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,705
But good news, you're here

363
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,200
and we're in the black now.

364
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,740
Stussy Corp and well your
firm was nice enough to...

365
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,240
Mr Ehrmantraut, your broker,

366
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,340
he arranged for your firm to
lend us that money last year.

367
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,440
We're happy to say we're
ready to pay it back in full.

368
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,180
That's alright.

369
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm sorry.

370
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,380
You keep it.

371
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,425
Keep it?

372
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,660
Yeah.

373
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,860
I apologize, I
didn't catch your name.

374
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,030
I'm V.M. Varga.

375
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,330
And you work for...

376
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,930
with Narwhal yes.

377
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,100
Well now.

378
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,710
It's, see your firm, Narwhal,

379
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,570
like I said last year,

380
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,140
we borrowed a hefty sum.

381
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,610
And I know you're
not bona fide FDIC,

382
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,550
but I mean, unless you boys
do business differently in...

383
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,620
Where you from?

384
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,190
America.

385
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,330
Well in America normally
when you lend somebody money...

386
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,550
if that were us, he's
saying, in your shoes,

387
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,770
well I'd expect the
money back with interest.

388
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,100
Which we're happy to...

389
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,370
like I say we got it.

390
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,010
Just need to know where
to send the check.

391
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,280
Or a wire transfer if you...

392
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,340
exactly just give us the digits.

393
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,980
Investment.

394
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,120
One more time?

395
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,290
Well you called it a loan,

396
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,790
it wasn't a loan,
it was an investment.

397
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,960
We are investors.

398
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,690
Investors?

399
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,930
The problem I think,
is you're confusing the word

400
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,800
singularity with
the word continuity.

401
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,440
What's that now?

402
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,940
The word begin and the
word end, are these the same?

403
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,910
No but...

404
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,950
then why talk about
ending something

405
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,010
that's only just begun.

406
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,850
See now, the document
we signed last year...

407
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,060
when we met with your broker.

408
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

409
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,990
Buck Olander introduced us
and he said, your broker...

410
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,260
we were very specific
about a short term...

411
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,130
and nowhere in the document
did it say anything about,

412
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,140
and believe me, I'm a
lawyer, so you know,

413
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,900
I vetted it very...

414
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,040
a document is just a piece of paper.

415
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,740
Legally binding actually.

416
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,010
A contract.

417
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,450
To be clear, you had a
problem as you said last year.

418
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,650
The real estate business,
well this a bad business.

419
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,890
So you tried the normal
channels, the banks,

420
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,030
but you're companies still
failing so you come to us.

421
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,160
For a loan.

422
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,305
You never thought to
ask why we might lend you

423
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,640
one million dollars with
no collateral required?

424
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,010
See, no, we were
under the impression...

425
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,450
our fundamentals are strong.

426
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,480
Our holdings...

427
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,620
my point is that was the
time for questions yes.

428
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,250
Not this.

429
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,130
Now we've taken the past
year to study your business.

430
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,290
Properties, cash flow,

431
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,530
so we can better
disguise our activities.

432
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,480
Look, we just wanna pay
the money back and you know,

433
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,280
be on our way.

434
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,750
As I said, the first
sum was an investment

435
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,720
for you to keep.

436
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,750
All future funds will be run
through the front office,

437
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,920
the same as other Stussy income.

438
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,430
A few thousand a
month, more or less,

439
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,580
now I can get you the
specs and instructions.

440
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,730
We'll have to account for
the comings and goings

441
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,630
in your software.

442
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,670
We already have access to your...

443
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,310
to your system.

444
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,280
So we can monitor your activity.

445
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,550
Make sure you're adjusting.

446
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,150
And it goes without saying,

447
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,530
you're not to mention
this to anybody.

448
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,460
Happy Birthday or whatever.

449
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,610
Uh, cool.

450
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,810
The trash is under
the sink, if you hate it.

451
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,730
No it's...

452
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,290
What is it?

453
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,650
It's nothing.

454
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,680
Just a dumb thing I made.

455
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,625
Something special
for the clean plate club.

456
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:50,760
I told you, I don't
like strawberries.

457
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,930
More for me then.

458
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,330
So the thinking is
absorb the local precinct

459
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,400
into the larger county force.

460
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,570
Leaving you Jack shit.

461
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,670
Language?

462
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,670
No, I'd still be highest
ranking local officer just not...

463
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,830
chief.

464
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,980
Right.

465
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,840
What'd you get there?

466
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,480
A model grandpa made me.

467
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,580
Like I said, it's
a stupid carving.

468
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,320
Remember when the
time we went camping.

469
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,340
So don't forget you're
at your dad's this weekend.

470
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,360
He and Dale are gonna
take you to the symphony.

471
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,130
So is Dale my other dad now?

472
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,370
Well no.

473
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,130
I mean he and your dad haven't
been together that long.

474
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,740
But if they got married.

475
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,090
Not legal.

476
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,240
Is it two men?

477
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,070
If they did, well you know
how Ennis is my stepfather,

478
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,540
married my mom after
grandpa passed.

479
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,880
I guess Dale would
become your stepfather.

480
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,180
I think.

481
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,900
I honestly don't know how it works.

482
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,620
I know how it
works in the Bible.

483
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,860
Another beer pops?

484
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,430
Now you're speaking English.

485
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,720
Swango and Stussy.

486
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,140
hello boys.

487
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,015
dummy.

488
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:06,650
Sorry.

489
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,220
You're the dummy.

490
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,790
Right yeah.

491
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,370
Okay, I got this.

492
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,450
Guy's name was Stussy
on something Lane.

493
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,980
Midnight Lane?

494
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:43,890
Ah hell, it was erm,
was it midnight, no.

495
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,900
And the town was ah goddammit.

496
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,570
And the town was
something biblical

497
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,980
like Eden village or Eden...

498
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,680
Eden Valley.

499
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,520
Triple goddam bingo.

500
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,220
Night pops.

501
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,995
Can I run the siren?

502
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,830
Once, on the highway.

503
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,800
Hey you got a phonebook?

504
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,270
Ya.

505
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,840
Can I borrow it?

506
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,110
No.

507
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,460
What do you mean no?

508
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,610
Gotta buy something.

509
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,050
I'm not buying anything,
just give me the phone book.

510
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,120
No.

511
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,180
- Give the phone book.
- No.

512
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,750
Give me the damn phone book.

513
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,230
Okay.

514
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,900
Stussy, hot damn.

515
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,070
Hey.

516
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,640
That's a public book you know.

517
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,440
You see now that
always make me feel queer

518
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,940
reading in the car.

519
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,820
What'd you think about that
model your grandpa made ya?

520
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,420
Pretty sweet huh.

521
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,460
He's a good guy.

522
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,490
I know he drinks too much,

523
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,930
but I think deep
down we've all of us

524
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,630
got something positive
inside us, don't cha think?

525
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,470
What's going on?

526
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,470
It's the model.
I left the model.

527
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,470
Hun.

528
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,210
It's late, swing by
in the morning

529
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,310
and maybe pick it up huh.

530
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,410
No, he made it for me.

531
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,410
I have to...

532
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,680
okay.

533
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,920
Okay, let me flip a b-ward.

534
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,780
Back in a sec.

535
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,700
Ennis?

536
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,020
Oh geez, I better...

537
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,370
Ennis?

538
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,790
Mom?

539
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,460
Go outside!
Go outside now!

540
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,130
Leave.
- Mom!

541
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,840
Lock the door.

542
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,340
Call Donny and tell him
to radio the state police.

543
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,640
I'm gonna search the
rest of the house.

544
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,670
No, no mom!

545
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,880
I gotta, I'm chief.

546
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,110
Like I said lock the door.

547
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,010
If you see anyone you
lean on the horn okay.

548
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,010
Anybody tries for you,

549
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,410
use the pepper spray
just like I taught you,

550
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,980
it's in the glove.

551
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,530
he was looking for something.

552
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,580
What the...?

553
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,540
Huh.

554
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,720
What the heck?

555
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,010
Third place.

556
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,880
I know.

557
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,280
We played so good.

558
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,550
I know it was amazing.

559
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,450
So good

560
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,020
Oh my god, I am so proud of you.

561
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,120
You made such a good job of it.

562
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,890
You're last hands,
you played those cards

563
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,390
and you were on fire.

564
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,570
this is nice.

565
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,770
Huh?

566
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,370
Oh, yeah, amazing.

567
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,940
Third runner up,
wildcat regionals.

568
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,080
Just posted it to my Facebook.

569
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,750
We played good.

570
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,280
We didn't just play good.

571
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,320
That hand I got, ten hearts,
that doesn't just happen.

572
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,650
That's, what have
you, fate or luck.

573
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,060
Plus my steely gaze.

574
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,690
Striking fear into the
hearts of the elderly.

575
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:30,095
I'm proud of you mister.

576
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:32,462
You really, you focused.

577
00:52:32,662 --> 00:52:34,830
It's like I said, simpatico.

578
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,740
Third runner up.

579
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,310
In the Olympics that's bronze.

580
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:43,310
Now see, that's
the kind of thinking

581
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,550
that's gonna take us
straight to the top.

582
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh.

583
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,370
So, I got it Ray.

584
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,770
I did.

585
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,705
But I won't lie,
it didn't go smooth.

586
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:17,677
Ray, there's a
man in my bathroom.

587
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:20,450
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

588
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,480
Are you saying he's not a
man or he's not in my bathroom?

589
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
I'm saying,
I can explain.

590
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,550
There was some
acting required,

591
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,990
in throwing the gas station
attendant off my scent but...

592
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,110
there's no smoking in here.

593
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,030
Also, if I'm being honest.

594
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,260
I sure hope that that
fella with the stamps

595
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,045
wasn't a friend of yours Ray.

596
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:40,830
'Cause well, let's just say...

597
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,000
when an ex-con threatens
ya, demands the goods.

598
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,410
The smart money says co-operate.

599
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,040
That wasn't part of the...

600
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,950
nobody said anything
about hurting...

601
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,080
Ray!

602
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,820
Look at me, what did you do?

603
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,180
Nothing.
Just give me a second.

604
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,770
Hey! Shitbird!

605
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,550
What did you do?

606
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,420
Nothing, just what ya asked.

607
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,550
Drove out to Eden Valley and
robbed your guy, the rich one.

608
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,870
Although I gotta say the
place wasn't exactly a palace.

609
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,305
- Prairie.
- Come again?

610
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:18,540
- Eden prairie.
- Huh?

611
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,890
Ray, did you hire
one your parolees

612
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,240
to steal money
from your brother?

613
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,610
No.

614
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,315
Not money.

615
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:28,950
Just...

616
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,320
Just taking back what's mine.

617
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,690
The stamp.

618
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:34,790
I told you that,

619
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,390
how he bamboozled me out
of a fortune and I just...

620
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,675
all these years I just...

621
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,960
Let it go, but no more.

622
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,500
You need a ring.

623
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,300
This is our time.

624
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,340
That is so...

625
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,870
Romantic.

626
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,540
Come here.

627
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,650
That is so sweet.

628
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,720
Although I gotta say,

629
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,990
brother must have been
from another mother

630
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,710
'cause man was he old.

631
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,230
What are talking about?

632
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:22,900
What matters is, is
I go what you asked.

633
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,770
And now you can, we can tear
up the piss test and you can...

634
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,680
I should probably get
out of town for a while.

635
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,480
If I'm being honest given
the level of uncooperation

636
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,015
and consequences thereof.

637
00:55:36,215 --> 00:55:37,350
What the shit is this?

638
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,680
It's, what are
ya, it's stamps.

639
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,070
What did you do?

640
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,090
Listen, don't be...

641
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,360
putting your hands on me,

642
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,460
you're raising the
tone of your voice,

643
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,330
not after the night I had.

644
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,930
You didn't, do...

645
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,960
the risk I took
on account of you.

646
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,235
Your needs.

647
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:55,500
Emmit Stussy.

648
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,000
Eden Prairie,
it's a short drive.

649
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,505
I wrote it down.

650
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:02,810
No you said...

651
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,340
look I did what you said.

652
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,310
The address on the Eden
Valley, I looked it up.

653
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:09,510
And now...

654
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,220
I'm out of pocket here Ray.

655
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,190
I've got...

656
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,190
I think I covered my
tracks pretty good.

657
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,290
And look, since you touched me,

658
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,030
I'm gonna have to
demand a dollar value.

659
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,460
Five thousand.

660
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,900
Which is more than fair,
considering the fella we robbed

661
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,400
is probably dead.

662
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,600
What's your name handsome?

663
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,660
Well now, I'm not
sure I should tell ya.

664
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,010
On account of I've
gotta think about

665
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,850
covering my tracks here.

666
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,020
Darling I've seen your face.

667
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,190
And Ray knows your name so...

668
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,460
it's Maurice.

669
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,730
Okay Maurice,

670
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,170
you get me a towel

671
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,900
and maybe we can discuss
this in the living room,

672
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,040
like civilized people.

673
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,040
Ray...

674
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,210
The gun.

675
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,050
You tricked me.

676
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,220
You got...

677
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,290
I'm giving ya 'til
tomorrow to get my money.

678
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,530
Five thousand.

679
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,170
Otherwise, well maybe
I turn you into the cops.

680
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,500
Or shoot ya, or her.

681
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,540
Robbing your own brother.

682
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,680
That's just low.

683
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,820
You don't tell
Maurice what to do.

684
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,090
Now hun, let me explain.

685
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,000
Hun?

686
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,730
Hun?

687
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,600
Three floors,
10 seconds per floor.

688
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,200
Hun, what are you?

689
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,210
Cross the front hall,
eight seconds.

690
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,060
- Babe.
- Not now.

691
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,480
Hun what are...

692
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,500
quiet, I'm counting.

693
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,520
21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

694
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,790
27, 28, 29, 30.

695
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:37,130
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

696
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:41,300
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

697
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,090
41, 42, 43, 44,

698
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,880
45, 46, 47, 48, 49,

699
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,010
50.

700
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,610
Can you believe this guy?

701
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,210
I gave him a simple...

702
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,650
I even wrote down the damn...

703
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,150
and now just my...

704
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,060
just my damn luck.

705
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,390
64, 65, 66.

706
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,990
Ah suck off.

707
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,330
67, 68, 69, 70.

708
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,820
- Son of a bastard.
- 7172, 73, 74.

709
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,310
- Short drive my ass.
- 75, 76.

710
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,910
Is he out?

711
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:23,880
What?

712
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,180
The other window,
do you see him?

713
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,080
ya.
He's coming hurry.

714
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,220
Did you see that?

715
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,090
Oh my god.

716
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,430
Get down, or someone'll see.

717
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,970
I mean right in the...

718
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,170
no way...

719
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,450
he came over.

720
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,000
Holy shit.

721
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,680
What are you?

722
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,450
Yes 911.

723
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,550
There's been an accident,
on the sidewalk,

724
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,520
the air conditioner.

725
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,380
Get dressed you've gotta go.

726
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:14,320
What?

727
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,650
Oh thank god.

728
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,220
It's 940 Hannover Street,
hurry please.

729
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,760
It was an accident.

730
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,530
I've been trying to get the
landlord to take that unit out

731
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,930
for like six weeks,
it's on record.

732
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,730
And tonight I don't know, it
must have come loose somehow.

733
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,310
You're his parole officer,
you can't be here.

734
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:37,280
Ya but...

735
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,480
what happens when?

736
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,980
I gave a fake name
when I rented the place.

737
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:40,880
I got ID.

738
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,850
Now that's...

739
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,150
babe, that's a violation
of your probation.

740
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,150
Ray?

741
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,420
Oh right yeah.

742
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,490
Good call.

743
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,590
We'll talk about this later.

744
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,160
You, you're sexy.

745
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,960
Yes officer,
I'll stay on the line.

746
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,400
Don't forget the stamps.

747
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,300
What?

748
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,855
The stamps.

749
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,410
Stamps, yeah.

750
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,410
Burn 'em, okay.

751
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,950
Okay.

752
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,490
I love you.

753
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,750
Baby you have no idea.

754
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,790
Yes I hear the sirens.

755
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,040
Thank you.

756
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,290
Back stairs.

757
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,970
Yes, I'll hold.

758
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,330
your dad's here.

759
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,580
You take him Dale's,
I'm not sure how long...

760
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,010
Whatever you need.

761
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,850
I already turned the
lights on in his room.

762
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,450
I wanna stay with mom.

763
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,450
No hun, mommy's
gotta work now.

764
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,600
let's say no school
tomorrow, huh?

765
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,370
Yeah.

766
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,555
Now I get it.

767
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:19,190
Ah, geeze!
