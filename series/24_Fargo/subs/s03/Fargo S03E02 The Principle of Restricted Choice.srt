1
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,059
Mom?

2
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,028
Right.

3
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,457
Jeez.

4
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,719
Hey, chief.

5
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,488
Thought we said 9:00.

6
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,791
Yeah.

7
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,726
But new chief showed up early.

8
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,496
Wants to gather the department
together first thing.

9
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,164
So, since the department
is you and me,

10
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,832
I figured
I'd come and get you.

11
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,300
- Ooh, is that coffee?
- Mmm.

12
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,309
Is that the box
you took from Ennis'?

13
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,377
Uh-huh.

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,413
Nathan at his dad's?

15
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,381
Hopefully.

16
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,719
Oh.

17
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,489
Do you think
this Thaddeus Mobley fella

18
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,991
had something to
do with the murder?

19
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,560
I should say so,

20
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,997
seeing as how Ennis Stussy

21
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,065
and this Thaddeus Mobley
are one and the same.

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,067
Come again?

23
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,539
How's it you're in
my kitchen again?

24
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,575
Oh, the chief...
Well, the new chief.

25
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,545
Oh, right. The department.

26
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,082
Well...

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,718
Let's go see
if I still have a job.

28
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,278
You going by
the autopsy later?

29
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,180
They glued
his nose and mouth shut.

30
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,150
Are we thinking cause of death
is somehow a cliffhanger?

31
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,585
Guess not.

32
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,720
Did you canvass the local?

33
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,056
Any reports of
strange customers?

34
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,557
Well, Earl at the gas n go

35
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,359
intimated he might
have had a weird one.

36
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,427
Weird how?

37
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,729
Uh, Ron? It's... hello?

38
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,931
- <i>Hello.</i>
- It's me.

39
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,066
<i>Hello?</i>

40
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,202
- Ron? Can you hear me?
<i>- Is this you, Gloria?</i>

41
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,705
I wanted to check on Nathan,
make sure he was getting...

42
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,073
<i>Ah, I can't quite hear you.</i>

43
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,774
- Ron, it's Gloria.
<i>- Hello?</i>

44
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,576
- Hold on, I'll call you...
<i>- What's that?</i>

45
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,245
Gosh.

46
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,679
Does yours do that?

47
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,747
Who?

48
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,915
Every time I make a call,

49
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,850
it's like
I'm in a silent movie.

50
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,483
Hold up, forgot my gun.

51
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,329
I'm here, right? You see me.

52
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,964
Is that a trick question?

53
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,310
<i>"Keep it."</i>

54
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,178
That's what he said.

55
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,348
This V.M. Varga?

56
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,984
Yes. And we should have...

57
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,652
At the time when
we needed the loan,

58
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,487
we should have come to you.

59
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,091
Any idea what the V.M.
Stands for?

60
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,665
You borrowed
$1,000,000 from a man

61
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,933
without knowing
his first name.

62
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,768
- I know how it...
- It's not a question.

63
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,504
I'm just assessing
the level of stupidity.

64
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,605
- Hey, hey.
- Irv, come on,

65
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,940
we don't have to...

66
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,642
You get a lot of
business from us.

67
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,377
Which, boychik,
will stop the moment

68
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,145
they arrest you
for money laundering.

69
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,613
At which time,
all your business

70
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,649
goes to a criminal attorney.

71
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,551
And might I recommend
Bruce lipshits

72
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,852
in our Minneapolis office?

73
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,788
- We're not asking for...
- Irv, stop screwing around.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,493
I need you to do some digging
on this guy, his outfit.

75
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,061
Now, we gave you his card

76
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,330
and the card
his reps gave to us last year.

77
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,032
You have the loan document,

78
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,067
on which is a phone number
and a mailing address.

79
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,470
There's also
a corporate ID number!

80
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,238
So unless you got
the brains of a monkey,

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,573
you should be able to friend

82
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,942
this cocksucker on Facebook,
and reel him in.

83
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,278
And then?

84
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,183
Then we get him to
take his money back

85
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,818
and forget he ever met us.

86
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,768
How's Stella?

87
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,569
Yeah, she's good.

88
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,907
You think I was
too hard on him?

89
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,543
Irv?

90
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,677
Ray.

91
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,446
At the anniversary party.

92
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,518
Look, he...
It's been a long time coming,

93
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,086
you saying no to him.

94
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,755
- Haven't I always...
- Nuh-nuh-nuh.

95
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,426
Like a Swiss watch.
Reliable. That's you.

96
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,761
- So he should have no...
- Yeah, but...

97
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,296
Lookit, don't go...

98
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,733
We've been
friends a long time.

99
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,435
Don't go getting soft here.

100
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:20,005
We talked about this.
It's for his own good.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,640
A man like that,

102
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,275
used to blaming
others for his...

103
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,110
Maybe I should just
give him the stamp.

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,945
To what end?

105
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,248
You think that'll fix it?

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,118
Next thing he's going
to want is interest.

107
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,854
It's envy, the green monster.

108
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,590
- Your brother's a loser.
- He's not a loser.

109
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,793
Well, he's doing
a pretty good imitation.

110
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,665
And you're the goddamn
parking lot king of Minnesota.

111
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,167
He doesn't want
the stamp, pal.

112
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,735
He wants your life.

113
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,053
Deb?

114
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,925
What's it doing?

115
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,760
You hit "enter"?

116
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,962
What's "enter"?

117
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,330
It's a...

118
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,579
Now what do I...

119
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,722
Wait!

120
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,298
What happened?

121
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,166
Did I...

122
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,334
What did I...

123
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,402
I don't know.

124
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,371
- It just went.
- Uh-huh.

125
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,139
I'll check mine.

126
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,981
Mine's out, too.

127
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,416
Is it the power?

128
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,987
I mean, the lights are on.

129
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,592
I'll call the it kid
that Shirley knows.

130
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,766
<i>Zdraveyte,</i>
as the Bulgarians say.

131
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,867
Pardon?

132
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,070
<i>Ni hao</i> is the Chinese.

133
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,640
The corsicans use
the simple <i>salut.</i>

134
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,376
And <i>guten tag,</i>
if German's your thing.

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,181
Is that... are they with you?

136
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,717
Surmise.

137
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,050
What?

138
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,722
Because we arrived together,
we are together. Surmise.

139
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,358
- Well, are ya?
- Yes.

140
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,894
Can't park that here.

141
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,297
We got...
City's got an ordinance.

142
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,432
No, it's perfectly fine.

143
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,569
Mr. Stussy himself
gave me permission.

144
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,004
Who?

145
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,905
Your employer.

146
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,277
You do see the sign
above which you stand,

147
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,647
and how a man
with a keener sense of reason

148
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,815
might extrapolate a connection

149
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,717
with the name
I just mentioned.

150
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,319
Your boss.

151
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,422
- Look, mister...
- We're done here.

152
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,866
Okay then. Just... it's fine.

153
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,869
Like he said,
he's got permission.

154
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,208
No, I won't say
"from Mr. Stussy."

155
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,543
I'm not gonna create

156
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,712
the implication
of foreknowledge.

157
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,550
Of... knowing before the fact.

158
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,353
They have permission.
They can park there.

159
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,621
Thanks.

160
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,471
Did you see this
bullshit in the paper?

161
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,073
Some old-timer
out in the country,

162
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,109
they push in his
front door, tie him up.

163
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,445
He runs a general store,
and some hopped-up junkie

164
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,447
thinks he takes
the register money home.

165
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,918
Ennis Stussy.

166
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,755
Eighty-two years old.

167
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,092
Not the Minnesota
I grew up in,

168
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,193
I'll tell you that.

169
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,496
It's a tragedy.

170
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,600
Do you need something?

171
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,504
Oh, uh... there's...

172
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,978
Maybe a problem, not sure yet.

173
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,280
Just, this Varga fella...

174
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,149
I got a call
from the oakbridge lot.

175
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,583
The raised one?

176
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,418
No. Ground lot,
under the highway.

177
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,554
- Doesn't get a lot of traffic.
- Right.

178
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,091
Why'd we buy that one again?

179
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,459
Sprawl-wise,
you thought it'd be

180
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,994
a good investment long-term.

181
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,729
Maybe turn it
into condos one day.

182
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,997
Right.

183
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,799
We should talk
to Stan Grossman about that.

184
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,000
Test the waters.

185
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,636
Yeah. I'll make a note.

186
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,174
Anyway, it seems there's
a big rig parked there now.

187
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,975
- In the lot?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,277
Well, that's against code.

189
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,112
Well, okay. There's that, too.

190
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,582
But more to the point,
what's in it?

191
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,419
And I'm a little troubled
by the escalation.

192
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,855
Money loaned is
one thing, but this?

193
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,590
A truck full of...

194
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,358
Well...

195
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,496
It could be anything.
Booze, guns...

196
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,698
The kind of demeanor
this fella has...

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,501
You think maybe it's...

198
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,069
I don't even
wanna say it out loud.

199
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,871
Slave girls?

200
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,106
What? No.

201
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,543
I was gonna say drugs.
You think it's slave girls?

202
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,347
No.

203
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,016
I mean, he's capable,

204
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,484
this Varga fella,
don't you think?

205
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,719
Just from the one meeting.

206
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,525
We should probably
drive over there, take a look.

207
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,898
Or, and this is
the other way to go, not.

208
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,236
See, I'm thinking
about deniability.

209
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,204
What they call "plausible."

210
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,873
'Cause if we...

211
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,077
Look,
if Irv's right, and we...

212
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,079
Then we know.

213
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,081
Which, in a court of law...

214
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,515
Got it.

215
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:48,152
That's... you're...
Good thinking.

216
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,825
So, what do we...

217
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:57,028
I think we gotta wait
and see what Irv turns up.

218
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,897
Then, whatever dirt, we use

219
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,266
to extricate
ourselves overall.

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,774
<i>This is
the problem right here.</i>

221
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,444
It's not even
a proper police station.

222
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,748
Where do you keep prisoners?

223
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,617
There's a store room,
computer boxes, paper towels,

224
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,086
or we drive 'em
10 miles to paynesville.

225
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,091
Wait, you said computer boxes.
Where are the computers?

226
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,761
They're in the boxes.
Chief doesn't like computers.

227
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,863
Well, old chief. Sorry, chief.

228
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,799
Oh, you don't like them?

229
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,267
It's not that
I don't like them.

230
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,102
I don't like them,
but that's not...

231
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,771
The old way works just fine.

232
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,006
Type out a report,
send it via telex.

233
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,175
You do know
what year it is, right?

234
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,777
The future.

235
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,712
We don't use...
Who uses telexes anymore?

236
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,848
So that's why no one
ever writes me back.

237
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,453
The point is, if I need
a record search or priors run,

238
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,721
I just call Jerry at county.

239
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,789
Yeah, or Lou-Ann,

240
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,525
if Jerry's sick
or out or something.

241
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,062
I'm sorry to be
doing this today,

242
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,463
with the loss of
your father and all...

243
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,231
Stepfather.

244
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,334
But you need to
get with the program.

245
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,468
It's not the '50s anymore

246
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,903
where people
don't lock their front doors.

247
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,972
People don't lock
their front doors. Not here.

248
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,808
Although they might now,
after what happened to Ennis.

249
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,142
I'm just saying.

250
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,316
Chief...

251
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,118
As much as I want to hear

252
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,319
about this future
you've come from,

253
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,988
I got a potential
witness to interview

254
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,657
who may have seen our perp
gas up on his way out of town.

255
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,392
- So I'm gonna...
- You know what?

256
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,328
I'm gonna go ahead and pretend

257
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,663
you didn't just
mouth off to me

258
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,098
like my teenage daughter.

259
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,001
And I'm gonna go ahead

260
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,268
and let you
brace your witness.

261
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,671
And then I'm gonna let you
take a few days off to grieve.

262
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,507
But this is a done deal.

263
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,708
You're being
absorbed by the county.

264
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,210
You work for me now.

265
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,012
So, when you get back,

266
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,248
you and the chief, me,

267
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,317
are gonna have a long talk

268
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,085
about the way
things work around here.

269
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,947
<i>I told Donny.
It was the Russians.</i>

270
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,418
No. I think
he would've mentioned that.

271
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,821
This is Thursday night, yeah?
'Round 10:00 P.M.?

272
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,790
Why don't you start
from the beginning?

273
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,560
You know, it's whaddaya,
Thursday. I got the game on.

274
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,062
- Vikings?
- Gophers.

275
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,064
And it's one of those nights.

276
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,231
Miller, Miller lite,

277
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,434
cigarettes, cigarettes,
motor oil.

278
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,569
And then some
twitchy kid comes in,

279
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,404
wants a case of
frozen orange juice

280
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,173
concentrate, which...

281
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,108
Is that...
Can you make meth from that?

282
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,876
Not last I heard.

283
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,412
Maybe just
a vitamin deficiency.

284
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,247
My point is,

285
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,416
I'm already primed for...

286
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,085
And then
this fella comes in...

287
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,954
- "Fella" singular?
- If singular means just one.

288
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,923
And he's looking for,
wants to know,

289
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,591
do I have a phone book?

290
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,359
And you're saying
this fella was Russian?

291
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,028
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,663
From, like, an accent, or...

293
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,100
Well, now,
I can't rightly say.

294
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,534
Maybe he told me.

295
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,537
Well, like I said,
I got the gophers on.

296
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,940
But it's strong,
how I remember him.

297
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,575
So, I showed him
where the book was,

298
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,776
keep it on a chain.

299
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,711
Why do you keep
your phone book on a chain?

300
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,113
Well, remember in the '70s?

301
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,948
People used to steal 'em.

302
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,352
Anyhoo,
he looks through it, and then

303
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,123
just tears a page out.

304
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,126
Which, it's a public book,
which... meant for everyone.

305
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,827
So, I raise a ruckus.

306
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,229
Can I see it?

307
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,087
- Hey!
- Gotta take this as evidence.

308
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,055
Evidence of what?

309
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,993
Well, fella stopped in here,

310
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,194
used your phone book,
tore out the page

311
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,996
with Ennis' information on it.

312
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,998
Shortly thereafter,
Ennis is asphyxiated.

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,300
So, I'd say,
evidence he was looking for

314
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,502
Ennis' house but
didn't know the address.

315
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,183
"And in time of great joy,

316
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,085
"they had meat
and fowl and grain.

317
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,255
"And in time of sorrow,
they ate tears."

318
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,614
- Hey.
- See the game?

319
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,483
Not really.
Can I use your computer?

320
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,619
- What happened to yours?
- Vermin.

321
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,226
You still got that
con with the rack?

322
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,293
The what's that, now?

323
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,396
The brunette with
the nutcracker caboose?

324
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,534
I'm saying
her back end's so fit,

325
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,236
she could probably crack a walnut.

326
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,138
- Swango.
- Right.

327
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,308
Her Swango.

328
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,145
No, that's her name.
Nikki Swango.

329
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,418
Well, whatever she calls it,

330
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,687
I'd like to butter that bread.

331
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,231
Look, I got a...
One of my cons

332
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,300
blew his piss test,
Maurice Lefay.

333
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,835
What is he, Cajun?

334
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,670
No, he's from Wabasso,
I think.

335
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,473
Anyway,
he's MIA for his 9:00 A.M.,

336
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,608
and my thinking is
he likely flew the Coop.

337
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,844
Saw the writing on the wall,
if you know what I mean.

338
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,847
So, issue a bolo.

339
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,616
Jesus. You need me
to wipe your ass, too?

340
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,620
No. I'll do that.

341
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,878
Burt Lurdsman.

342
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,615
- What?
- Is the name.

343
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,517
His name.
The sponsor I told you about.

344
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,218
Potential.
I'm trying to visualize.

345
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,088
I...
They've got it listed as...

346
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,257
The initial report,
as accidental.

347
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,358
Maurice.

348
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,959
His cause of death,

349
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,594
misadventure
by major appliance.

350
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,430
Which is...
That's good, right?

351
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,964
He's in vacuum cleaners.

352
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,633
Invented some
kind of, whaddaya,

353
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,034
filter out of Bismarck.

354
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,602
And he's looking
for a new team.

355
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,573
Babe, we gotta...
I need you to focus.

356
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,308
We're not...

357
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,178
We dropped a 200-pound
ac on an ex-con,

358
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,846
and, yeah, it looks like
the cover-up's working,

359
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,980
but there's a long way to go

360
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,415
before we're out
of the woods here.

361
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,789
Ow!

362
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,959
What the heck?

363
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,227
There's something
wrong with your chi.

364
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,995
The what's that?

365
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,597
Like, your energy flow.

366
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,401
You're all blocked up, babe.
We can't have that.

367
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,274
Well, I've...

368
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,579
I never killed anybody before.

369
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,115
Well, me either.

370
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,983
Life's a journey, you know?

371
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,587
I gotta be honest.
I got some remorse.

372
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,056
'Course you do.

373
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,258
You're not a heartless killer.

374
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,628
You got the soul of a poet.

375
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,097
I do?

376
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,599
You bet.

377
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,835
You're my honey bear.

378
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,038
What if they catch us?

379
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,073
You know what happens

380
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,208
to ex-law enforcement
in the clink?

381
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,510
They're not gonna catch us.

382
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,279
Like you said,
it was an accident.

383
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,581
Plus,
we'll be out of here today.

384
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,450
I gave a fake ID to the cops.

385
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,386
The apartment's rented
under an assumed name.

386
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,022
Anybody thinks to follow up,
and it's just a dead end.

387
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,458
What about the fella
that Maurice killed?

388
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,427
The other Stussy?

389
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,594
Wasn't he really old?

390
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,729
So?

391
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,063
Hon, they don't
look at those cases

392
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,298
as close as the young ones.

393
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
- I don't think that's...
- It's just common sense.

394
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,369
What with them being so close
to the grave and all.

395
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,206
Besides, you said yourself,
he messed up, your man,

396
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,141
killed some random
geriatric in the sticks

397
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,277
who happened to
have the surname.

398
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,045
So, even if they
wanted to solve it,

399
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,447
the police,

400
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,416
what possible solve is there,
besides

401
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,285
unfathomable pinheadery?

402
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,722
You've thought of everything.

403
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,230
That's us. Thought and action.

404
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,468
The next Burt Lurdsman
grand national champions.

405
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,475
Don't get any ideas, mister.
I'm on my period.

406
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,577
Just remember,

407
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,912
when the bolo for Maurice
turns up a dead body,

408
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,781
you write "case closed,"
and file

409
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,583
the papers at
the dead-letter office.

410
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,688
Scotty's right. You got a real
nutcracker back there.

411
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,790
- Who?
- My boss.

412
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,091
We were talking, and...

413
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,960
You were talking about my ass
with your boss?

414
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,061
No.

415
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,763
He just...
I was using his computer

416
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,365
on account of vermin
ate through my cord,

417
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,167
and he just...

418
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,803
He asked if I still had you
as a con, and I said...

419
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,605
I hate that word,
"con."

420
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:08,939
It's so negative.

421
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,808
We weren't talking
about your ass, hon.

422
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,810
I don't know
what I was thinking.

423
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,211
We're never gonna
land Burt Lurdsman

424
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,280
with your chi all
blocked up like this.

425
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,450
Well, okay,
how do I unblock it?

426
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,753
We gotta find some sort of
psychic drano, or...

427
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,224
You know what it is,
don't you?

428
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,459
The blockage?

429
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,961
It's your stupid brother.

430
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,198
The history between you two
and how it made you go crazy,

431
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,834
and hire a doofus to
break into his house.

432
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,903
Hey, hon, I didn't hire him,
I was blackmailing him.

433
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,639
My point is,

434
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,208
this is a blood feud.

435
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,911
We can't be
fightin' a blood feud while

436
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,779
we're trying to land
a big-time sponsor.

437
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,484
We're just gonna
have to do it ourselves.

438
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,452
- Do?
- The stamp.

439
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,488
Get the stamp back.

440
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,423
Now, hon...

441
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,792
Well, it's either that,
or make peace with him.

442
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,595
Are you willing to do that?

443
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,231
Forgive and forget?

444
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,266
Bygones?

445
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,906
Who died?

446
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,642
When?

447
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,846
It's 10:30!

448
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,448
Shit. Did I wake you...

449
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,816
No. It's fine.

450
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,755
Stella's sleeping, though,
so let's talk over there.

451
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,484
I should've called.

452
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,685
Nah, it's...

453
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,022
Ray?

454
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,324
Oh.

455
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,728
Sometimes when you do
a piss test, they...

456
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,732
Why not just put on
both the other pair?

457
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,834
Well, it happens a lot.

458
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,371
Basically, this is now my only
non-micturated footwear.

459
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,260
<i>It's late, Ray.</i>

460
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,729
It's 10:30.

461
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,731
Fine.

462
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,005
I felt bad about
how we left things, you know,

463
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,742
the thing between us,
and always fighting.

464
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,781
Me, too. I felt bad, too.

465
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:08,018
And now, you know,
my chi's all backed up,

466
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,520
Nikki says.

467
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,355
And I know it's late,
but I thought

468
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,358
I'd come out here and say

469
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,094
I want to make up.

470
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,029
Bury the hatchet, you know,

471
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,532
put the past behind us,
bygones.

472
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,917
Well, I can't believe
you're saying this, kid,

473
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,051
after all...

474
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,388
Let me finish.
It's not, you know, easy.

475
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,028
You've done good here,
real good.

476
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,098
With Stella,
and the business...

477
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,069
And I just wanna say,
I'm proud of you,

478
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,972
and you don't owe me anything.

479
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,133
Well, I gotta say,
it's a huge relief.

480
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:33,270
With the week I'm having,
and after all these years.

481
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,340
Me, too.

482
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,850
Get home safe.

483
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,101
Ugh.

484
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,289
Irving.

485
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,659
Do I know you?

486
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,828
It's Yuri,
back from the old country.

487
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,897
<i>Da...</i>

488
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,065
Am I not right?

489
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,566
You grew up in Ukraine.

490
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,035
No.

491
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,270
My bubbe, her people...

492
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,607
You know,
you hear the old stories,

493
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,144
how she fled from the cossacks
in the middle of the night.

494
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,712
Five years old.

495
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,781
The men on horseback.

496
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,483
That is me.

497
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,520
- I'm sorry?
- Cossack.

498
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,156
When I saw your name...

499
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,125
You searched
for Mr. Varga, yes?

500
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,996
I thought,
I know these Blumkins.

501
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,100
We rode them down like animals
back in old days,

502
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,669
raped their women,
ate their babies.

503
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,310
Did you get it?

504
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,945
Now, before
you have a feeling,

505
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,513
let's just both agree,

506
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,781
this is gonna be a process.

507
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,483
What are you...

508
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,318
He's a worthy
opponent, I'll give him that.

509
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,520
Not only does he
hide the trump card,

510
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,689
he rubs our faces
in it with a burro.

511
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,524
I bet he was all
sweetness and cream

512
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,892
when you talked to him.

513
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,129
Well, actually, you know what?

514
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,165
It felt kind of good.

515
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:59,302
We really... we talked,
and I think we got past it.

516
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,439
Oh.

517
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,409
What do you...

518
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,310
No. Just...

519
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,813
No, you didn't...
I mean, no trace, right?

520
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,982
In and out. That's what we...

521
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:14,651
- Well...
- No. Come on.

522
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,322
Look at me.
It's clear now, I'm clear.

523
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,891
My chi, I can feel it.

524
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,692
And I did what you said.

525
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,128
We put it behind us.
Bygones. So...

526
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,466
Okay, to be fair,

527
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,003
that wasn't the plan.

528
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,072
You were supposed to...

529
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,941
While I broke in,
you would pretend to...

530
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,144
And you didn't see it, Ray.

531
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,448
He moved the stamp,
your brother.

532
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,416
He didn't trust you.

533
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,286
So he hung up, in its place...

534
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,756
If you saw what he hung up...

535
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,159
A donkey is what.

536
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,099
So, you see the symbolism.

537
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,301
Oh, he's good.

538
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,269
It's like I said,

539
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,638
he's got the physical
and the mental game.

540
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,475
Well, he may
have won this round,

541
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,709
but two can play at that...

542
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,980
We should... you should drive.

543
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,782
- Why?
- Just go.

544
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,293
- I don't...
- It's a message.

545
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,162
He sucker-punched me, Ray.
You were right.

546
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,964
Kept me talking
in the driveway

547
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,465
while the shifty fiancee
breaks in

548
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,733
looking for the stamp.

549
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,402
Where's the stamp?

550
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,238
The cleaning lady
broke the frame,

551
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,473
so I'm getting it fixed.
But he doesn't know that.

552
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,909
So they concoct
this genius strategy.

553
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,345
I should've seen it.

554
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,447
All these years, and suddenly
he gets a conscience?

555
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,681
I don't think so.

556
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,351
Why a tampon, though?

557
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,222
- Not that it...
- I'll tell you what, boy.

558
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,758
The gloves are off now.

559
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,728
He is d-o-n-e, done.

560
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,698
Like I said, it's about time.

561
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,068
And so,
here's what's gonna happen.

562
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,871
I'm gonna step in
and make this problem go away.

563
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,440
- Don't... I mean...
- I won't.

564
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,643
Just give him
the lay of the land.

565
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,211
He's dead to you.

566
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,013
To us.

567
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,549
We see your
brother again, he calls,

568
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,318
we go straight to the cops.
Rat him out to the city.

569
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,221
Dating a parolee.
Her parole officer.

570
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,190
There's gotta be
a law against that.

571
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,159
So, believe you me,
he'll scare.

572
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,028
That will be the end of that.

573
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,567
Hello?

574
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,070
Yeah?

575
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,747
Okay, Deb.

576
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,116
Thanks for calling.

577
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,255
What's...

578
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,823
Irv.

579
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,726
He jumped off the garage.

580
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,674
It's a tragedy.

581
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,676
It is.

582
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,812
He was 82.

583
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,715
So, a good life.

584
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,850
- Did you know him?
- I did.

585
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,519
A horrible man.

586
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,689
Have you notified
his next of kin?

587
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,659
We are his next of kin.

588
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,895
Of course. I meant

589
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,765
any other family
that he might have had,

590
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,934
outside of Minnesota.

591
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,503
I know he wasn't
from around here.

592
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,906
It's kind of,
to be honest, a mystery.

593
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,575
I mean,
as far as I can figure,

594
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,810
Ennis moved to
Eden Valley in 1980.

595
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,980
Married my mom in '82.
I was six.

596
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,249
And they were only together
for four years.

597
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,785
So, I mean, honestly,
we're not even family, really,

598
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,053
but I thought
Nathan should have

599
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,454
the influence of
a male elder in his life,

600
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,723
seeing as how his dad left.

601
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,296
You should ask
your mother, perhaps.

602
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,499
I would, except she's dead.

603
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,770
Of course. I'm sorry.

604
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,340
She's in the 21-j in ash.

605
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,146
So, if you know of any friends
Ennis may have had, or...

606
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,248
He didn't talk much.

607
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,649
Except to curse.

608
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,987
I think he may have
changed his name

609
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,121
before he moved here.

610
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,823
Did you ever hear
of Thaddeus Mobley

611
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,158
out of Los Angeles?

612
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,226
No, I'm afraid not.

613
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,536
Shall we choose a vessel?

614
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,357
No, I'm not...

615
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,458
<i>Here's a tune.</i>

616
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,959
<i>It's called</i> a Christmas song.

617
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,227
<i>Looks like it's
destined to become</i>

618
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,364
<i>one of the yuletide season's
genuine standards.</i>

619
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,971
There's a problem.

620
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,441
Is it you?

621
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,413
No, Ray.

622
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,981
It's you.

623
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,550
You and your
disgusting girlfriend.

624
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,185
Hey, now.

625
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:22,986
Sorry. Fiancee.

626
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:32,128
Look, there was, you know,
some mixed signals last night,

627
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,296
but I'm gonna call Emmit...

628
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,632
No. You're not.

629
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,402
In fact, you and Emmit
will never speak again.

630
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:41,805
Don't be, you know, dramatic.

631
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,607
Oh, I'm serious.

632
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,112
This is non-negotiable
after the stunt you pulled.

633
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,449
Feminine hygiene
deployed as a weapon.

634
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,550
I don't know what you're...

635
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,823
Are you listening to me?

636
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,926
You wanna watch your tone
when you talk to me,

637
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,194
errand boy.

638
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,563
- My tone?
- Your tone.

639
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,133
- My tone.
- Yeah, your...

640
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,570
This is between
me and my brother.

641
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,638
Never gonna happen.

642
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,007
Oh, yeah,
it's gonna happen all right.

643
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,491
You see that?

644
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,827
That's the last dime
you're ever gonna see

645
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,263
from the parking lot king
of Minnesota.

646
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,533
Yeah? Well, I got
something to show you, too.

647
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,066
Oh! What the shit?

648
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,578
Oh!

649
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,952
Oh, jeez!

650
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,723
My car!

651
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,825
Look what that animal
did to my car!

652
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,510
Madeline,
call my wife, will ya?

653
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,149
Madeline?

654
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,852
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,155
I didn't realize
Mr. Stussy was expecting you.

656
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,750
- Mr. Stussy...
- It's okay, Madeline,

657
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:41,317
I got it.

658
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,789
What can we do
for you, friend?

659
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,793
Mr. Stussy,
what a day. What a day.

660
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,030
I was hoping to show the boys
their new office.

661
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,132
Their...

662
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,401
It's this way,
if I'm not mistaken.

663
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,072
Call Sy.

664
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,476
Uh, we don't...

665
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,180
- We're pretty full right now.
- No, no, no.

666
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,415
It says on the blueprints

667
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,950
there's an entire wing
you've just rented.

668
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,118
Expanding, are we?

669
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,754
Well, that...
We acquired some new lots.

670
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,822
Yeah, and who have you got
to thank for that, eh?

671
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,328
There we go. Perfect!

672
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,583
This is not...
You can't just...

673
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,252
Stop! Look...

674
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,220
Come on!

675
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,456
Stop!

676
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,158
We have rights.

677
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,492
Emmit. Emmit.

678
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,629
You're making a scene,
all right?

679
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,631
Now,
let's talk in your office.

680
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,610
- What's...
- They just...

681
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Feltz,
they just pushed their way in.

682
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,284
Oh, good. They're here.

683
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,455
Uh, nothing to worry about,
Madeline.

684
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,224
Remember how I said
we were expanding

685
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,559
our IT department?

686
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,094
No.

687
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,629
Well, we are. So...

688
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,367
Sorry, I was
dealin' with the...

689
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,469
What?

690
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,838
Your...

691
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,941
Did I tell you
what I like about this place,

692
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,342
Minnesota?

693
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:53,015
It's so perfectly,
sublimely bland, innit?

694
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,489
Have you been to the Danube?
or Gansu?

695
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,391
And the African continent...
Forget it.

696
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,494
North and South. Anarchy.

697
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:08,364
And, yes, you can still find
some relative stability

698
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:12,802
in the brutal nation states,
North Korea...

699
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,271
Putin's done some great things
with Russia.

700
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,406
You just have to know
which palms to grease.

701
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,776
But one wearies
of the constant

702
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,945
remunerations and
the petty shakedowns...

703
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,482
Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss.

704
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,217
Am I right?

705
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,986
Mr. Varga?

706
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,354
Please, Sy...

707
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,524
Call me V.M.

708
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,958
Eh?

709
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,727
We're partners now.

710
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,295
We are not partners.

711
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,797
That... this...

712
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,365
- You lent us some...
- Capital.

713
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,733
Which we've told you,

714
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,635
we're happy to pay back
with interest.

715
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,510
You see, that's the problem
with you Americans.

716
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,179
You watch too many movies,
and you think

717
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,648
the deal can always
be changed, and it can't.

718
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,150
We're partners now,
and that's all there is to it.

719
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,785
So, you might as
well just lie back,

720
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:05,822
as they say,
and enjoy yourselves.

721
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,498
Let me tell you what it is
that attracts me

722
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,867
to the parking lot business,
yours in particular.

723
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,268
It's three things.

724
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,604
It runs on cash.

725
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,674
You don't use technology.

726
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,344
And that makes your income
impossible to verify.

727
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,680
'Cause who's to
say how many cars

728
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:33,816
parked in which spots
and for how long?

729
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:37,887
Mr. Varga, V.M., if I may...

730
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,356
We show, in our books...

731
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,726
We show a very consistent,
very steady,

732
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,528
predictable income

733
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,196
from lot to lot,

734
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,066
consistent with
several urban volume factors.

735
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,870
And if you start
goosing those numbers...

736
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:58,774
Well,
So we buy more lots.

737
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,511
Maybe branch out,
start developing

738
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:06,315
some multi-function commercial
and residential properties,

739
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,251
a new stadium, perhaps.

740
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,456
There.

741
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,559
There you go.
Now you're seeing it.

742
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,961
The inescapable reality.

743
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,765
You're trapped.

744
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,436
Don't look so sad.

745
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,307
By the time we're done,
you'll be billionaires.

746
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,677
On paper, at least.

747
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,748
Good. Well,
that's that out of the way.

748
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,516
Now, you may not see
much of me

749
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,918
for a couple of days,

750
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,920
brutal nation states and all,

751
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,588
but Yuri and Meemo
will be here

752
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,790
to make sure
everything runs smoothly.

753
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:52,295
And, oh, yes,
condolences on your attorney.

754
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,733
What makes it so tragic
is how avoidable it was.

755
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,201
But you understand,

756
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,339
I can't have people out there
investigating things.
