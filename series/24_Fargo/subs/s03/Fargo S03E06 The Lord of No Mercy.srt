1
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,757
Two guys...

2
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,798
A Russian and some...

3
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,470
Some kind of oriental.

4
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,808
Drove a late model Cadillac.

5
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,582
I didn't get the license.

6
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:41,122
Ahh.

7
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,009
You ready?

8
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,011
Oh, you betcha.

9
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,748
Come on.

10
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,667
This is a true story.

11
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,849
A 150-year-old bank

12
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:58,661
with $60 billion in
assets collapses overnight.

13
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:04,033
Its stock price drops
93% in eight hours.

14
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:08,571
One day, it's solvent,
the next, it's worthless.

15
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:12,608
Perception of reality becomes reality.

16
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:16,545
Another true story.

17
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:24,185
The First World War was
started by a sandwich.

18
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,655
On June 28th, 1914,

19
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,392
Gavrilo Princip, one
of seven conspirators,

20
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,777
failed to blow up the
Archduke of Austria

21
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:36,427
with a hand grenade.

22
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:40,132
Demoralized, Gavrilo stopped for lunch

23
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,667
at Schiller's delicatessen

24
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:44,769
on Franz Joseph Street in Sarajevo.

25
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,938
But as he was eating,

26
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:51,676
the Archduke's driver, lost,

27
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:55,345
pulled up outside the
restaurant and stopped.

28
00:04:57,316 --> 00:05:01,851
Fate had delivered
Gavrilo's target to him

29
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,155
and he would not miss twice.

30
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:11,061
One last story, also true.

31
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:13,236
Here men from the Planet Earth

32
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,231
first set foot upon the moon.

33
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:19,210
July 1969 A.D.

34
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,237
I guess you're about
the only person around

35
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,773
that doesn't have TV
coverage of the scene.

36
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,477
That's one small step for man,

37
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,682
one giant leap for mankind.

38
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,616
Cut!

39
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,835
Wait.

40
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,303
What?

41
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,006
It was a sound stage in New Mexico.

42
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:03,543
That's not...

43
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,912
That never happened.

44
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,514
"Let each man say what he deems truth

45
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,051
and let truth itself
be commended unto God."

46
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,387
Emmit, are you gonna...

47
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:19,859
The point is, Stussy Lots Ltd.
Are in the process of securing

48
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:23,164
$50 million in new loans.

49
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:27,298
Now, we're gonna use that
money to buy 16 more lots,

50
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,867
after paying some healthy bonuses

51
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,235
to the partners, of course.

52
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,403
You're talking about

53
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,243
doubling the size of the
company in six months?

54
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,442
- Three months.
- It's a lot of debt.

55
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,612
And just to line our
pockets? Shouldn't we...

56
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:45,949
I'm just sayin', a more
cautious approach. Why not?

57
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,051
Because the shallow end of the pool

58
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:50,287
is where the turds float.

59
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:53,523
Emmit?

60
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:56,693
No one ever got anywhere
staying home, Sy.

61
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,195
What does that mean?

62
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,167
It means, we're either doing this,

63
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,531
or we're not doing it.

64
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,801
Whether you step off the
board with one foot or two,

65
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:08,104
you still end up in the water.

66
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,073
Okay. But what about the IRS?

67
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:12,308
You said yourself, he's sitting

68
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,609
in the conference room right now,

69
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,743
going over the books.

70
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,745
Some books, not "the" books.

71
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:19,114
What the heck does that mean?

72
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,683
Let's just say for testimonial purposes,

73
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,451
it's better that you don't know.

74
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:27,005
Oh, you think the IRS
won't... This is what they do.

75
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,516
Catch cheats.

76
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,756
Middle managers and movie stars,

77
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,160
people who park their money
in a Denver Wells Fargo

78
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:36,660
under their mother-in-law's maiden name.

79
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:37,855
But I assure you,

80
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,865
the IRS could not
unravel an intricate web

81
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,968
of shell companies and
loan-outs with secret accounts

82
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:47,405
in Monaco, Luxembourg,
and the Cook Islands,

83
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,874
if you gave them the account numbers.

84
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,819
What?

85
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,146
I'm beginning to think that

86
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:57,147
finance is more of a hobby with you.

87
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,549
Just how are we supposed to...

88
00:07:58,584 --> 00:07:59,962
It's already done.

89
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:04,488
I've even seeded in the odd
100K as an act of good faith.

90
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,822
Emmit, you wanna...

91
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,658
Your problem, Mr. Feltz, is you think

92
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,926
you started a parking lot company.

93
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,020
You started a bank.
This is a true story.

94
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,420
When I'm done with you,

95
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:16,724
they'll be sponging you off the floor.

96
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,600
Yeah? You'll be in the poor house

97
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,403
making soup out of your dirty socks.

98
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:23,556
Bigger the bank, the safer the banker.

99
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,242
So, the IRS?

100
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,712
Leave the IRS to me.

101
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,155
Section 41C of the US tax code

102
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,790
affords my client the right
to licensed representation

103
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,993
in the face of any IRS inquiry.

104
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:00,730
As counsel, I'm filing here
with you an official protest

105
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,225
to this baseless and cockeyed inquiry,

106
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,961
and demand you withdraw immediately

107
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,139
and file by mail

108
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:09,464
the statutory-required 30-day notice

109
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,139
listing the exact documents you require

110
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,576
and personnel you wish to interview.

111
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:18,414
Until that time, we demand
you vacate our offices.

112
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:21,943
Immediately.

113
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:33,617
Third fella.

114
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,119
Could be the head honcho.

115
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:40,905
No.

116
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,740
Why not?

117
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,996
Baby, trust me.

118
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:48,632
I want payback, maybe
even more than you.

119
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,467
But we gotta wait.

120
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,511
Babe, shouldn't we...

121
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,081
I'm worried you've
got internal injuries.

122
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,481
I'm fine.

123
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,817
I'm just saying, drop
in to the emergency room,

124
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,719
let 'em take a look.

125
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,021
You said yourself, the
cops are looking for me.

126
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,025
And these fellas, the villains,

127
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,961
probably watching the hospital.

128
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,328
I don't like it.

129
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,465
He's into something, your brother.

130
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,267
I got the sense from his lawyer, Feltz,

131
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,069
that it may be involuntary.

132
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,256
Meaning, against his will.

133
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:00,809
So, you sayin'...

134
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,147
What are you sayin'?

135
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:08,548
Some shady dealings.

136
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:11,718
Guys like your brother, fat cats,

137
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:15,422
making secret moves,
looking for quick returns.

138
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:18,259
What do they care if
a wad is legit or not?

139
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,763
Didn't you say he was having
money trouble a while back?

140
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,630
In the crash, yeah.

141
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,266
Business like theirs, real estate,

142
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,801
with the mortgage collapse.

143
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,270
He never said so, Emmit,
but I think he was worried.

144
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,371
So, what does he do?

145
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:34,774
He goes to the bank, tries to borrow.

146
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,243
But we know from the
news, they're not lending.

147
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,279
A loan shark?

148
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:42,247
On that level they
call 'em something else.

149
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:43,615
Private equity.

150
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,252
But a shark in a suit is still a shark.

151
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,824
We got any more aspirin?

152
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:56,761
Those fellas are lucky you held me back.

153
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:58,362
No one puts a finger on my woman

154
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,932
- and gets away with it.
- Easy, baby.

155
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,466
You'll get your chance.

156
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,559
But first, we gotta know the play.

157
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,399
Yeah.

158
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,181
Right this way.

159
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,230
Mr. Stussy, these ladies
are here to see you.

160
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,032
Oh, yeah?

161
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,768
Gloria Burgle.

162
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,904
Hi. Winnie Lopez.

163
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,506
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yeah, thanks.

164
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,875
What's this about?

165
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,343
I'm, uh, chief of Eden Valley.

166
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,312
- Out near Paynesville.
- Right.

167
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:29,100
And, uh, Officer Lopez
is from here in St. Cloud.

168
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:30,444
I was in the other night

169
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,639
talking to your Mr. Feltz

170
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,568
about a traffic skirmish
involving a company car.

171
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:38,090
Well, I'm... Sure. I mean,

172
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,657
Sy's the man to help you there.

173
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,859
I don't know how I could, uh...

174
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,896
Moshi-moshi.

175
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,765
I'm sorry, I couldn't
help but overhearin', uh...

176
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:50,368
This sounds like my area of expertise,

177
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:52,270
if you like to talk in my office?

178
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,272
That's... I got it.

179
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,706
Don't trouble yourself.

180
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,946
There's no trouble. I
know how busy you are.

181
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:07,418
So, what are we talking about here?

182
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,253
I didn't get your name?

183
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,787
True.

184
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:13,389
This is Mister, uh...

185
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,291
I'm an associate of Mr. Stussy's

186
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:17,427
is all you need to know for now.

187
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,363
Associate in what capacity?

188
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:23,366
Ladies shoes.

189
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,638
We'll come back to that.

190
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,476
Mr. Stussy, have you seen
your brother recently?

191
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:37,179
- My...
- Raymond.

192
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,713
No, I know his name. I just...

193
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,149
I thought this was
about a traffic accident.

194
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,022
In a way.

195
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,318
Well, it either is,
or it isn't, isn't it?

196
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:46,754
Turns out the traffic
accident I was in for previous

197
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,056
- is connected to a homicide.
- We think.

198
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,022
A homicide?

199
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,492
Yes, sir, that's my case.

200
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,561
Uh, victim ran a grocery
store in Eden Valley

201
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,897
about 30 miles south
of here, Ennis Stussy.

202
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,234
I read that in The
Tribune, the old fella.

203
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,668
What'd he die with, again?

204
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,170
His mouth and nose were glued shut.

205
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,271
Christmas.

206
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:06,739
Also, the house was ransacked

207
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,408
in search of what, we're not yet sure.

208
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,810
But, as of yesterday,
we pinned the crime

209
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,179
on an ex-convict named Maurice LeFay.

210
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,781
This is from hard evidence,
fingerprints and the like.

211
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,218
Turns out your brother
was his parole officer.

212
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,285
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,887
And that got us wondering,
especially since Mr. Stussy, Raymond,

214
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:24,123
his car got rammed
into by another vehicle

215
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:25,824
registered to your company and...

216
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,559
Allegedly, words exchanged between Ray

217
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:30,062
and a yet-to-be-identified
member of your team.

218
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,630
- My team?
- Yes, sir.

219
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:32,998
And we thought it curious

220
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,866
the house being targeted
and searched as it was

221
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,102
that he shared the same last
name as you and your brother.

222
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,141
The same first initial.

223
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,271
Lived in towns with similar names.

224
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:43,117
What are they...

225
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:47,445
Is there some kind of
feud between you and Ray?

226
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,781
A feud? No.

227
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,484
'Cause we had your
brother into the station,

228
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,452
asked him the same
question, and he said...

229
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,786
Well, I mean...

230
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,022
Okay, we had our
differences over the years.

231
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,357
Who hasn't?

232
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:03,460
Brothers and all, but
nothing like a feud.

233
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,795
May I?

234
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,032
What exactly is the
connection, in your mind,

235
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:12,301
between Emmit's alleged
brother and the victim?

236
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,802
His alleged?

237
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:16,305
Are you suggesting
somehow Ray Stussy isn't...

238
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,407
It's your story, Detective.

239
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:20,642
I'm merely looking for clarification.

240
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,879
Chief, not detective.

241
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,050
My apologies.

242
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,917
My point is,

243
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:32,520
all this sounds like mere surmise.

244
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,556
Two brothers, a traffic skirmish,

245
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,391
a dead man in another county.

246
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,293
Mere what?

247
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,462
All named Stussy.

248
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:46,433
You see, in 1932 there were, what,

249
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,703
24 Hitlers in a German phone book.

250
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,205
Now, are you suggesting

251
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,142
that they were all responsible
for the Final Solution?

252
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,512
Twenty-four, exactly?

253
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:05,451
Sir, was there some kind of disagreement

254
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,253
over money between you and your brother?

255
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,955
Or if not money,
something he wanted back?

256
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,460
- Reason we ask is...
- Mmm-mmm.

257
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:21,670
You're saying...

258
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,036
My brother was trying to rob me?

259
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,005
All right. Look.

260
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,174
I'd like to thank you

261
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,143
for bringing all this to our attention.

262
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,511
And to assure you that

263
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,146
if anything fruitful comes to mind,

264
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:37,496
any details that you
might find illuminating,

265
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:38,574
then we'll make sure

266
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,717
to bring them to your
attention, all right?

267
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:42,686
Are we leaving?

268
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,622
Yes, you are. Come on.

269
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,865
If you think of anything.

270
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,705
Thanks. Thank you.

271
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,175
So, Eden Valley, is it a nice town?

272
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,478
We got a Tastee Freez and a Dairy Queen.

273
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:11,513
Will wonders never cease? Come on.

274
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,530
Seems like your brother's
got a backbone after all.

275
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,790
There is a police station

276
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,692
in Eden Valley with no computers.

277
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,061
I'd like to take a look at a case file.

278
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,596
One or two?

279
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,564
Just Yuri.

280
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,932
I think keep a low profile.

281
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,601
Now, the victim's name is...

282
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,972
Stussy. Same as our benefactor.

283
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,743
- Quiet or loud?
- Quiet.

284
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,279
I'm trying to contain
something, not expand it.

285
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,735
Stay the course for me?

286
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:02,750
Put an ear to this
Goldfarb meeting tonight?

287
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,152
They're on for 6:00.

288
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:06,187
Now...

289
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,123
I want you to find the brother,

290
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:10,291
this Ray character, and his bitch.

291
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,315
Execute?

292
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:46,479
Got anything back there?

293
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,741
Nope, it's all locked up back here.

294
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,485
Come back tomorrow.

295
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:58,127
Hon?

296
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,562
Heat's on. We better blow.

297
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,480
Okay, come on.

298
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:47,540
Ray, slow up.

299
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:51,309
Sorry, babe. We should
get off the street.

300
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:53,311
I know a motel where they take cash.

301
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:54,745
Good boy.

302
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,256
- All right?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,139
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,483
I think I'm gonna
need you to round me up

305
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:48,952
some more aspirin, babe.

306
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:51,021
Maybe a cold compress.

307
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:55,058
Thought I could tough it
out, but I guess I'm a wimp.

308
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:56,761
Baby, please.

309
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:58,929
That beating that you took...

310
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:01,231
I swear to God, if those
guys were here, I...

311
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,834
Cash only, remember.

312
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,670
For the aspirin. They can
track the cards, the cops.

313
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:09,339
I know. I just gotta...

314
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:12,909
I, uh, used my last
20 for the room. So...

315
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,911
What about the sack from the bank?

316
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:16,913
There's still a few
thousand in that, right?

317
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:20,361
Ray.

318
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,019
Tell me you brought the getaway money.

319
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:26,054
It's just that we...

320
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:28,490
It happened so fast.

321
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:31,193
Ray, we need that money.

322
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,394
I know.

323
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,190
I mean, if it were just
the underworld types,

324
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:35,897
but with the law enforcement
on our ass, we're...

325
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,599
- I know, I'm going.
- You want me to go?

326
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:39,868
No, I'm fine.

327
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:41,936
Ray.

328
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,371
I got it.

329
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,245
You win.

330
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,147
I'm done.

331
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,252
Whatever you want, just tell me.

332
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:55,398
I co-signed the mortgage,
you think I don't have a key?

333
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,262
Came for my money.

334
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:05,441
The Dalmatian at the bank.

335
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:08,504
You poured her in the trash, the dog.

336
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,540
I got it for Grace when she was seven.

337
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,948
Laverne. She didn't live that long.

338
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:18,096
Car got her, but we'd grown attached.

339
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,315
I was looking for my stamp.

340
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:28,322
You know, I was thinking
about her on the way over.

341
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:31,592
I can't think of a single
person doesn't like me.

342
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,494
Except you.

343
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,129
That's what they say to your face.

344
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:38,836
No. Ray, I'm a fair man.

345
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,701
I treat people honestly.

346
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:44,171
- Help 'em when they're down.
- Them you help.

347
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:46,461
When did I not help you, kid?

348
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,476
Everything you asked.

349
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,944
Co-signing the mortgage,
repairs for the car.

350
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,546
I'm not less than you.

351
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,607
Some child that needs...

352
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,350
Ray, come on.

353
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:01,453
We've done this already.

354
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:03,855
Been doing it for 20 years. Enough.

355
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,715
It's finished, okay?

356
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:36,953
Words said in anger, crimes committed...

357
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,589
We've both done things.

358
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:42,650
It's a certain madness, I think.

359
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:44,760
Brotherhood.

360
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:47,763
Buttons you push in
me, that I push in you.

361
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:49,365
Grudges...

362
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:52,201
But I don't want that anymore.

363
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:55,605
So...

364
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,375
I'm giving you the stamp.

365
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,018
Well, you're not giving it to me.

366
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,788
No. I am.

367
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:16,558
You can't give me what
was mine from the start.

368
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:22,929
Okay.

369
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,701
No, that's...

370
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,705
Take it.

371
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,674
It's yours.

372
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:34,774
I said take it.

373
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,176
I don't want it.

374
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:39,111
Take the damn stamp.

375
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:40,446
Stop!

376
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:42,181
Take it!

377
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:01,566
Don't. Don't.

378
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:04,603
Jesus.

379
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,811
Emmit.

380
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:16,714
Emmit.

381
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,450
Ray.

382
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:10,898
Raymond?

383
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:52,151
Mr. Stussy.

384
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:57,642
Do you know what Lenin

385
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:01,913
said about Beethoven's
Piano Sonata Number 23?

386
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,018
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.

387
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:08,786
Not the bloody walrus.

388
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:10,854
He said, "I know nothing

389
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,090
that is greater than the Appassionata,

390
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,395
but I cannot listen too often.

391
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,197
It affects one's nerves,

392
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,699
and makes one

393
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:26,803
want to say kind, stupid things,

394
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,805
and stroke the heads of those

395
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,042
who, living in such a foul hell,

396
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,220
can create such beauty.

397
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:42,884
Better to beat the person
unmercifully over the head."

398
00:35:47,591 --> 00:35:49,524
Where are you, Mr. Stussy?

399
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:55,396
There's been an accident.

400
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:07,441
Things of consequence
rarely happen by accident.

401
00:36:09,078 --> 00:36:10,978
Can you come?

402
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,814
Give me the address and
I'll leave immediately.

403
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,985
I'm at Ray's.

404
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,130
Did anyone see you?

405
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,169
I'm so rarely seen,
maybe I don't even exist.

406
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:05,952
What's he doing here?

407
00:39:06,787 --> 00:39:08,321
You called for help.

408
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,457
This is what help looks like.

409
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:17,330
I wanted to find his
pulse, but I was afraid.

410
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:21,568
Afraid you'd leave fingerprints?

411
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,737
Where else might we
find your fingerprints?

412
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,974
Uh, I came in that door.

413
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:31,309
So, the knob, inside and out.

414
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,845
That frame, the glass.

415
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:37,670
Bury the body, missing person?

416
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:44,174
No.

417
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:47,657
Collect the frame and the stamp,

418
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,126
and leave the glass.

419
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:56,597
Is there someplace you're
supposed to be right now?

420
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,607
Is there someplace you're
supposed to be right now?

421
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:06,509
Uh, what time is it?

422
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,980
A meeting, a dinner.

423
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:13,100
Which is it, a meeting or a dinner?

424
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:14,883
Uh, dinner.

425
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,351
With whom?

426
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:19,487
- Sy.
- Which restaurant?

427
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:21,656
Uh, it's in my phone.

428
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:23,658
Never mind, never mind.

429
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:25,360
Listen, this is important.

430
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:27,296
If the restaurant has a back door,

431
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,596
go to the bathroom

432
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,531
and wash your face and
hands in very cold water,

433
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:32,766
then go to the table.

434
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:34,936
That way, if any witnesses see you,

435
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:36,804
they won't be able to time your arrival.

436
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,272
Do you understand?

437
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:39,773
Yeah, but...

438
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,208
Emmit.

439
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:43,945
Look at me.

440
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,580
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

441
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,919
Your brother

442
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:57,123
was killed by his ex-convict girlfriend.

443
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,194
He'd been abusing her, you see?

444
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:03,696
Beating her in places you don't show.

445
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:07,099
And tonight she'd had
enough, so she cut his throat.

446
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:11,036
And watched him bleed.

447
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,105
Now,

448
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,040
the police will contact you tonight

449
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,808
to inform you of his death.

450
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:19,478
Be upset, not too upset.

451
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:22,046
Volunteer nothing, you
haven't seen him for days,

452
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:23,647
you haven't spoken to him.

453
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,850
I called him on his cell.

454
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:28,386
- When?
- Yesterday.

455
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:31,255
Right. Well, there'll
be a record of that.

456
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,592
Did you speak for long?

457
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:36,163
Just a few minutes.

458
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:39,696
All right. Well, it's just a quick call,

459
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,365
just to catch up, innit?

460
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,533
Be vague.

461
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,140
I didn't mean to...

462
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,478
No one ever does.

463
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,451
Walk him to his car, out in the back.

464
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,953
Make sure you're not seen.

465
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:26,074
Nothing like a feud.

466
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,442
Will wonders never cease?

467
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,143
Go figure. It's a pretty common name.

468
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,045
- There's jealousy there.
- Ladies shoes.

469
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:33,480
Screw it.

470
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,497
St. Cloud Metro, this
is Eden Valley One.

471
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,192
Go ahead, Eden Valley.

472
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:48,694
Yeah, I'm trying to get a
message to Officer Lopez.

473
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:51,164
Tell her I'm heading
back to the PO's domicile.

474
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,698
Have her meet me there.

475
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:53,966
Will do.
