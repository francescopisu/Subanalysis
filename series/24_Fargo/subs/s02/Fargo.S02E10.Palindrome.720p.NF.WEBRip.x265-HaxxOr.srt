Let's get some American food
up in this.

186
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,730
Everyone's dead.

187
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,300
Unh-unh.

188
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,440
Forget something?

189
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,720
Ricky:

190
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,990
Well... You caught me.

191
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,270
I thought nobody was home.

192
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,570
We're here.

193
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,130
Remind me which one
you are again.

194
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,160
The kid Otto had with the maid?

195
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,400
You see the shotgun, right?

196
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,970
You couldn't afford a real one?

197
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,590
Times are tough,
friend-o.

198
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,470
Hey, why do you think
I'm stealing the silver?

199
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,730
Hey, maybe...

200
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,260
In the spirit of, uh...

201
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,000
Human struggle...

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,270
We say bygones...

203
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,600
You let me get back in my car
and drive away.

204
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,730
Do you know what the definition
of the word "sovereignty" is?

205
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,090
What am I?

206
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,900
The professor
from "gilligan's island"?

207
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,500
Sovereignty is
absolute power and authority.

208
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,800
Like a king?

209
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,970
Exactly.

210
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,660
Which is who I am...

211
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,870
Your king.

212
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,560
Uh...

213
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,030
It's America, brother.

214
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,160
We don't do kings.

215
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,070
Oh, we do.

216
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,670
We do.

217
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,170
We just call them
something else.

218
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,570
See, today is my coronation day.

219
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,200
And on coronation day,
I've always believed

220
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,500
a new king should start
his reign

221
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,830
with an act of kindness.

222
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,490
Right on.

223
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,240
And an act of cruelty.

224
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,370
That way, your subjects know
that you're capable of both...

225
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,700
God and monster.

226
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,800
Shit.

227
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,240
Sign me up for the first one.

228
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,200
Problem is Wilma works
in the kitchen.

229
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,440
The injun?

230
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,590
Right.

231
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,970
She has already received
my kindness...

232
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,560
To wit, a brand-new car

233
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,930
and all the money
that was in that cabinet

234
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,760
you were searching.

235
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,090
Damn.

236
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,970
Which means you...

237
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,530
don't tell me.

238
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,930
Are shit out of luck.

239
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,240
Story of my life, brother.

240
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,560
Hey, you ever been to Baltimore?

241
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,740
Mike: An act of cruelty,
remember?

242
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,390
Well

243
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,640
I'm bushed.
Think I'm gonna go take a nap.

244
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,440
You should get some rest, too.

245
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,920
For, in the morning,
we journey home to bathe

246
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,290
in that warm champagne
that is corporate praise.

247
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,930
Who knows?

248
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,660
Maybe they'll
even throw us a parade.

249
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,730
I love a parade.

253

Peggy: Save
your strength, huh?

254
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,280
You're gonna be fine,
and we'll figure this all out.

255
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,060
And i-i know I've been nothing
but trouble to ya.

256
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,690
I know.

257
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,690
Maybe he just walks away.

258
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,490
He's tryin' to smoke us out.

259
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,380
Help me, Ed.

260
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,690
They'll see.

261
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,060
Somebody, they'll see,
and they'll...

262
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,260
They'll call someone.

263
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,090
They'll see.

264
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
Oh, my god.

265
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,460
Ed.

266
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,390
It's just like the movie...

267
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,630
The movie I was watchin'
this mornin'

268
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,250
with the guy all tied up...
The Gerhardt...

269
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,060
On the TV.

270
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,560
There was this...
There was this couple...

271
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,930
This French...
And they were on the run...

272
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,950
From the Nazi, I gu...
Uh, and...

273
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,980
And the husband
or whatever he was, he...

274
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,760
He got shot, just like you.

275
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,060
But then they hid out in this...

276
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,330
Well, it wasn't a supermarket.
It was a farmhouse.

277
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,650
But they hid out, and the...

278
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,060
And the Nazi tried
to smoke them out

279
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,990
just like this.

280
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,060
But they got out!

281
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,560
Ed, they got out!
They were saved!

282
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,190
Ed.

283
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,050
Ed.

284
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,290
Ed!

285
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,630
No! Ed?

286
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,680
Ed!

287
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,330
No.

288
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,060
Peggy! It's okay!
It's okay! It's me!

289
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,730
Where is he?!
It's me!

290
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,680
Where is he?!
I'll kill him!
Lou: It's okay!

291
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,930
No, no, no. He's gone.
He's gone, hon.
No, you're lying to me!

292
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,280
Husband's down.
No! No!
You stay back!

293
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,560
Where is he?!
Where's the Indian?!

294
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,360
Where is he?!
Stop.

295
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,260
He tried to smoke us out,
just like in the movie!
No!

296
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,890
Peggy,
there's no smoke!
No!

297
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,960
There's no smoke.
We need to check on Ed.

298
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,390
He's shot.
He's shot!

299
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,060
He was... he was...
He was shot,

300
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,690
and the Indian...
Where is he?

301
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,030
He tried to light a fire,
just like in the movie!

302
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,280
Just like in the movie!

303
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,590
Where is he?!

304
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,930
Peggy.
Where's the Indian?

305
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,580
Just look at me.
No.

306
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,260
He lit a fire.
No, the Indian
got away, okay?

307
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,530
We followed
Ed's blood trail, okay?

308
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,280
Kicked in
the door... us.

309
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,890
No, he's here.
The Indian was never
in the building.

310
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,730
No, he was.
Ed will tell ya.
No.

311
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Ed? Ed? Ed?

312
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,760
Come on, Ed.
We're saved.

313
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,560
Ed!
They're here!

314
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,730
We're rescued!

315
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,280
Ed! Ed!

316
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,730
Ed!

317
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,850
Come on, Ed!

318
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,690
There's a manhunt under way
for our man.

319
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,660
Won't get far.

320
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,680
Local p.D. Says
your father-in-law is

321
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,630
in the I.C.U.

322
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,680
"Cautiously optimistic"
is the report.

323
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,330
What about your boss?

324
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,830
Ah.

325
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,330
You know, I don't...
I don't even know...

326
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,150
How to write this thing up...

327
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,830
Where to begin.

328
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,190
Well, like anything,
i guess, you know?

329
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,390
Just start at the start
and work your way to the end.

330
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,650
Okay, then.

331
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,490
Yeah.

332
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,360
You're gonna be okay.

333
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm gonna take Peggy blumquist
back to Minnesota.

334
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,150
If anyone's got a problem
with that,

335
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,260
after the week I've had,
they can keep it to themselves.

S-so...

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,770
Is it...?

343
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,800
Do you feel it?

344
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,550
Feel what?

345
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,670
My aunt lost her bosom
to cancer.

346
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,310
Said it felt like
somebody took a hot poker

347
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,950
and put it through her heart.

348
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,550
No.

349
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,040
Not like that.

350
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,300
Not yet.

351
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,410
You know how sometimes
you get a peach from the bowl

352
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,410
and one side is ripe and yellow

353
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,110
and the other is black
and moldy?

354
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,170
That... that's the only way
i can think to describe it.

355
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,910
Camus says knowin' we're
gonna die makes life absurd.

356
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,250
Well, I don't know who that is.

357
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,500
But I'm guessing he doesn't
have a 6-year-old girl.

358
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,880
He's French.

359
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,750
Ugh, I don't care
if he's from Mars.

360
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,470
Nobody with any sense would say
something that foolish.

361
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,480
We're put on this earth
to do a job.

362
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,910
And each of us gets
the time we get to do it.

363
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,050
And when this life is over

364
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,300
and you stand
in front of the lord...

365
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,210
Well, you try tellin' him

366
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,450
it was
all some frenchman's joke.

367
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,110
Do ya think...

368
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,950
Is there any chance
i could be tried federal?

369
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,710
Why?

370
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,080
I thought... well, maybe I could
serve my time in California.

371
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,650
There was this news report
on the TV

372
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,140
about how there's
this penitentiary

373
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,300
just north of San Francisco
that looks out on the bay.

374
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,210
Doesn't that sound nice?

375
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,310
Maybe see a pelican.

376
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,650
We'll see what we can do.

377
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,310
I was there
at the end, you know?

378
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,280
After the war, when Saigon fell,

379
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,850
on the u.S.S.<i> Kirk</i> patrolling
the coast.

380
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
And when the country went,
it went fast.

381
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,170
And we had, like, you know,
24 hours to get everybody out.

382
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,480
And not just Americans,
but... Our allies,

383
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,980
the south vietnamese,

384
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,850
all packed onto boats
and helicopters.

385
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,500
We stood on the deck
and waved them in.

386
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,650
And one by one,
they'd land, unload,

387
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,440
and then we'd push
the whirlybirds into the sea.

388
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,500
The damndest thing.

389
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,450
But then, this chinook comes.

390
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,170
And those things...
You can't just land one

391
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,810
on a ship this size.

392
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,950
So we wave them off.

393
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,170
But the pilot's got
his whole family inside,

394
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,510
and he's running out of fuel,
so it's now or never.

395
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,480
So he hovers over the deck.

396
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,110
People start... Jumping...

397
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,710
Scared or not...
Onto the ship.

398
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,680
There's a baby...

399
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,510
Literally a-a tiny baby...

400
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,210
And the mother
just... just drops him.

401
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,380
And one of my boys...

402
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,010
Like catching a ball,

403
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,450
just sticks out his hands.

404
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,980
So, now everybody's out,
and I'm thinking,

405
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,580
"how the heck is
this pilot"... right?...

406
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,910
"how's he gonna get out?"

407
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,610
But he maneuvers
off the port bow,

408
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,010
and he hovers there
for the longest time doing,

409
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,080
you know,
what we learned later...

410
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,410
Uh, takin' off his flight suit.

411
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,910
And somehow he rolls the bird
on its side,

412
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,610
and just before it hits
the water, he jumps.

413
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:00,010
6,000 pounds
of angry helicopter parts

414
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,080
flyin' all around him.

415
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,450
And somehow he makes it.

416
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,740
How'd he do that?
I...

417
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,550
What are you sayin'?

418
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,670
Your husband, he said
he was gonna protect his family

419
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,850
no matter what.

420
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,700
And I acted like
i didn't understand, but... I do.

421
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,350
It's the rock
we all push... men.

422
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,700
We call it our burden,
but it's really our privilege.

423
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,410
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

424
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,780
You know?

425
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,250
Not to Ed.

426
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,140
Not to anybody.

427
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,500
I just wanted to be someone.

428
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,610
Well, you're somebody now.

429
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,650
No, see?

430
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,970
I wanted to choose,
be my own me,

431
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,850
not be defined
by someone else's expec...

432
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,140
And then, that guy...
That stupid guy...

433
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,270
Walked out into the...

434
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,480
Why'd he have to do that?

435
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,250
You mean the victim?

436
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,670
No.
That's not fair.

437
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
'Cause I'm a victim, too.

438
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,510
Was a victim first, before him.

439
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,710
Victim of what?

440
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,700
It's...

441
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,280
You wouldn't understand.
You're a man.

442
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,700
It's a lie, okay...

443
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,650
That you can do it all...

444
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,970
Be a wife and a mother
and this self-made career woman,

445
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,810
like there's 37 hours in a day.

446
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,510
And then, when you can't,
they say it's you.

447
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:21,650
"You're faulty,"
like... like...

448
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,540
Like you're inferior somehow.

449
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,170
And... Like... like,
if you could just get

450
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,250
your act together

451
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,040

Noreen:
Solverson residence.

472
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,500
Oh, thank god.
Who's this? Noreen?

473
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,550
Is that you,
Mr. Solverson?
Yeah.

474
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,140
We've been tryin' to...

475
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,370
I mean, all night,
we've been callin',

476
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,950
and the operator didn't know

477
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,200
where you were, and...
What happened?

478
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,610
Well, it's...

479
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,380
She's fine.

480
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,350
Just had a...

481
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,670
Well, she fell is all.

482
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,950
Something about

483
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,270
the pills they gave her.

484
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,710
What do you mean she fell?
Where's Molly?

485
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,610
She's here at home.

486
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,010
We all are.

487
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,280
Your missus is sleepin',

488
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,610
and the girl
right there with her.

489
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,840
She's stubborn,
all right, your daughter.

490
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,100
Your wife says
she gets that from you.

491
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,450
Uh, uh, but the doctor...

492
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,570
He says your missus is fine.

493
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,210
Just needs rest
and then to come in next week

494
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,710
for some more tests.

495
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,180
She's sleeping currently.

496
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,280
I told her I'd sit up with Molly
until you got home.

497
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,780
Okay, well, uh, I've got
a suspect in custody,

498
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,410
on my way back from sioux falls,

499
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,850
so, uh, tell Betsy
I'll be home soon as I can.

500
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
Okeydokey.

501
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,570
Uh, and, Noreen, thank you.

502
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,150
You betcha.

503
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,910
And so... Great empires fall
and are forgotten.

504
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,910
You're thinking,
"why 'tripoli'?"

505
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,650
Well, tripoli,
not to be confused

506
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,470
with levantine tripoli
in the country of Lebanon,

507
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,810
was founded in Libya
in the seventh century

508
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,240
by the phoenicians,

509
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,470
then was conquered
by the romans.

510
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,310
And then by the Spanish,
and then by the turks.

511
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,110
You see where I'm going.

512
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,940
I need a face man.

513
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,300
His details are inside.

514
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,650
I'm assuming you want
more than just a skin peel...

515
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,700
Something structural...

516
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,100
A whole new man,

517
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:13,310
like the Phoenix rising
from the ashes.

518
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,780
What'll you do then, i wonder?

519
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Join a-a new empire?

520
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,310
Maybe start one of my own.

521
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,110
So that it, too,
may one day collapse

522
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,050
and fall into the sea.

523
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,380
Do I take it you'll try
to get revenge on Kansas City,

524
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,050
apprehend those responsible?

525
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,300
'Cause you can bet Kansas City
will be heavily guarded.

526
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,350
Not apprehend.

527
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,870
Dead.

528
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,350
Don't care
"heavily guarded."

529
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,440
don't care
"into the sea."

530
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,950
Kill and be killed.

531
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,610
Head in a bag.

532
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,810
Young man: Dummy!

533
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,720
♪♪

534
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,310
Hamish:
Look, you did good.

535
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,150
I had my doubts, but, uh,

536
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,270
you really brought
this thing home.

537
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,110
I had a few breaks.
Don't do that...

538
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,110
Take praise and turn it
into something else.

539
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,350
All right, I'm sorry.

540
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,970
And don't apologize.

541
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,610
You've still got
a few rungs left to climb.

542
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,300
You're not gonna get there
saying you're sorry.

543
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,010
Got it.
Thank you, sir.

544
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,640
I did.

545
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I worked hard night and day
to get this done.

546
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,540
I don't mind telling you.

547
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,940
Which is why I was thinking,
for this setup in Fargo,

548
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,840
I'd like to handpick a few men.

549
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,940
No, no, no, no.
That's the day-to-day stuff.

550
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,600
We've got a team for that...

551
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,800
Asset managers,
mid-level and below.

552
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,040
Drones, really.

553
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,600
They've already been deployed.

554
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,940
The real oversight
of the new northern territories,

555
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,000
well, that happens right here
in this building.

556
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,210
Which is where you want me.

557
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,150
Assuming you don't want to be
a grunt your entire life.

558
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,370
No.

559
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,650
Of course not.

560
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,710
Good.
Then pay attention.

561
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,040
It's, uh,
9:00 to 5:00, mostly,

562
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,070
but management rewards
initiative,

563
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,750
so, uh, nights, weekends,
whatever gets the job done.

564
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,700
You'll be working closely
with the accounting department,

565
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,740
looking for ways
to optimize revenue...

566
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,600
Shorter shipping routes,
less palms to grease,

567
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,200
that kind of thing.

568
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,080
The accounting department?
Yeah.

569
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,050
And this whole,
uh, western thing...

570
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,570
That's got to go.

571
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,350
Get something gray or pinstripe
with a white shirt...

572
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
A-a-a-a real tie.

573
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
A-a-and cut
your hair, okay?

574
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,970
The '70s are over,
for Christ's sake.

575
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,940
See, I thought...
Well, in the old days,

576
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,200
when a guy conquered a place...

577
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,880
You want the old days?

578
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,610
Go work in a coal mine.
This is the future.

579
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,240
Look, you and I got off
on the wrong foot,

580
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,340
but you seem like a good kid,
so let me give you a tip.

581
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,840
The sooner you realize

582
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,340
there's only one business left
in the world...

583
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,640
The money business,
just ones and zeros...

584
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,600
The better off you're gonna be.

585
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,740
Sir, believe me, I'm an earner.

586
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,240
Yeah, yeah, but listen to me.

587
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,900
I'm not talking about
busting heads for collections.

588
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,650
I'm talking about profit
and loss... infrastructure.

589
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,100
See...

590
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,780
Last year, donahue,
in the western branch...

591
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,910
He rejiggered the mail room,

592
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,280
ended up saving $1 million
a quarter in postage.

593
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,450
Now, management
was so impressed,

594
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,400
they gave him California.

595
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,110
The mail room?
Yeah.

596
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,750
Why didn't I think
of that, right?

597
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,350
Uh, anyway, settle in.

598
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,640
Dale from h.R. Is
gonna come by

599
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,270
with a few forms
for you to fill out...

600
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,310
Health insurance, 401...
And then, uh, get to work.

601
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,450
Quarterly projections
and revenue statements are due

602
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,670
on the 13th.

603
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,910
We're expecting big things
from you.

604
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,580
Oh, um... You play golf?

605
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,250
Golf?

606
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,300
It's a great game.
You should learn.

607
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,080
It's where all the deals
are being done these days.

608
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,340
Look who I found.

609
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,590
Molly: Poppa!

610
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,840
Ow!
Oh, careful,
careful, now.

611
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,990
Could you... give
your poppa some room.

612
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,340
No, no.
Okay.

613
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,690
This is just
the medicine I need.

614
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,500
Are you okay, then?
You need to lie down, or...

615
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,870
Nah, no, no.
No?

616
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,670
I'll take a beer, though,
if you got one.

617
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,840
Lou?

618
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,060
Hell, yes.

619
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,970
I mean "heck."
"Heck."

620
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,870
I think
we earned one... or 10.

621
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,070
Hey, sheriff.

622
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,670
Noreen.

623
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,570
Heard you're, uh, runnin'
the place now.

624
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,300
Oh, it's mostly
just babysittin' and laundry.

625
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,840
She's been
a real life-saver.

626
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,960
Noreen:
Come on, squirt.

627
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,640
Let's get your party dress on.

628
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,360
See you in the funny papers.

629
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,470
More pie, dad?

630
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,040
Not unless you want me
to burst my stitches.

631
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,970
So...

632
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,000
You gonna put that
in your report, then?

633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,300
What?

634
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,770
"Gunfight interrupted
by spacecraft?"

635
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,040
Yeah.

636
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,390
Maybe leave that subtext.

637
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,940
And this hanzee fella?

638
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,090
Uh

639
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,870
Made the FBI's most wanted.

640
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,540
First one of those i worked.

641
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,690
But so far, nothing.

642
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,470
Probably fled the border
to winnipeg or points north.

643
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,740
Yeah.

644
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,060
He'll show up again, I'm sure.

645
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,570
Like it or not.

646
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,370
Are you okay, hon?

647
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,240
Yeah, sure.

648
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,490
It's just a cramp.

649
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,400
We're a sad bunch, huh?

650
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,400
Next thing, Lou'll be grouchin'
about his sciatica.

651
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,640
Hey.

652
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,870
Well, we're sitting here
together.

653
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,340
That's what matters.

654
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:34,460
A man once said, "you'll know
the angels when they come

655
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,770
'cause they'll have
the faces of your children."

656
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,840
Anyway

657
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,060
I'm just happy
to see you is all.

658
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,840
So, dad, I fed your cats
while you were in the hospital.

659
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,190
They're grateful,
I'm sure.
Yeah.

660
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:03,330
And... When I went over there
the first time,

661
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,990
I went in your office.

662
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,840
Ah.

663
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,490
So, uh...

664
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,160
Well, okay.

665
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,000
So...

666
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,070
A-after
your mother died,

667
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,540
I got to feelin' pretty low.

668
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,030
We all did.

669
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,430
And I took... well, you remember
i took some time off.

670
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,360
And i-i started thinkin',

671
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,040
which I know is dangerous.

672
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,860
But, you know...

673
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:52,540
The things I've seen,
you know, in the war...

674
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,060
And at home, on the job...

675
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,540
So... so much
senselessness,

676
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,090
violence, you know?

677
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,370
And I got... I got...
I got to thinkin' about...

678
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,940
About miscommunication.

679
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,430
Like, how...
Isn't that the root of it?

680
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,990
Conflict, war...
Does... doesn't it all come down

681
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,700
to... to language?
Right?

682
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,200
The... the words we say
and the words we hear,

683
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
which aren't always
the same thing.

684
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,100
So, I thought, you know,
what if there was

685
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,640
one language... a u... a
universal language of symbols?

686
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,760
'Cause pictures, to my mind,

687
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,000
are... are... are clearer
than words.

688
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,300
So that's
what that is...
Mm.

689
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,640
In your office?

690
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,960
You're making your own language.

691
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,940
Well, it sounds crazy when
you say it out loud, I know.

692
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,890
But...

693
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,100
You know, when we see
a-a-a box with a roof on it...

694
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,800
Well, everyone knows
that means "home," right?

695
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,300
You know, and my...
My 6-year-old granddaughter,

696
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,770
she draws a heart.

697
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,770
It means love.
No question.

698
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,100
Anyway... That's where I started,
you know, with simple ideas.

699
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,140
And... and the more
i worked on it,

700
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,930
the more it became
all I could think about.

701
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,190
You're a good man.

702
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,630
Well, I don't know
about that, but...

703
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,730
I like to think
i got good intentions.

704
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,160
What do you say
tomorrow we go fishin'?

705
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,140
Okay.

706
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,240
You get some sleep, you.

707
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,030
Good night,
Mr. Solverson.

708
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,060
Good night,
Mrs. Solverson.

709
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,200
And all the ships at sea.
