1
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,040
Ed, no.
Hank: Peggy, come here.

2
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,220
This is...
you're so out of line!
Peggy. Peggy.

3
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,640
You can't just ruin
people's lives!

4
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,310
Peggy, Peggy,
can you come back inside?

5
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,110
Huh? Come on. Come on.
Parade them around main street

6
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,940
for something they didn't do,
falsely accused.

7
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,780
No. Mnh-mnh.
Peggy.

8
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,450
No. You're not gonna prove
my Ed did anything wrong!

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,850
It's unprovable!

10
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,780
Heard about the fire.
You okay?

11
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,380
You didn't have to come down.

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,050
Mrs. Solverson.
Ed.

13
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,550
Worried about ya.

14
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,120
Feels like the top

15
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,640
might just spin right off
the globe these days

16
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,410
and take you along with it.

17
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,400
What's that for?

18
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm just imagining you

19
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,680
parachutin' into
the mekong delta,

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
telling the black pajamas
to leave your husband alone.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,780
Shoulda. Could've saved
a lot of lives

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,620
if wives and mothers
from both sides

23
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,370
came and dragged
their fool men home by the ear.

24
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,380
Anything I can do
to help this mess?

25
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,950
Uh, yeah. You can, uh,
take Noreen home with ya.

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,950
Her place burned down
with the shop,

27
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,080
and we both know she's just
a kid, emancipated or not.
Mm.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,920
Noreen.

29
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,910
Hey, Ed.
I told 'em what you said.

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,170
Quiet now, both of ya.

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,620
Come home soon.

32
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,410
We both know that's not likely.

33
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,220
Come on, dear. Let's get
you home and in a bath.

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,340
Betsy: I'll make us
some cocoa, all right?

35
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,280
She's a nice lady.
Shut up.

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,070
Time for your phone call.

37
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,810
♪♪

38
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,520
Five minutes.

39
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,640
I was thinking about elron
the other day.

40
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,410
Before.

41
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,110
His face, you know?

42
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,470
Trying to remember.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,250
I was 10 when they came.

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,810
Soldiers in uniform with that...

45
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,570
Folded up flag.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,820
You were in Chicago, i think.

47
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,820
Mom says.

48
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,210
There's that picture in the hall
of you and all the kids.

49
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,910
That winter in bear lake.

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,670
Everyone else in coats,

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,380
but elron's in a t-shirt,
makin' muscles.

52
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,750
What would he do now?

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,410
You know?

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,240
Now with this.

55
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,150
He was the oldest, right?

56
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,480
Not dodd.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,150
What?

58
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,320
Unka? Charlie's on the phone.

59
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,650
What?

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,570
Hey.

61
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,950
I get it.

62
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,250
You don't have respect
for anything.

63
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,280
But...

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,880
Do you know what
a whore's life is?

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,950
Come on, now.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,980
I'm serious. This is
me looking out for you.

67
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,750
Some career advice.

68
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,720
A whore's life is
five good years,

69
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,470
five bad years,

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,550
and then
some half-dick sweat stain

71
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,750
grinds you out like a cigarette.

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,650
Like a goddamn spent cigarette.

73
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,080
My son?

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
You sent my goddamn son!
Uhh!

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,380
You sent my...

76
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh, Jesus! Oh, cut it out!

77
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,820
Uhh!
Come on, bear.

78
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,310
Would somebody get him off me?

79
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,140
You better stop, huh?

80
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,050
Okay. You've been asking for it
for days.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,850
Tell your man walk away,
and we'll see.

82
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,380
And now it's time you're...
You're getting the belt, kid.

83
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,050
Strap or buckle?

84
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,820
You think you're...

85
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,870
Belt was dad's thing.
The kid said he was ready.

86
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,150
Said it should be family
that pulls the trigger,

87
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,550
which is true.

88
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,820
He's 17.

89
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,270
He's got a crippled arm.

90
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,450
Now, see, I don't see that.

91
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,450
I see heart and will.
I see spirit.

92
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,850
I see grandpa after the war.
Right, pop?

93
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,350
Grandpa, who stows away
on a boat,

94
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,120
comes to America,
and builds an empire.

95
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,770
Compared to that,
what have you ever done?

96
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,820
Or me? Arm or no arm?

97
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,340
Now, you can have the strap
or the buckle,

98
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,120
'cause I can't have you
knocking me around,

99
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,740
not in front of the men.

100
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,020
Give me that buckle,
you piece of shit.

101
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,540
That's my boy.

102
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,610
Floyd: No!

103
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,170
No!

104
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,950
None of your bullshit!

105
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,620
Not today.

106
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,570
You'll kill us all.
You'll split this family apart!

107
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,440
Now tell me what happened.

108
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,410
Bring back my grandson.

109
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,010
No excuses.

110
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,440
I'll call up to winnipeg,
tell 'em he's coming.

111
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,750
He can stay there
till things cool down.

112
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,510
And you...

113
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,940
While he's seeing to the boy,
you take care of this butcher.

114
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,580
He doesn't live through
the night.

115
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,620
Already dead, believe me.
He just doesn't know it.

116
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,610
This better be
state secret-level information.

117
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,340
They all left.
Who all?

118
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,280
Dodd and bear
and maybe half a dozen...
going?

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,850
He called me a whore.

120
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,950
Well, darling...
Technically...

121
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,480
It's my body.
I got every right.

122
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,850
Of course you do.

123
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,650
We're in full agreement,
you and me.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,250
A beautiful body, and you can do
what you want with it.

125
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,680
But right now
i need you to tell me.

126
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,310
Your dad and the others,
where are they headed?

127
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,210
They're going to that town
in Minnesota where the judge...

128
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,240
Luverne.
Yeah.

129
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,480
Luverne.

130
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,380
And I want...

131
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,020
You're gonna...

132
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Get the hell outta here.

133
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,640
Did I lose you there,
sweetheart?

134
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,680
You're gonna kill him for me.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,380
Your dad?
He's not...

136
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,920
Ozzie was a dad, on the TV.

137
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,040
Shit, Mr. French is
more of a...

138
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,550
How long ago did they leave?

139
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,550
Just...

140
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,820
Uh, maybe half an hour ago?

141
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,140
Took a whole army almost.

142
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,050
Okay, baby.

143
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,380
Any last message for your dad
when I see him?

144
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,910
Yeah.

145
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,010
Tell him...

146
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,140
Kiss my grits.

147
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,410
"'Twas brillig,

148
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,040
"and the slithy toves did gyre
and gimble in the wabe,

149
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,220

150
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,240
"And the mome raths outgrabe."

151
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,070
Mike:
"Beware the jabberwock, my son.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
The jaws that bite..."

153
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,070
"The claws that catch.

154
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,380
"Beware the jubjub bird

155
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,220

the frumious bandersnatch.

156
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,540

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,920

and with its head
he went galumphing back."

164
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,780
I got coffee from this mornin'.
I could heat it up.

165
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,360
Please.

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,520
Uh...

167
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,990
I'm gonna move these, okay?

168
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,660
No. Actually, no.
Those are my... no!

169
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,250
No, put them down.

170
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,080
Oh. No problem.

171
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,160
I just got that organized.

172
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,120
So, you... you collect these,
then?

173
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,290
The beauty and travel mags.

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,790
No, not collect.
I...

175
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,120
I gotta stay up with
the latest trends, you know,

176
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,820
in my line of work.

177
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,890
Well, that explains
the... the beauty mags.

178
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,160
Well, there's more to life
than Minnesota, you know.

179
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,680
Do you think, uh...

180
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,660
I-i know there's a lot
of questions, but I just...

181
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,410
I got a, um,
i got this seminar tomorrow,

182
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,990
lifespring, and, uh,

183
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,090
I gotta drive up to sioux falls
first thing, so...

184
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,860
Um...

185
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,410
Well, now, i-i got
five dead since Saturday,

186
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,560
including the one tonight
in the burned down butcher shop,

187
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,480
and your husband is
currently in jail,

188
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,990
so I wouldn't count on
getting there early.

189
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,420
No, I mean, that's terrible.

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,090
But what can Ed... I mean...

191
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,090
Attempted robbery
and those two men...

192
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,820
No, no, no,
it wasn't a robbery, Peggy.

193
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,190
Those men came for your husband.
They came to kill him.

194
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,420
You don't know that
for sure, sheriff.

195
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,890
You're just trying to be
dramatic, trying to scare me.

196
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,260
I assure you, I am not.
And when I say five dead,

197
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,650
I'm only talking about
inside the city limits.

198
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,410
Reports are 15 more bodies...
15 more bodies up in Fargo.

199
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,760
This is a turf war
between the Kansas City mob

200
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,050
and this Gerhardt family you've
gotten yourself mixed up with.

201
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,450
Stop saying that.

202
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,080
Me and Ed...
We're just bystanders.

203
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,920
Not even.
Uh, disconnected...

204
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,560
Him with the shop,

205
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,080
and... and me just trying
to actualize fully, ya know?

206
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,990
Be the best me I can be
because these are modern times,

207
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,720
you know, and a woman...

208
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,460
Well, she just doesn't have to
be a wife and a mother no more.

209
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,280
She can be...
There's nothing she can't be.

210
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,060
You're a little touched,
aren't ya?

211
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,820
What?

212
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,090
It's not that there's anything
wrong with that.

213
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,820
Don't get me wrong.

214
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,060
It's just, uh, the time
and place in which you're...

215
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,050
Well, you know, if you mean
i got dreams, then yeah.

216
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,780
And... maybe I don't
see it all like everybody else,

217
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,560
but I got plans.

218
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,080
We... we got plans,

219
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,490
and you can't just
come in here...
Yeah, Peggy?

220
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,920
And derail...
they tried to kill
your husband.

221
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,960
I mean, they burned down
his shop.

222
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,180
You think that's the end of it?

223
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,660
Well, I mean... Look, right?

224
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,180
Ed... he really...
He loved that place.

225
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,990
But life's a journey, ya know?

226
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,960
That's what John hanley sr.
Says.

227
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,810
He's the founder of lifespring.

228
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,160
Life's a journey,

229
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,010
and the one thing
you don't do on a journey

230
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,220
is stay in one place, right?

231
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,690
So maybe we'll...

232
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,290
I don't know,
go to California or...

233
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,820
California?
Someplace,

234
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,290
now that the shop's gone.

235
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,490
Peggy...

236
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,790
Before you, uh...

237
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,320
Before you start making plans,

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,860
you should know I got
a forensic team coming down

239
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,980
from the twin cities
in the morning.

240
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,720
And I know it's been repaired,

241
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,520
but we're gonna check your car
for blood.

242
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,790
Microscopically, I mean,

243
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,160
which... You'd be amazed

244
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,680
at what we can find
on the atomic level these days.

245
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,460
No. I mean...

246
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,010
Y-you can't do that,
of course,

247
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,690
without permission from
the owner, you know, so...

248
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,760
Oh, we got permission,
about an hour ago.

249
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,450
You sold the car to Sonny greer,
didn't ya?

250
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,450
Earlier at the body shop.

251
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,510
And Sonny now is
the owner of record,

252
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,760
and he was more than happy to...
No. No, you can't.

253
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,210
That's...
Hold... hold on.

254
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,020
Peggy. Peggy.
I'm serious now.

255
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,390
Better you tell me before I get
a fistful of evidence.

256
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,420
What happened that night

257
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,020
when you hit Rye Gerhardt
with your car?

258
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,420
I-I'm the victim here, Lou.

259
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,290
Ed.

260
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,920
I mean, 'cause...

261
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,020
I sat in your living room
last night

262
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,590
and gave you the chance.

263
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,920
You and Peggy both, I gave ya
the chance to c...

264
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,520
I know,
but you gotta understand,

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,060
w-we're just trying to...

266
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,080
You know, me, I'm just trying
to protect my family.

267
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,820
There was a cleaver
in the man's head, son,

268
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,320
which Noreen said was you.

269
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,280
Not to mention there's a war
going on up in Fargo

270
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,820
that you may have started

271
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,620
when you ran over that
Gerhardt boy in Peggy's car.

272
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,960
You or... or... or...
Or Peggy or both.

273
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,110
This is all just so crazy.

274
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,680
And I can't stop thinking
about that book.

275
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,620
Noreen's book.
It's, like, stuck in my head.

276
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,990
What? What book?

277
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,590
It's about this guy
who, every day,

278
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,520
he... he pushes this rock
up this hill.

279
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,790
Like a Boulder.

280
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,490
And then every night,
it just rolls back down.

281
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,820
But he doesn't stop.

282
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,020
You know, he just...
He keeps goin'.

283
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,820
And... and he wakes up every day
and starts pushin'.

284
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,860
By which i-i-i guess
I'm... I'm sayin'

285
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,650
it doesn't matter what
they throw at me.

286
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm gonna take care
of what's mine.

287
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,310
And...

288
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,250
These boys aren't gonna rest
until you're dead, son.

289
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,150
Possibly Peggy, too.

290
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,320
I want a lawyer.

291
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,320
Lou, i-i...

292
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,890
I need one.
I'm... I'm askin' ya for one.

293
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,220
Ed, that's not...
No, i-i seen the shows...

294
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,690
You don't...
On TV.

295
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,720
You don't...
I seen the shows on TV.

296
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,760
"Ironside" and...

297
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,660
This is all too important
to make mistakes here.

298
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,910
So get me a lawyer,

299
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,390
a good one.

300
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,220
And if he says...

301
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,660
Then I'll... I'll talk.

302
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,550
No, Sonny, they just
called themselves plumbers,

303
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,210
but what it was,

304
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,920
was a special investigative unit
inside the white house.

305
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,590
Bluth: Hey, Karl.

306
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,660
Percy.
Got a customer for you.

307
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,510
A client, I guess you'd...

308
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,160
Over at the station.

309
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,450
Ed blumquist?
Butcher's assistant?

310
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,650
I guess he's mixed up
in all the craziness.

311
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,780
You hear that, Sonny?

312
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,660
There's a crisis at the highest
level, so who do they call?

313
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,110
The best lawyer in town.

314
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,260
Aren't ya the only lawyer
in town, Karl?

315
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,950
Yes, but that's because
i scared away all my...

316
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,080
Oh. Great Caesar's ghost.

317
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,990
Would appear
I'm a little unstable. Um...
Okay there, Karl?

318
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,920
Want me to tell Lou
you need a few hours?

319
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,660
Fair-may ton bush, son.

320
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,780
I am sound in mind and body

321
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,290
and ready to run circles around
the inferior minds

322
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,760
of the rock county
sheriff's department.

323
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,210
Lou is a state cop, Karl.

324
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,320
Shut up, Sonny.

325
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,750
Will need you to drive, however.

326
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,790
♪♪

327
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,010
My question for you is,

328
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,790
how come after you hit
that fella,

329
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,290
you didn't just drive
to the hospital

330
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,960
or waved at a passin' motorist

331
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,010
and ask 'em to call the cops?

332
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,470
You say it like these things
happen in a vacuum.

333
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,700
Like it's a test.

334
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,690
Check "a" or "b."

335
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,660
But it's like...

336
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,710
Decisions you make in a dream,
ya know?

337
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,010
I'll tell you what,

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,330
if it was me,
and we had to run...

339
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,790
I wouldn't look back.

340
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,460
For what? The dazzle?

341
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,240
This house?

342
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,900
This is Ed's house.
He grew up here.

343
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,830
His mom washing his undies,

344
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,640
his father taking his paper
to the commode.

345
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,300
You ask me how come I buy
all these magazines?

346
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,130
I'm livin' in a museum
of the past.

347
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,130
Okay.

348
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,840
You stay here.

349
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,770
Sheriff?
Go inside now, Peggy.

350
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,540
You got a hiding place
in the basement or the attic,

351
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,300

What about you?

352
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,190
Go now.

353
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,800
And don't come out,
no matter what ya hear.

354
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,630
Hey.

355
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Hello.

356
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,560
Help you fellas with somethin'?

357
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,540
Hope so.

358
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,110
Ed home?

359
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,230
Ed who?

360
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Oh. Ed.

361
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,570
Yeah.

362
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,370
Yeah.
Yeah, ya just missed him.

363
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,670
Whole squad took him to
the station about an hour ago.

364
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,170
And that's the, uh,

365
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,200
the well-guarded
and impenetrable police station

366
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
on Hazel Lane.

367
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,110
Which... don't let the name
fool ya... is a fortress.

368
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,130
Or maybe he's inside
and you think I'm stupid.

369
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,140
Son...

370
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,010
I could fill out a steamer trunk

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
with the amount of stupid
i think you are.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,130
But no, that's...
That's where he went.

373
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,500
Yeah, that's what I thought.

374
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,690
Here we go.

375
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,690
No, Peggy, hey, hey.

376
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,000
Uhh!

377
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,500
Said the butcher's
down at the precinct.

378
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,730
Could be bullshit.
Take polk and Carter.

379
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,610
I'll clean up here.

380
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,940
Man: All clear upstairs.

381
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,560
Man:
Here, kitty, kitty.

382
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,170
Come, kitty.

383
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,870
Kitty.

384
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,340
Here, kitty, kitty.

385
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,530
Uhh!

386
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,300
Shut up.

387
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,960
Shut up, you fool.

388
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
Uhh!

389
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,840
Shit.

390
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,300
When I find ya, darlin',
I'm gonna make you bleed.

391
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,940
Uhh!

392
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,230
Bitch.

393
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,960
Hon.

394
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,970
Yeah?
Don't leave.

395
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,210
Wanna talk to you

Are you with us?

397
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,640
When you say "us"...

398
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,210
I mean the family.
All of it.

399
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,770
You don't get
to pick and choose.

400
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,660
Sure, grandma.

401
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,540
We all got a role to play.

402
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,970
You need to take my example.

403
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,670
Be a leader.

404
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,000
This is our time.

405
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,930
No such thing as men's work,
women's work anymore.

406
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,610

Hey, Denise.
For the rights of free men!

418
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,700
Hey, Karl, Ed's in back.

419
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,990
Rights that were squeezed
from British oppression

420
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,120
like water from a stone!

421
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,030
That all men are created equal,

422
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,330
free from the jackboot tyranny
and gulag magic tricks

423
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,000
of nameless,
faceless committees.

Hey.
Hope they didn't wake ya.

Outta my way, tool of the state,

426
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,160
for I am come to comfort
and counsel my client,

427
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
even as you seek
to prison him...

428
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,700
Yeah, whatever you're gonna do,
you got 30 minutes.

429
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,890
Don't dictate terms to me,
you rogue,

430
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,520
for the law is a light
on a hill,

431
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,000
calling to its breast
all those in search of justice.

432
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,850
To whit, this poor,
mottled wretch in front of me.

433
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,000
Hey, Karl.

434
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,890
Edward.

435
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,390
What a sad and fortuitous day...

436
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,520
You chained to that table,

437
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,360
and me...
No, I'm... I'm not in cuffs.

438
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,230
Chained in thought,
if not action.

439
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,860
At the mercy of
a cold and venal...

440
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,000
I-i-i didn't do this thing
that they're...
no, no.

441
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,790
Don't tell me.

442
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,390
The establishment
has ears everywhere,

443
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,950
even here.
Ears?

444
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,460
Instead, I shall simply ask
"g" or "n.G."

445
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,450
And you, my client,

446
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,550
will shake your head
in the affirmative

447
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,220
for the letter or letters
that best describes your status.

448
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,530
So i-i-i shake my head "yes."

449
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,630
Let's say for the purposes
of the cameras

450
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,000
that are no doubt watching...

451
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,990
That a negative shake
side to side

452
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,950
shall in this case
be a positive affirmation.

453
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,360
Remember, only shake once.

454
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,700
"G."

455
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,550
Or...

456
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,320
"N.G."

457
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,050
Well, son, rest assured...

458
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,830
Whatever your status,

459
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,360
I shall defend you
till your last breath.

460
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,060
I mean my last breath.

461
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,860
Excuse the obvious
death penalty snafu.

462
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm slightly inebriated.

463
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,760
Still got 26 minutes.

464
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,630
And that,
by no strange coincidence,

465
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,460
is the amount of time
it'll take me

466
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,420
to rouse judge peabody
from his bed

467
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,730
and have him dismiss
these unfounded charges.

468
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,100
No charges as of yet.

469
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,350
Held without charges.
Even better.

470
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,060
Then I shall have to tell
his honor to boost my client

471
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,730
from these baseless...
Whoa.

472
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,560
Baseless restraints
you've shackled him under.

473
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Hey, you're not drivin', are ya?

474
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,260
My choices outside this building
are none of your...

475
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,760
But no.

476
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,630
Sonny valeted me here tonight.

477
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,360
But now...
Now I must bid you all adieu

478
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,030
and admonish you to watch
your proverbial butts,

479
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,700
for I shall be back
with a sledgehammer of justice

480
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,420
prepared to lay Joseph waste
to these four walls

481
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,930
if you so much as touch a hair
on my client's...

482
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,930
Karl?

483
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,200
The jackboots are upon us.

484
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,090
Deputy bluth, I need you to lock
the back door.

485
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,450
Do it now.

486
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,790
Garfield, kill the lights
in back.

487
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,620
Denise, get on the horn
to h.Q.

488
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,200
Tell 'em we need every man
available yesterday.

489
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,350
There's a lynchin' party
outside.

490
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,100
Denise: Shouldn't call
the sheriff first?

491
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,750
Oh, you can try, but somehow,
i don't think he'll answer.

492
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,500
If he does, tell him
not to do anything heroic

493
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,950
until reinforcements arrive.

494
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,830
You okay there, counselor?

495
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,830
It's possible I soiled myself.

496
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,900
Bear: Here for my boy.

497
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,590
Doesn't have to get any more
complicated than that.

498
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,850
Met you before, at the compound.

499
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,330
So you know.

500
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,000
Already called for backup
on the radio.

501
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,530
Nobody's comin'.
Oh, they'll come.

502
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,200
State police up in Marshall
or sheriff out of nobles.

503
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,150
30, 40 minutes.

504
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,260
Maybe we got a trap set.

505
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,330
It's possible.

506
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,060
Just gonna keep comin', though.

507
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,730
After wounded knee.

508
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,160
Hell, the governor may send in
the national guard.

509
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,550
We got your son
on attempted murder.

510
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,690
Took a shot
at the local butcher.

511
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,250
The place burned down.

512
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,920
Where's that butcher now?

513
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,230
No.

514
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,430
I know you got designs on him.

515
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,330
He inside?

516
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,330
He's safe, guarded by armed men.

517
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,100
No.

518
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,920
No, he's not.

519
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,500
This kind of thing
didn't work in westerns

520
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,320
and it's not gonna work tonight.

521
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,460
We got enough men and guns
to hold you off till mornin'.

522
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,920
Maybe I got a trunk
full of dynamite.

523
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,730
Blow my way in.

524
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,930
Either way,

525
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,600
you got until the count of 50
to send my Charlie out.

526
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,930
Who's this Charlie now?
Karl, I'm serious.

527
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,560
I need you to sit over there
and stay out of the way.

528
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,720
Deputy, how we doin' securing
the back of the buildin'?

529
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,130
Uh, well, I mean,
i locked the door.

530
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,060
Well, let's barricade that,
yeah?

531
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,130
Shades down on all the windows.

532
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,660
We got any lightbulbs?

533
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,220
Lightbulbs?

534
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,660
I want you to take
all the lightbulbs we got,

535
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,950
smash 'em up
by the back doors and windows.

536
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,800
That way we can hear 'em
if they try to sneak in.

537

Oh. That's good thinkin'.

538
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,800
Need your help here.

539
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,820
Thought you had backup coming.

540
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,730
Closest men are outside nobles,
an hour away.

541
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,460
Plus, you're talking about
farm boys

542
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,350
who've never been face-to-face
with a serious man before.

543

That.

545
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,850
And I need someone who can
talk some sense into the father.

546
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,320
Who better than
the son's lawyer?

547
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,960
Don't represent the son, though.

Well, let's call it that

Truth is,
there's a lynch mob outside

Come on.

It's my name.

I'm your son's attorney.

Don't need a lawyer.

Yes, sir.

You mind if I...

592
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,910
As your son's man...

593
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,320
i spoke with a constabulary
at the highest level.

594
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,640
And they're prepared
to meet your demands.

595
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,310
Send the boy out.

596
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,650
Processing him now.

597
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,210
But as his lawyer...
Don't need no lawyer.

598
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,050
I told you.
As his lawyer,

599
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,110
I gotta advise you
of somethin', which is this...

600
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,320
You're makin' it worse.

601
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,650
He's a minor, see? Only 17.

602
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,240
So, reduced sentencin' applies.

603
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,380
Shh.

604
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,880
Karl: And yes,

605
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,250
witness puts a gun in his hand
with a shot fired,

606
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,640
but it's a miss.

607
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,140
You understand?

608
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,280
A miss, so even if
they convict him,

609
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,940
it's attempted at best.

610
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,910
The maximum is 10 years.
He's out in 5 for good behavior.

611
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,650
Done.

612
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,080
But this?

613
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,140
You take him outta here now,

614
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,410
and he's runnin'
the rest of his life.

615
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,090
A wanted fugitive,
shoot on sight.

616
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,150
But there's a way out.

617
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,940
Leave now, take your men,

618
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,410
and none of this falls
on the kid.

619
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,750
This is the deal I made.

620
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,610
He stays clean,

621
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,990
but you gotta go... Now.

622
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,290
Maybe we leave Charlie,

623
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,980
just take the butcher, huh?

624
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,380
Well, now, that's a problem.

625
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,980
See, any movement there,

626
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,210
and they loop the kid in,
make him an accomplice.

627
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,050
Kidnappin',
conspiracy to commit murder,

628
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,710
assaultin' a police officer
or worse.

629
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,490
So, we're back to the best thing
for the kid

630
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,510
being a fast retreat
on your part.
