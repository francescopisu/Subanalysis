1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,380
<i>Erstwhile on "Fargo"...</i>

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,500
I'm not afraid of a war.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,740
But are you with me?

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,710
We're not gonna make
the first move.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,330
But if these Kansas City mooks
come at you shootin'...

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,330
...we'll cut the goddamn nose
off their face.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,580
Your Indian killed him.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,270
I didn't know
that was happening.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,830
I wanna know what they're
gonna do before they do it.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,010
Otherwise, you can die
with the rest of them.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,080
You sent my goddamn son!

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,330
The kid said it should be family
that pulls the trigger,

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,440
which is true.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,040
He's 17.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,110
Sheriff?
Go inside now, Peggy.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,640
When I find ya, darlin',
I'm gonna make you bleed.

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,170
And that --
there's a word for that.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,630
It's called "managing up."

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,340
Which, if you want to rise
to any kind of power

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,110
in this organization,

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,940
is something
you'd better learn.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,440
Because they'll say to you,

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,140
"go out, do the job,
and don't worry."

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,510
But, in fact,
what they mean...

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,670
...is talk 'em through it.

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,670
You understand?

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,170
It doesn't matter

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,230
if it's washing machines
or cocaine,

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240
whores or horseradish,

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,180
they --
the powers that be --

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,770
they need to know...

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,080

don't like funerals.

57
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,830
Simone:
Nobody<i> likes</i> funerals.

58
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,710
I want to thank you boys

59
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,540
for coming out from buffalo
and helping us out.

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,980
We couldn't have
fought them off much longer.

61
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,000
Forget about it.

62
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,740
I'm seeing cows, horses,
whaddya? Chickens.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,610
It's like wild
goddamn kingdom in here.

64
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,870
We got
ups and downs.
Tell me.

65
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,600
Go see to lunch.

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,010
I'm grown.
I can hear.

67
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,340
We got five of theirs,
including management.

68
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,180
But they felled
roost and Seymour.

69
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,400
That means
south Dakota's turned.

70
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,740
Which bear now tells me
is where

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,040
they got
the presidents' faces

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,180
up on the side
of a rock.

73
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,900
So we should
get that back.

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,180
Nothing from Hanzee?
Nothin'.

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,500
Two days.

76
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,240
What about my dad?

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,130
Gonna need a third hole
is my feelin'.

78
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,280
Have some respect.

79
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,130
My lion
didn't raise that boy

80
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,280
to be killed
by small-town muscle.

81
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,600
Thought that about Rye.

82
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,780
Now there's nothin' left
but clothes.
They're just men.

83
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,410
What are you sayin'?

84
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,340
I said, it's not like my dad's
the shark in that movie --

85
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,840
"we're gonna need
a bigger boat."

86
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,810
He shits and sleeps.

87
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,640
I swear, I thought your father
was the problem --

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,740
his nature...
And towards women.

89
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,110
But you're two of the same!

90
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,640
You're porcupines!

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,310
You're half crazy,
always lookin' for a fight!

92
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,910
This family...

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,180
Deserves the ground.

94
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,670
I got this.

95
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,800
Hey, porcupine?

96
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,240
Hey.
Where are you running?

97
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,080
I shouldn't have
hit her.
Hey.

98
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,870
Hittin's the least of it.

99
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,830
Not enough of us left
to start tellin' the truth.

100
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,810
Simone: Go to hell.

101
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,580
Last stand
or make a run for it?

102
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,070
Benjamin.
Floyd.

103
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,730
It's funeral day.
I know.

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,240
Uh, we waited till
the dirt settled, but...

105
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,330
...now I need you
to come with us.

106
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,180
It's me
you should be takin'.

107
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,830
No, you're good.

108
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,340
Floyd?

109
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,110
How's my boy?

110
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,580
State pen --
awaitin' trial.

111
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,630
You should visit.

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,910
Where's your brother?
Found Jesus.

113
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,910
Mm.
Joined a monastery.

114
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,810
Mm. I just bet.

why is Floyd Gerhardt
sittin' in my interview room?

123
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,490
Schmidt: Sir, uh,
trooper Solverson and myself,

124
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,740
we're tired
of playin' clean-up --

125
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,590
officially.

126
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Thought we'd apply some pressure
to both sides.

127
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,670
Let 'em know all this killin'
isn't, uh, goin' unnoticed.

128
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,490
What about this butcher?

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
We got an apb out
on both blumquists,
ed and Peggy.

130
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,700
So far, nothin'.

131
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,400
Could be on the run,
could be dead.

132
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,340
Should've
checked on that girl.

133
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,090
Elliot ness himself
deputized my daddy atf

134
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,600
during prohibition.

135
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,570
Used to tell stories
of Tommy-gun bloodbaths

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,160
and heads
rollin' in the road.

137
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,260
Never thought I'd see it
in my lifetime,

138
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,990
but here we are.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,930
This thing's
just plumb out of control.

140
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,240
What do you think?
Mm.

141
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,330
I think I want
to live in a world

142
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,360
where people leave
the front door unlocked.
Yeah.

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,660
Probably we're just
wastin' our breath.

144
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,490
Okay.

145
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,870
You two go see
the out-of-towners.

146
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,760
Leave the old broad
to us.

147
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm gonna smoke.

148
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,570
Ma'am, I'm, uh,
sheriff Larsson, rock county.

149
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,020
Had some differences with
your oldest boy yesterday.

150
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,240
How'd that go for you?

151
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
Uh, let's call it a draw

152
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,070
on account of your Indian
sucker-punched me

153
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,430
'fore I could make
a showin'.

154
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,560
Yeah.
He does that.

155
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,160
Gibson:
Sorry to hear about Otto.

156
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,960
They shot him
in his own home.

157
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,120
These Kansas City
<i> hosenscheisser.</i>

158
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,640
Children sleepin' upstairs --
savages.

159
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,160
My wife passed
last summer.

160
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,230
We were up in brainerd,
visitin' my sister.

161
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,730
Last thing
she said to me --

162
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,630
"do you smell toast?"

163
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,300
Different roads,
same destination.

164
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,970
I suppose.

165
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,990
But the question is --
for you, I mean --

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,240
how far does it go?

167
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,630
Husband dead,
plus your youngest,

168
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,390
grandson in jail,

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,670
and now Dodd's missin',
we hear.

170
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,490
Old-timers had it worse.

171
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,370
Used to be 10 born,
2 survived --

172
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,390
consumption, scalpings,
smallpox, wolves.

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Well, it's a question
of what you can live with,

174
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,630
I suppose --
how many ghosts.

175
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,990
I-i shot a man through the teeth
in vichy, France.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,900
I still see his face
every night before bed.

177
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,790
Our backs to the wall.

178
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,170
You see that, yeah?

179
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,890
Yeah, except I'm the guy
in the next state

180
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,370
who got shanghaied,

181
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,490
and your sons are the ones
that took the drive.

182
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,870
The butcher of Luverne
killed my boy --

183
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,190
on orders
from Kansas City.

184
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh, I've known ed blumquist
since short pants.

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,130
If he's workin'
for the Kansas City mob,

186
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,800
I'll --
I'll cut off my toe.

187
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,960
What's it they call
those Russians?

188
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,060
Sleeper agents.

189
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm sayin',
you think you know someone,

190
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,300
but what do you know,
really?

191
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,100
I had a kid in here
the other day.

192
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Stabbed his parents to death
in their sleep.

193
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,770
When I asked him why,
he couldn't say.

194
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,230
It just come over him
all of a sudden.

195
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,790
The stories used to be simpler.
That's for sure.

196
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,200
This, then that --

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,970
and now I don't know

198
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,530
where it starts
or how it ends.

199
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,690
I truly don't.

200
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,600
Without bein' simplistic,

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,900
this thing's over
when you say it's over.

202
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,540
No. They won't stop --
my boys.

203
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,120
They've lost too much.
They're too proud.

204
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,130
Well, okay, then.

205
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,130
How about you
help us out?

206
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,370
You know
these Kansas City fellas.

207
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,690
Point us in
the right direction there --

208
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,240
you know, weaknesses,
indiscretions.

209
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,920
Give us somethin'
actionable,

210
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,670
and maybe we make
this whole, uh...

211
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Northern expansion
unpalatable.

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,130
Snitch.

213
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,670
Well, uh...
You said yourself --

214
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,160
hard to be simple
in times of complication.

215
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,090
<i>♪ With the sun down,

216
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,370

217

221
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,430
Oh, you son of a bitch.

222
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,860
Mike: Yes, sir. Maybe...

223
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,090
"Under control"
was the wrong phrase

224
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,770
given what's happened.
Hamish: You said --

225
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,560
when they killed bulo,

226
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,860
you said this Gerhardt outfit
was a stuffed shirt.

227
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,490
Now I'm standing here
with blood on my socks!

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,030
I can handle it.
The hell, you say.

229
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,700
Braverman stood for you,

230
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,440
said, "he's not like
the other darkies.

231
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,530
This one's smart,
capable."

232
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,060
Sir --
but that is not
what I'm seeing.

233
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,090
And I appreciate
the opportunity...Sir,

234
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,770
believin', as I do,

235
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,020
like the good Dr. king said,

236
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,440
"a man should be judged on
the content of his character,

237
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,730
not the color of his skin."

238
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,120
Yeah, he's dead.

239
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,470
You're gonna need
a different quote.

240
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,630
I can break this family.

241
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,790
Two weeks.

242
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,970
You got two days.

243
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,760
Then I'm sending
the undertaker.

244
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,230
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,960
Thank you, sir.

246
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,890
You son of a bitch.

247
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,440
You -- aah! --
Son of a bitch!

248
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,990
"Freedom,
that terrible word

249
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,130
inscribed upon
the chariot of the storm."

250
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,240
What?

251
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,890
You want me
to repeat it?

252
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,170
Is that a quote?

253
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Maybe.

254
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,560
What do you want,
little girl?

255
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,830
You were supposed
to kill my dad,

256
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,790
not the old cripple!

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,170
What's the difference?
What?!

258
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,590
To quote Louis xvi...

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>"Est-ce une révolte?"</i>

260
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,840
<i>"Non, sire.</i>

261
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,890
<i>C'est une révolution."</i>

262
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,960
The Duke of la rochefoucauld.

263
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
Are we gonna talk,

264
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,860
or are you just gonna quote
the thesaurus at me?!

265
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,830
I mean, if the goal is
to kill those who oppress you,

266
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,730
what does it matter
who goes first?

267
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,120
Because! I said!

268
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,170
Now, ironically,
in astronomy,

269
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,730
the word "revolution" means

270
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,460
"a celestial object
that comes full circle."

271
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,890
Did you know that?

272
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,300
Which, if you think about it,
is pretty funny,

273
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,570
considering here on earth
it means change.

274
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,020
You're nuts.

275
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,700
I'm talkin'
about a promise!

276
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,300
You could've killed me
shootin' up the house,

277
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,030
or grandma!

278
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,540
Unless...

279
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,030
Would you say
you're her favorite?
Who?!

280
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,240
The mater-familias.

281
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,060
In my experience,
the first-born granddaughter,

282
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,760
well, she's always
the shine on the apple.

283
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,190
Oh, god.

284
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,230
Help!

285
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,530
Unh!

286
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,270
Wow.

287
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,190
Lou:
You okay there, miss?

288
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,730
I am now.

289
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,020
Walk her out, huh?

290
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,900
What about you?
I'm not sayin'
"don't come back."

291
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,180
I'm a big girl.

292
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,270
You don't
have to nursemaid me.

293
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,170
Floyd know you're here?

294
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,430
Yeah.

295
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,410
Yeah, I've seen you around
up at the compound.

296
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,280
Seen me?

297
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,700
Or watched me?

298
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm aware, I'm sayin',

299
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,370
that the last place
you should be

300
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,330
is in a hotel room
with those fellas,

301
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,210
especially given
what's happenin'...

302
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,530
You won't tell, though.

303
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,430
Will you?

304
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,070
I don't...Have to.

305
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,780
Ohh!

306
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,270
Ow, Jesus!

307
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,170
Oh, Jesus!

308
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,430
Oh!

309
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,440
If I'm going to the noose,
I'm going,

310
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,180
but I'm done
lyin' down for men.

311
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,730
Schmidt:

312
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,710
Ohh!

313
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,910
Hey.

314
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,840
I, uh...

315
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,010
I just...

316
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,140
I was out of weed.

317
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,980
So I bought a dime bag
from, uh, packy.

318
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,770
You know, with the, uh...

319
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,410
Not safe around here
for us.

320
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,280
Simone: Yeah? Wow.

321
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,500
No one tells me nothin'.

322
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,600
But I'll...

323
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,300
Look, I can score weed
other places.

324
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,310
Thanks for the, uh...

325
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,110
Come on,
I'll give you a ride.

326
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,900
I got my car.

327
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,210
Ricky will
drive it back.

328
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,870
You two have fun,
huh?

329
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,130
Seat belt on.

330
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,840
So...Is this
a conversation about

331
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,910
how it's time for me
to pack up and go home?

332
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,840
No.
don't have to go home.

333
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,640
It's a big country.

334
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,880
Just maybe don't be<i> here.</i>

335
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,230
Are you familiar with the phrase
"manifest destiny"?

336
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,080
Yeah,
but see, here's the thing.

337
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,200
I own two pairs of shoes --

338
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,410
a summer pair
and one for winter.

339
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,610
We're not meant to have
more than we can handle,

340
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,300
is what I mean.

341
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,280
So, this need for conquest,
you know,

342
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,630
tryin' to own things
that aren't meant to be owned --

343
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,310
like people?

344
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,080
That's an example.

345
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,400
But also places --

346
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,940
believin'
we can tame things.

347
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,410
That's a problem, right?
Not a solution.

348
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,610
You're saying capitalism
is a problem?

349
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,630
No.

350
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,980
Greed.

351
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,270
Makin' this thing
all or nothin'.

352
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,230
Schmidt:

353
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,410
What happened to you?
Hmm?

354
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,540
What happened?

355
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,410
What happened?
Let's just get this
over with, huh?

356
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,270
So, you got a response
to my "all or nothin'" line?

357
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,170
Sometimes --
there's a man.

358
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,430
What -- what man?

359
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,180
Just a man.

360
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,470
He works in a factory.

361
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,470
One day, the boss gets it
in his mind

362
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,370
that this man
is stealing from him.

363
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,600
So, every night at the gate,

364
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,500
the guards
search his wheelbarrow.

365
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,170
But they never
find anything.

366
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,100
Pat him down.
Oh, they do that.

367
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,140
Strip him naked --

368
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,780
nothin'.

369
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,770
So...
He's not stealin'.

370
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,200
Of course he is.

371
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,200
Wheelbarrows.

372
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,980
Thank you.

373
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,700
That's right.

374
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,530
He's stealing
wheelbarrows.

375
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,530
What?

376
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,510
My point is

377
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,900
sometimes the answer
is so obvious

378
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,840
you can't see it
because you're looking too hard.

379
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,780
See, we can't leave
because we're the future,

380
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,570
and they're the past.

381
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,010
The past can no more
become the future

382
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,210
than the future
can become the past.

383
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,030
Okay.
We said our piece.

384
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,010
Just don't be offended
next time

385
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,940
if I don't say hello
before I shoot.

386
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,830
Geez!
Hmm?

387
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,580
Betsy:

388
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,330
Karl weathers,
that is a good way

389
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
to get yourself shot!

390
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,580
Your lesser half
gave us a key,

391
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,930
asked us to look out
for you and the little one

392
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,010
while he's gone.

393
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,730
Do I strike you as someone
who needs lookin' after?

394
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,110
You do not.

395
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,240
But he asked,
so here we are.

396
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,780
I'll sleep on the sofa.

397
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,570
Sonny's already called dibs
on the floor.

398
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,770
Wait, did what?
I'd give you the sofa, see,
except for my back.

399
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,500
What's the matter
with your back?

400
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,400
It hurts when I sleep
on the floor.

401
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,630
Eggs are done.

402
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,080
Pancakes are warmin'
in the oven.

403
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,470
You can fight me on
"are we gonna stay the night?"

404
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,670
Or you and the kid
can grab a plate

405
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,470

"the breakfast king of loyola."

Well, looks like
Floyd's gonna flip.

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah?
It took some doin',
but we convinced her

579
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,690
the only way this
thing was gonna end
up in the win column

580
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,840
was if she puts us
in the game.

581

Hmm.

582
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,840

My husband...

586
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,500
Second, I need assurances

587
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,070
that none of my children
or my grandchildren

588
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,500
are in line
for any repercussions.

589
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,500
This is my choice, my war.

590
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,600

Murder in the first

cover murder?!

Indian shot two troopers

What -- what Indian?
Ours.

625
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,670
The description matches

Witness said the, uh,
the Indian shot up a bar

629
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,510
and that he was lookin' for
a young couple --

One trooper dead,

00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,030
Still, pursuit means
they could be close, right?

637

Peggy and ed

If we're lucky, yeah.

Dodd's there.

the Indian.
Except, remember,

643

we just promised to give
the gerhardts a free pass.

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,410
Lenore, the older.
After high school.

661
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,160
She used to say,

662
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,040
"I'm gonna marry that boy
someday."

663
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,540
But then there was Vietnam,
and he joined up,

664
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,660
and she never was very good
at waitin'.

665
