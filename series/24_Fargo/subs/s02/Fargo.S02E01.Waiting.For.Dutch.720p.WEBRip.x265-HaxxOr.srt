1
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,640
Am I, uh...

2
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,400
What are we waiting for?

3
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,980
What?

4
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,010
The arrows.

5
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,080
Gayle's putting in the arrows
on Reagan.

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,180
Yeah, I know.

7
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,350
It's...
They said...

8
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,090
Jenny came by the trailer,
and she said five minutes, so...

9
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,870
Well, there's a lot of arrows.

10
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,470
So...

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,600
- Should I just go back to my...
- No.

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,980
No, it's, uh...
Jenny said...

13
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,440
What did Jenny say?

14
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,140
They're... they're...
they're putting in the arrows.

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,150
Yeah, I know.

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,220
But how long?

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,720
Doll, just find out,
will you?

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,920
'Cause the Chief is wearing
moccasins here.

19
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,350
It's goddamn February.

20
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,330
So, what's he like,
anyway?

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,330
Who?

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,660
Dutch. Reagan.

23
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,590
Ronnie?

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, he's a prince.

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,070
He's a real class act.

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,940
Yeah.

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,070
Can I get
a blanket?

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,640
This is the actual field,
they tell me.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,080
What?

30
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,540
It's the actual battlefield...
Massacre at Sioux Falls.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,750
I think 300 of your people...
braves...

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,430
died here, what,
100 years ago?

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm from New Jersey.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
Sure, but...
Yeah, you're... you're...

35
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,230
you're an Indian, right?
So...

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,330
so that... that...
that's got to be, uh...

37
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,610
Got to be what?

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,110
No, I'm just saying this battle,
it was the last big battle

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,250
before the end of the...
And what came after...

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,250
whew!

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,050
And, look, I'm a Jew,

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,250
so believe me,
I know tribulation.

43
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,920
Yeah. Smoke?

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,530
Any minute, he'll be out.

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,060
All right, nobody moves.
Everybody is still dead.

46
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,150
It is a crisis of confidence.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,330
It is a crisis that strikes
at the very heart and soul

48
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,540
and spirit of our national will.

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,340
_

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,240
We can see this crisis
in the growing doubt

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,650
about the meaning
of our own lives

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,080
and in the loss
of a unity of purpose.

53
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,390
_

54
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,220
Is he kidding me?

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,730
...has been taken out
of the home of John Wayne Gacy...

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,090
The erosion of our confidence
in the future

57
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,230
is threatening to destroy _

58
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,910
the social and the political
fabric of America. _

59
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,480
That's what I'm trying
to engage with here

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,440
is this untapped potential
of yours

61
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,140
to sort of think
a little bit.

62
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,780
♪ I can't sing, I ain't pretty
and my legs are thin ♪

63
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,880
Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,410
♪ I might not give a answer
that you want me to ♪

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,930

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,730
Hey, there. Sorry.

67
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,010
Are you kidding me?

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,400
You said noon, yeah?

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,180
Are you kidding me?

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,630
Hold on, now...

71
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,500
Said 11:00, not noon.

72
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,670
What?

73
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,110
Say that again.

74
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,940
- Okay.
- Say it again.

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,380
Okay, okay!

76
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,040
Where's the goddamn money?

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
I gave it to Ollie,
like, yesterday.

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,220
Don't lie.

79
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,450
I mean,
I'm... I'm getting it.

80
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,830
It's just a little late.

81
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,790
The hell you say.
I did the rounds.

82
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,990
Everybody paid.

83
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,330
'Course they're
gonna say that.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,860
So you got the money.

85
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, you know,
maybe I needed it for me,

86
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,490
for something I...

87
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,530
No, you earn for the family,
not for yourself.

88
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Yeah.

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
But you're the oldest,
and then there's Bear,

90
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,000
and that's the throne.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,300
What am I ever gonna be

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,040
except the kid you send out
for milk?

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,780
You're a Gerhardt.

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,480
That's like Jupiter
telling Pluto,

95
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,860
"Hey, you're a planet, too."

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,550
What?

97
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,120
If I'm this royalty,

98
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,520
how come you got me
doing bullshit collections

99
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,230
like some nobody chump?

100
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,630
Everybody earns.

101
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,990
That's the law.

102
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, but what if I got
ambitions, you know?

103
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,000
You wear short pants
till you prove you're a man.

104
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm a man.

105
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,330
You're the comic
in a piece of bubble gum!

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Well, I mean, says you.

107
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,410
You got till tomorrow to bring
the collection money you owe.

108
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,860
Or what?

109
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,790
You make me wait for you again,
I'll cleave your skull.

110
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,520
This is the month's cash,
all in.

111
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,880
You'll see the problem
right away.

112
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,350
Light.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Mm.

114
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,190
About time.

115
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,230
Give me a break.

116
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,630
Soon as you ladies
are done dancing...

117
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,670
You're right.

118
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,850
We're light,

119
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,650
even though
the transport dollars went up.

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,780
It's the local business...
gambling and drugs...

121
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,790
and whores.

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,660
<i>Meine keine gute soehne?</i>

123
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,860
Don't pin this on me.

124
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,130
Or me.

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
We earned.

126
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,700
But not Rye.

127
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,230
No.

128
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,690
But even without his nut,

129
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,400
we shouldn't be
this short.

130
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,260
It's like we're a balloon
leaking air all over.

131
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
Spit it out.

132
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,080
What are we talking
about here?

133
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,270
Tell me, God damn it.

134
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,270
Another outfit.

135
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,750
I'm taking care
of it.

136
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,250
From the south.

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't know where.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,280
- I said I'd handle it.
- They're coming hard.

139
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Son, I'm the iron fist
of God.

140
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,750
There's not a sane man
in three states

141
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,030
who would dare to...

142
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,100
Some pissant crew
from south no place?

143
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,870
You bring me these
<i>hirnlose mutter fotzen</i>

144
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
and I'll grind their bones
to make my...

145
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,180
Otto? Otto?

146
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,890
_

147
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
All right, hear me.

148
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm saying tomorrow
has never been closer

149
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,660
than it is right now.

150
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,480
It's 11:00
in the morning.

151
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,580
Metaphorically, I mean.

152
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,120
Hi, friend.
Be with you in a...

153
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,090
Check never came,
is my point.

154
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,700
I'm owed for work I done.

155
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,530
Me and the boys,
we're owed.

156
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,310
Giddyup there, cowboy.

157
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,380
Wait your turn,
short round.

158
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,510
What'd you say?

159
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,500
You heard me.

160
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,420
Jesus. Just...

161
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,140
It's in the mail, okay?

162
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,540
The check.

163
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,980
Just... if it hasn't come
by Tuesday,

164
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
I'll write you another.

165
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Yeah, that's right.

166
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,930
You better run.

167
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,290
Come on, now.

168
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,930
He could call a cop.

169
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,870
He's not calling anybody.

170
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,700
Guys like that, they're just big
on the outside.

171
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,080
So, where's this
miracle contraption?

172
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,870
Behold the future.

173
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,710
I'm talking money
hand over fist.

174
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
A typewriter.

175
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,260
A self-correcting IBM
Selectric II electric typewriter

176
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,880
with patented
high-speed type ball.

177
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,060
They're not just
for women anymore.

178
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,890
And you're sure
we're the only...

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,950
Sole distributor,
Midwest region.

180
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,590
Assuming you're willing
to forget certain debts

181
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,440
owed to your family
from the, uh...

182
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,690
Gambling.

183
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,200
Yeah, which, you know,
I'm not proud.

184
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,010
So, as soon as you talk
to the judge

185
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,480
and she unfreezes
the accounts,

186
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,150
well, then we can turn on
the money spigot.

187
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,650
The what?

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,010
The spigot.

189
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,450
It's like
where you hook up a hose.

190
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,450
Like a fire hose?

191
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,790
Any hose.

192
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm saying once we get
those typewriters,

193
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,630
the money...
there'll be no stopping it.

194
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,860

Yes, ma'am.

242
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,180
Hey. Your majesty.

243
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,250
You're gonna change your mind
about something... a case.

244
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
Or what?

245
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,910
Or you'll find out,
is what.

246
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,620
This isn't one of those optional
check "A" or "B" scenarios.

247
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,450
I'm gonna change your mind.

248
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,990
One day, the Devil came to God
and said,

249
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,430
"Let's make a bet
between you and me

250
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,820
for the soul of a man."

251
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,990
And from on high
they looked down on Job,

252
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,760
a devout man, religious.

253
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,760
And the Devil said,
"I can change his mind

254
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,270
and make him
curse your name."

255
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,750
And God said,
"Try and you will only fail."

256
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,950
So the Devil begins.

257
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,620
He kills Job's herds
and takes his fields.

258
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,020
He plagues him with boils
and throws him on the ash heap.

259
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,820
But Job's mind
remains unchanged.

260
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,120
So I ask you, son,

261
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,830
if the Devil couldn't
change Job's mind,

262
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,530
how the hell
are you gonna change mine?

263
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,190
What?

264
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,230
You're a little dim,
aren't you?

265
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,330
Listen, this is...

266
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,670
There's two ways
this can go.

267
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,410
- Is one of them the hard way?
- Easy...

268
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,070
You know what?

269
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,650
There's a fella needs to get
his hands on some typewriters.

270
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Ugh. Christ.

271
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,640
And you're gonna...

272
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,970
You're with that fool.

273
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,410
- Yeah. You're...
- Okay. _

274
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,520
Son, you have three second
to pick your ass up

275
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,950
and get out of here,

276
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,720
or I'm gonna squash you
like a bug.

277
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, look, bitch...
I'm the one do...

278
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,530
God damn, my eyes.

279
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,830
Now scram
before I call the cops.

280
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,810
Oh, crap.

281
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,970
Sh...

282
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,910
Shit.

283
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,310
Shit.

284
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,370
Shit.

285
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,570
Shit.

286
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,670
"'Oh, whocky!' Cried Joel.

287
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,740
'See what you've done,
Polly Pepper?'

288
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,340
but Polly didn't hear.

289
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,010
Over the big, flat door-stone
she sped and met Ben

290
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,310
with Little David
coming in the gate.

291
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
His face was just like
Phronsie's!

292
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,850
And with a cold,
heavy feeling at her heart,

293
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
Polly realized this was no play.

294
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,980
'Oh, Ben!' She cried,

295
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,910
flinging her arms
around his neck

296
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,450
and bursting into tears.

297
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,750
'Don't! Please.
I-I wish you wouldn't.

298
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,960
Phronsie's got 'em,
and that's enough.'

299
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,630
'Got what?' Asked Ben,

300
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,130
while Davie's eyes grew
to their widest proportions.

301
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,360
'Oh, measles!' Cried Polly,
bursting out afresh.

302
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,640
'Hatefulest, horridest measles!

303
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,370
And now you're taken!'

304
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,030
'Oh, no, I ain't,'
responded Ben cheerfully,

305
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,570
who knew what measles were.

306
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,710
'Wipe up, Polly.
I'm all right.'"

307
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,570
"'Only my head aches

308
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,340
and my eyes feel funny.'

309
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,990
Polly, only half reassured,
gulped down her sobs

310
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,220
and the sorrowful trio
repaired to mother.

311
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,750
'Oh, dear me,'
ejaculated Mrs. Pepper,

312
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,030
sinking in a chair at the dismay
at the sight of Ben's red face.

313
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,390
'Whatever will we do now?'"

314
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,590
This is a funny book, huh?

315
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,630
Yeah.

316
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,470
- Yeah.
- Phone call, hon.

317
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,630
It's the shop.

318
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,380
Okay, you.

319
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,380
Sleep, huh?

320
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,710
Okay.

321
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,540
I'll be back in a minute
to tuck you in.

322
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
Okay.

323
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,250
Murder, Eunice says.

324
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,650
Three of them
over at the Waffle Hut.

325
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,590
Hey, uh, you...
you had your thing today.

326
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah. This morning.

327
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,630
You feel okay?

328
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,600
Compared to what?

329
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,870
Love Canal?

330
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,040
Hmm?

331
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,140
Solverson.

332
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,640
Yeah, okay.

333
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,130
Tell him not to go inside.

334
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,870
Hank on his way?

335
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,210
Okay. You too.

336
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,380
Got to go, hon.

337
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,080
You okay
getting her to bed?

338
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,920
Yeah. She's six,
not, you know, Pol Pot.

339
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,750
Okay. Call if you need,
you know, whatever.

340
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,360
Mm-hmm.

341
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,690
I left my rig there.
I hope that's okay.

342
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm the one
who called it in, see?

343
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,590
Stopped for waffles,
you know?

344
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,330
With the blueberries.

345
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,810
They come frozen this time
of year, I know, but...

346
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,310
I-I put my coat on her.

347
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,190
It seemed only right.

348
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,100
Yeah.

349
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,610
"Yeah," it's okay
about the coat, or...?

350
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,360
Yeah.

351
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,420
Well, this is a deal.

352
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,760
I count three dead.

353
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,140
Saw the waitress
in the parking lot?

354
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,770
Mm.

355
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,730
I think she caught one there,
then staggered out.

356
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,170
Gunman followed,
made things permanent.

357
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,790
That's Henry Blanton.

358
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,260
Got the single-season touchdown
record in 10th grade.

359
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,720
31.

360
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,920
Still stands.

361
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,770
Yeah. Don't know her.

362
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,950
North Dakota plates
on a Mercedes outside.

363
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,820
Tourist,
you're thinking?

364
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,850
Mm...

365
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,300
How's Betsy?

366
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,030
You mean you didn't call her
before you came over?

367
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,890
Well, yeah.

368
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,490
Just being polite.

369
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,900
Give you a chance
to talk about your feelings,

370
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,840
should you be
so disposed.

371
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,510
She's good. Yeah.

372
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,110
Ordered this kit
of recipe cards.

373
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,520
Saw it on the TV.

374
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,350
So now every night,
we eat delicacies of the world.

375
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,980
Mm. Some men like that.

376
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,290
Variety.

377
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,050
Mm.

378
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,700
She put a soufflé
on the table last night...

379
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,870
perfectly good casserole...

380
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,120
and lit it on fire
with a kitchen match.

381
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,790
Huh?

382
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,630
Oh, which reminds me...

383
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,640
you're invited
for dinner tomorrow.

384
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,830
- 6:00?
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,500
I'll bring a suit of armor.

386
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,720
Skid marks.

387
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,520
Yeah. I see them.

388
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,880
'Course, connecting those
to this deal here

389
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,630
would be what we call
"jumping to a conclusion."

390
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,320
Based on
the number of bodies,

391
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,590
I'm thinking we've got one car
too many in the parking lot.

392
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,940
Yeah.

393
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,640
So, the shooter's got
a wound or two in him

394
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,080
from the steak knife.

395
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,940
Two blood trails lead out.

396
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,620
One to the waitress,
now deceased.

397
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,910
The other to the road here,
where he absconds,

398
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,750
leaving a few dollars
behind.

399
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,260
Uh-huh.

400
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,760
Why not take his own car?

401
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,620
Unclear at this time.

402
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,640
There's a shoe
in that tree.

403
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,240
There sure is.

404
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,670
So, uh, this a local matter
or do the State Police want it?

405
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,980
We do not.

406
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,590
Local matter it is.

407
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,920
And, of course, any support
the State can provide.

408
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,480
Yeah, of course.

409
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,280
See you tomorrow night,
then, eh?

410
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,180
6:00.

411
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,020
Be ready for anything.

412
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,400
That's a shoe, all right.

413
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,530
Okay, then.

414
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,280
Okay, then.

415
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,700
Noreen?

416
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,900
Hmm?

417
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,270
Ed's leaving.

418
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,330
Okay, then.

419
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,990
Oh, hey. May as well
take these with you.

420
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,600
Boolie Hendricks paid
but never picked them up.

421
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,600
Chops?

422
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Mm.
Wasted meat's a crime.

423
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,350
Or it should be.

424
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,350
Okay, then.

425
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,350
Okay, then.

426
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,610
Okay, then.

427
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,660
B-8. B-8.

428
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,100
So, Ho Chi Minh...

429
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,560
Jesus, kid. Keep up.

430
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,930
Ho Chi Minh
was just a front man.

431
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,270
Enemy number one
straight out of central casting.

432
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,420
AKA a stuffed shirt for
the military industrial complex.

433
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,840
The what's that, now?

434
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,750
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

435
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,480
Ike's farewell address?

436
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,020
The military
industrial complex.

437
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,080
Wheels inside wheels,
special interests.

438
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,520
N-33. N-33.

439
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,300
I thought
there'd be a band tonight.

440
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,870
- Boys.
- I-17.

441
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,400
I-17.

442
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,830
Balls.

443
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,540
Tell this dipshit pissant
about Ike's farewell address.

444
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,640
You mean
the military industrial complex?

445
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,750
See? He knows.

446
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,820
'Course,
we've been to war.

447
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,350
Nothing complex about it.

448
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,980
How come
you're in uniform, then, Lou?

449
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,530
Didn't you work
this morning?

450
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,090
Three dead
at the Waffle Hut.

451
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,350
No shit.

452
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,590
Yeah, a real mess.

453
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,130
Women, too.

454
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,420
Hank's thinking
botched robbery.

455
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,890
Oh, sure.

456
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,790
That's what
they <i>want</i> you to think.

457
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,060
Who?

458
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,130
They.

459
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,040
B-11.

460
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,530
You know,
the powers that be.

461
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,100
It's a classic story.

462
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,570
Oswald acted alone.

463
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,080
The girl
in the polka-dot dress.

464
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,210
The what, now?

465
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,920
The girl in the...

466
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,760
After Kennedy the other
was shot... Robert, in LA...

467
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,360
People saw a woman
in a polka-dot dress

468
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,430
running out of the hotel
yelling, "We got him!"

469
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,530
But who did they arrest?

470
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,030
I-23. I-23.

471
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,930
An A-rab. Racist pricks.

472
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,640
It's a diner robbery
in Minnesota, Karl.

473
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,940
Not a presidential
assassination.

474
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,300
Oh, sure.

475
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,780
That's how it starts...
with something small

476
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,050
like a break-in
at the Watergate Hotel.

477
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,320
But just watch.

478
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,220
This thing's
only getting bigger.

479
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,420
G-53. G-53.

480
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,290
Well, I better get home.

481
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,590
Betsy had
her chemo today.

482
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,130
God!

483
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,800
What is it, Karl?

484
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,370
It's just... God damn.

485
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,540
Unacceptable
is what it is.

486
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,610
A woman like that
in the prime of her...

487
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,540
With a young daughter.

488
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,100
N-40. N-40.

489
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,070
Tell her if John McCain
could hold out

490
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,650
for 5 1/2 years
against Viet Cong thumbscrews,

491
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,490
she can beat this cancer
bullshit in her sleep.

492
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,550

Your dad called.

520
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,320
You know him.

521
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,730
Likes to talk things through
before he goes to bed.

522
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,700
We got glasses.

523
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,880
Tastes different
in a glass.

524
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,530
Molly go down okay?

525
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,500
Mm-hmm.

526
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,040
Oh, you know,
I forgot earlier...

527
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,210
She made you something
at school today.

528
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,550
Yeah?

529
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,320
She knows
I don't smoke, right?

530
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,660
You could start.

531
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,230
Hmm.

532
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,160
Your dad said he'd be over
Sunday in a suit of armor.

533
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,570
Ugh. Geez.

534
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,010
You light one soufflé
on fire...

535
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,190
So, I'm getting excited
about this seminar.

536
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,720
- The which?
- You remember, hon.

537
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,650
It's next weekend.
Constance is taking me.

538
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,660
Lifespring.

539
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,190
Everybody's doing it.

540
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,920
Oh, yeah.

541
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,430
I really think this course

542
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,820
is gonna help me actualize,
you know, fully.

543
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,330
Re-examine
old reflex patterns...

544
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,230
the ones that keep my life
from working.

545
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,670
From...

546
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,630
'Cause <i>we're</i> doing great,
yeah?

547
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,570
Oh, yeah.

548
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,980
I just mean me, you know?

549
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,380
As a person.

550
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

551
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,210
Well, Bud asked again
if I was interested

552
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,380
in maybe taking over
the butcher shop.

553
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,750
Mm.

554
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,600
Said he's thinking of retiring
end of the year.

555
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,320
Just had
the end of the year, huh?

556
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,860
Yeah, I guess he means
this year,

557
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,770
but wouldn't that be great?

558
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,560
Me owning the shop,

559
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,300
maybe you take over
the salon one day.

560
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,180
You know, unless we got
a whole litter of kids by then.

561
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,080
Yeah, that's...
We talked about that.

562
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,420
We're trying,
but it takes time, you know?

563
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,390
Yeah.

564
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,090
Yeah, of course.

565
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,690
Though, uh... hon...

566
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,020
"trying"... I mean,
last time I checked,

567
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,960
there's just the one way
to make a baby, you know?

568
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,070
Did that last weekend,
didn't we?

569
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,370
It was Bear Lake last weekend.

570
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,460
You said
you didn't want to...

571
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,060
- not with Kevin and Sally...
- Hon.

572
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,500
I ju...  I just... uh...

573
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,170
I just love you, is all.

574
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,110
So, so much.

575
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,850
And, come on,
our kids would be amazing.

576
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,530
Oh, shoot!

577
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,460
Here.

578
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,790
Hon, let me...

579
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,360
No, it-it's fine.

580
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm... I'm such
a bumble sometimes.

581
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,800
What the heck?

582
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,630
I-I love you, too, hon,
so, so much.

583
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,310
Maybe we should...
Maybe do it right now.

584
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,440
Here?

585
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,340
No, silly.
In the bedroom.

586
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,510
Come on.

587
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,410
Geez. I better go see
what that...

588
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,990
We can...

589
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,790
I'll wear that nightie
you like.

590
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,850
What the...

591
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,660
Hon?

592
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,310
Didn't I tell you?

593
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,400
I kind of hit a deer.

594
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,440
You hit a...

595
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,580
Are you... you okay?

596
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,820
Yeah, no, I-I'm just,
you know, shook up, mostly.

597
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,350
Geez.

598
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,040
Well, insurance
should cover most...

599
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,160
Actually, I... I think
I need to sit down, hon.

600
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,910
Can we go
in the kitchen?

601
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,070
Heck, hon,
did you bring the deer home?

602
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,180
Hon, don't.

603
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,860
Hon.

604
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,820
Hon, don't.

605
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,690
Hon! Come back!

606
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,310
Don't.

607
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,310
Ah, geez.

608
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
T-there's a...

609
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,180
It's a man.
There's a man in the...

610
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,620
Oh, my God.

611
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,250
Oh, my God.

612
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,580
Oh... oh, my God.

613
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,260
Hon.

614
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,650
Geez, hon.

615
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,960
Sorry. Are y-you okay?

616
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,420
No, it's... I'm fine.

617
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,530
- Who...
- You got to believe me.

618
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,940
I-I thought he was dead.

619
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,270
What?

620
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,200
When I hit him,
I thought he was...

621
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,280
You hit <i>him?</i>

622
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,180
You hit <i>him</i> with the car?

623
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,470
You... you said a deer.

624
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,680
You hit him.

625
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,550
Why... why didn't you go to
the police or the hospital?

626
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,340
He ran out
into the road, hon.

627
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,180
What was I supposed to do?

628
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,130
Yeah, so...
so you brought him home,

629
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,500
made dinner...
Hamburger Helper.

630
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,230
I panicked, okay?

631
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,340
We... we got to call
the police.

632
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,850
Why didn't you call
the police?

633
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,180
- No.
- We gotta... Maybe he's not...

634
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,790
No, no. No. I... I...

635
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,620
Hon, listen to me.

636
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,120
I ran over him.
Hit and run.

637
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,590
And... and then you stabbed him
with a gardening tool.

638
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,020
The cops... do you think
they're gonna believe us?

639
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,390
I don't know.

640
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,730
But... but people are gonna
look for him.

641
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,420
But... but look. Look.

642
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,790
I-I was careful.

643
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,560
I-I drove the back way
all the way home.

644
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,230
You drove the...

645
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,280
Hon, a-a man's dead.

646
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,010
Well, that's why
we have to clean it up and...

647
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,540
and tell people
I hit a deer or...

648
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,740
We could run.

649
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,510
What?

650
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,550
Go to California.

651
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,290
Calif...

652
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,720
No.

653
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,600
We have a life here, hon.

654
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,800
A family.
I'm gonna buy the shop.

655
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,890
- Okay, then. - Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

656
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,760
And we're gonna start
a f-family.

657
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,260
Well, start again,
I'm saying.

658
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,930
I don't want to.

659
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,300
Okay, then...

660
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,470
You...

661
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,650
Then, hon, look at me.

662
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,050
If we're gonna
get clear of this,

663
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,440
then we're gonna have to
clean it up.

664
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,950
Pretend it didn't happen.

665
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,960
'Cause if this comes out,
if this...

666
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,560
then all the things
you want,

667
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,990
that <i>we</i> want...
that's over.

668
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,040
I go to jail
and maybe you also.

669
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,210
And then there's no shop
and no family.

670
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,640
No kids.

671
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,480
Okay.

672
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,660
Okay, then.
We...

673
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,830
we clean it up.

674
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,160
We clean it up.

675
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,220
Well, should we call that
Saturday?

676
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,310
I suppose we better.

677
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,480
She'll be up at 5:00 anyway
wanting to play dolls.

678
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,490
And I know how fond you are
of your doll-playing time.

679
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,070
Good night,
Mr. Solverson.

680
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,280
Good night, Mrs. Solverson,
and all the ships at sea.

681
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,410
O-Otto?

682
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,180
Otto! No!

683
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,450
No!

684
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,800
Oh! Otto!

685
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,690
Live!

686
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,800
Get the doctor! Go now!

687
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,900
Now!

688
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,060
Otto.
Call the doctor. Go!

689
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,950
_

690
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,720
So, as you see
on page 16 of the prospectus,

691
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,120
the main component of our
Northern expansion strategy

692
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,200
involves the absorption of
the Gerhardt Family Syndicate,

693
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,370
headquartered in Fargo, ND.

694
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,200
Now, the Gerhardts control
trucking and distribution

695
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,680
for the entire Northern Midwest.

696
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,510
It's a family business
started in 1931

697
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,510
by Dieter Gerhardt...

698
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,820
...now deceased,

699
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,120
and taken over in 1950
by his son Otto.

700
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,610
Now, not in the report

701
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,920
but of relevance
to this meeting,

702
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,890
Old Otto had a stroke yesterday

703
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,520
in the family compound
in North Dakota.

704
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,060
Leaving who in charge?

705
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,800
Unclear.

706
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:33,300
His wife, Floyd, she's tough,
but, you know, a girl.

707
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,080
And then there are the three
sons... Dodd, Bear, and Rye.

708
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,480
And of course they all want
their shot at the throne,

709
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,480
which the boys in Research
think provides

710
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,580
a tactical opportunity for us
to move aggressively

711
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,630
to acquire or absorb
their operation.

712
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,590
And if you can't

713
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,400
and the current
business owners resist?

714
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,730
We liquidate.

715
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,580
Approved.

716
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,020
♪ go to sleep, you little babe ♪

717
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,090
