1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:02,141
Erstwhile on<i> Fargo...</i>

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,276
The blackmail...
I'm gonna pay it.

3
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:07,780
Blood and locust?
It's the book of Exodus.

4
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:09,281
God is watching, and He knows.

5
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:10,482
Knows what?

6
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:13,652
Pick me up in an hour.
We'll get the money.

7
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:15,888
He's gonna pay
a million dollars?

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,457
Did you mean
to lock me in here?

9
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:20,259
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

10
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:21,961
That's Sam Hess.

11
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:23,329
You think this could be, like,
an organized crime thing?

12
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,697
We're from Fargo.

13
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,665
You're gonna find him, right?
The guy who did it.

14
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,634
I need a name.

15
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:29,668
Malvo! Malvo!

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,070
Lorne Malvo?

17
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,372
He killed him.
He killed Hess.

18
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:57,256
<i>So anyway, this freakin' guy...</i>

19
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,292
The women are in the box.
Eh?

20
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,494
<i>Custom seal on.</i>

21
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,764
<i>And he decides... Oy!</i>

22
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,501
Soy sauce and another mai tai.

23
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:12,004
Mai tai?
Mai tai!

24
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:18,077
Anyhoo, he decides
he's in love with one of them.

25
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,545
Yield so far 9,000 unique
credit card numbers...

26
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:20,879
<i>This big Russian girl...</i>

27
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,782
with a credit limit
of approximately 1.1 million...

28
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:26,285
minus real estate,
minus labor, minus R&D.

29
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:27,986
<i>After the ship has sailed,</i>
<i>he goes...</i>

30
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:29,321
Sam Hess.

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,762
Assets deployed,
Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers.

32
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:40,232
Three days, plus lodging
plus mileage.

33
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,842
You want the, uh...

34
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:52,244
Bottom line,
they don't think... our guys...

35
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:55,714
they said, doesn't look
related to the business.

36
00:02:55,716 --> 00:03:00,219
Could be extramarital
on the wife's side.

37
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,056
So, uh, now, they're en route
to a second location

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:08,293
to apprehend who we,
uh, think is responsible.

39
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:10,929
Dead.

40
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,199
What's that?

41
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:17,035
Not apprehend.
Dead.

42
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:20,772
Don't care extramarital.
Don't care not related.

43
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,341
Kill and be killed.

44
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:26,645
Head in a bag.
There's the message.

45
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:30,415
<i>Of course, boss. Yeah.</i>

46
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,785
<i>1,900 units shipped
by rail at a cost of 600 per,</i>

47
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:36,622
plus customs, plus
extra-governmental expenses.

48
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,692
<i>Good evening, ladies.
Good eve...</i>

49
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,199
Welcome, ladies,
to Turkish Delight.

50
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,701
To Turkish Delight...

51
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:52,070
where your wish...

52
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:56,875
your<i> wish</i> is our command.

53
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:07,419
Time to make the call.

54
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,422
No.
I mean, you know...

55
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,157
maybe I don't wanna know,
you know?

56
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,927
'Cause maybe something
got broken there in the night,

57
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,429
you know, something important,
like trust.

58
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,231
You know, maybe, uh,

59
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,901
we need to revisit
who gets how much here.

60
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,470
What's in the bags?

61
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,206
Look, okay,
here's what I'm thinking.

62
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,674
I'm thinking 60/40, right?

63
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:30,676
You know, with me getting, uh...
you know, because, you know,

64
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:33,111
am I or am I not doing
all the, uh...

65
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:37,449
What about the...
the voice thingy there?

66
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,888
Luke, I am your father.

67
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,556
Ow.

68
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:45,824
Stop screwing around.

69
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,559
Wha...

70
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,898
Luke...
I think you broke it.

71
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:59,137
So about
that 60/40 split there...

72
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,639
you know, I...

73
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,275
Hey, why is there paper
on the windows?

74
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,680
Word for word.

75
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:14,786
You really want me
to say all this?

76
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,739
Yeah?

77
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,508
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

78
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,276
<i>there was a little boy.</i>

79
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:14,613
He was born in a field
and raised in the woods.

80
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,114
And he had nothing.

81
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,617
<i>In the winter</i>
<i>the boy would freeze,</i>

82
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,219
<i>and in the summer</i>
<i>he would boil.</i>

83
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:24,289
<i>He knew the name</i>
<i>of every stinging insect.</i>

84
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,025
<i>At night he would look</i>
<i>at the lights in the houses,</i>

85
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,227
<i>and he would want.</i>

86
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,432
<i>Why was he outside and they in?</i>

87
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,601
<i>Why was he so hungry</i>
<i>and they fed?</i>

88
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:39,104
<i>"It should be me," he said.</i>

89
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,007
<i>And out of the darkness</i>
<i>the wolves came,</i>

90
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,444
<i>whispering.</i>

91
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,646
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>what I'm saying?</i>

92
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:53,452
Yeah.

93
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,288
<i>Gustafson parking
garage, high noon.</i>

94
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:16,375
Well, did it sound
like he's gonna pay?

95
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:18,877
I... I don't know
what that sounds like.

96
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,682
So is the Greek the boy or...

97
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,952
Give me that duffel over there,
and I'll tell you.

98
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:33,825
Hey, uh...

99
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,128
what's with all the duct tape?

100
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,148
<i>I'm telling you, folks,</i>

101
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,550
<i>things are shaping up</i>
<i>to make this</i>

102
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:48,218
<i>one of the worst blizzards</i>
<i>in Minnesota history,</i>

103
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,287
<i>the perfect storm</i>
<i>or what have you.</i>

104
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,222
<i>This is definitely one</i>
<i>for the record books.</i>

105
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,724
<i>That's right, Norm.</i>

106
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:55,892
<i>And expect whiteouts</i>
<i>and blizzard-like conditions.</i>

107
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:58,929
<i>And since it's to move slightly</i>
<i>down from Canada,</i>

108
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,865
<i>also expect poor road</i>
<i>conditions and even closures.</i>

109
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,334
<i>So, folks,</i>
<i>please avoid driving today</i>

110
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:06,136
<i>unless you absolutely have to.</i>

111
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,304
<i>Gosh, avoid going out...</i>

112
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:26,289
Starting to come down out there.

113
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,792
<i>Storm of the century,</i>
<i>they're saying.</i>

114
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,627
Is Greta here?

115
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,896
No, she's at a friend's.

116
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,565
Thought it would be safer.

117
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,935
Um, you didn't have to come.

118
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,237
I was coming anyway.
Told you last night.

119
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,440
Just left a little earlier is all.

120
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,909
So, um, you really think
this Malvo fella

121
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,510
was at your apartment?

122
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,012
<i>Not at the apartment, outside.</i>

123
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,314
<i>Uh, my neighbor,</i>
<i>he does the watch.</i>

124
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:53,416
Said he saw this fella
sitting in his car

125
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,918
outside the apartment.

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,088
May even have followed me here,
I'm thinking.

127
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,823
So the neighbor...
Jewish fella...

128
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,658
he gives the guy a warning,
you know,

129
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,326
a kinda "move along."

130
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,229
Said the fella
was real menacing in return.

131
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,465
Had a police scanner, he said.

132
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,468
<i>Talked about how maybe</i>
<i>he was gonna</i>

133
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,837
come back and kill
the neighbor and his family.

134
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,804
<i>Aw, jeez.</i>

135
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:17,107
Did you call it in?

136
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,943
Well, see,

137
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:22,412
I don't think they'd believe me
is the thing.

138
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:25,215
I mean, not after, you know,
I arrest the wrong fella,

139
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,683
being what they think.

140
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,284
<i>So there's that.</i>

141
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,120
He get a plate number,
your neighbor?

142
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,321
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

143
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:33,857
He, uh...
I called it in.

144
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,060
SUV of some type, company car.

145
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,695
<i>Which company?</i>

146
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:41,131
The grocery chain, you know.
July in January.

147
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,566
- Phoenix Farms.
<i>- Right.</i>

148
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,968
<i>Which...</i>

149
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,739
This Malvo fella's
saying he's a pastor,

150
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,909
so I'm not sure
of the connection there.

151
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,911
Well, maybe we should
drive over,

152
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,312
see what they say.

153
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,848
Yeah.
Let me get changed.

154
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,638
Morning, Mr. Creech.

155
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,341
And how are we feeling there,
Mr. Nygaard?

156
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,643
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

157
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:29,312
Real good.
Ready to go home.

158
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:32,415
Well, now, that's up to him,
I suppose.

159
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,853
So how's your pain level
on a scale of one to ten?

160
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:39,289
Uh, yeah, not bad.

161
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,723
So maybe a three?

162
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,726
Hmm?

163
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,095
Wh-what's with, uh...

164
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,531
Why is there
a police officer outside?

165
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,667
Not for me to say, is it?

166
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:57,207
Okay, Mr. Creech,

167
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,943
I'll be back to take you
to radiology in ten minutes.

168
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:21,965
<i>I'm his brother, Chazz.</i>

169
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,867
<i>Chazz Nygaard.</i>

170
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,849
Lester, it's me.

171
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:42,752
Hey.

172
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:46,155
What did you do?

173
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,857
- When?
- Come on, Lester.

174
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,426
There's a deputy outside
the door, for Pete's sake.

175
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,862
I just... ah...

176
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:56,466
cut my hand on a...
some rusty nail.

177
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,402
Not sure how that involves
local law enforcement.

178
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,764
They said you were there when
the police chief got murdered.

179
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:04,841
Well, heck.

180
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:08,511
I think I'd remember that.

181
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>Unless...</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

182
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:13,449
with the head injury maybe...

183
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,619
- 'Cause things...
<i>- You're lying.</i>

184
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:17,921
S-says who?

185
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:20,290
That cop, the female,
says you're a suspect.

186
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>- Suspect of what?</i>
- Murder.

187
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:25,395
For... for Pearl, the Chief.
Even Sam Hess.

188
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,730
That is crazy is what that is.

189
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,866
I'm the victim!
Me!

190
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:33,603
He came to my house.
They!

191
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,171
I almost died.
Did you tell her that?

192
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't lie to me!

193
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,778
I took you in m...
my house...

194
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,013
- This is...
- ...around my kid.

195
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,214
Oh, boy.

196
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,716
Oh, boy.
Classic.

197
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:48,217
Cops can't figure out
who did it,

198
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,752
so they start
throwing blame around.

199
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,087
You said you were kidnapped.

200
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,422
You call me in a meeting,

201
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,257
said you were mixed up
in something.

202
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,959
That was... I told you
I was just pranking you.

203
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,460
No, you said you were
in the trunk of a car,

204
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,862
said a couple fellas
grabbed you.

205
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,130
What are you mixed up in,
Lester?

206
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,498
What the heck is going on?

207
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,434
Chazz, I swear to you,
this is all

208
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,903
just a...

209
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:10,139
Heck, you're my brother.
You should be on my side.

210
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,211
People are dead, Lester.

211
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,814
Your own wife.

212
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:21,184
A... a conspiracy,
they're saying, like, like,

213
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:24,721
like maybe you hired a fella
to... to...

214
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,192
To?

215
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:30,493
What?

216
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,362
Come on.

217
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,600
Chazz, I swear to God.
I did not do this.

218
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,969
Anything.

219
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:42,505
Well, they think you did
or know who did, so...

220
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:44,774
so you gotta
give 'em something.

221
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,242
Someone.

222
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,978
If you want this to go away,
you gotta give them someone.

223
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,985
Chazz...

224
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:59,722
buddy, come on.
This is...

225
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,392
You have gotta
stand by me here.

226
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:05,528
<i>You've been a burden</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

227
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,331
I'm done.

228
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,866
There's something wrong
with you, Lester.

229
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,634
There's...
there's something missing.

230
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,940
<i>You're not right in the world.</i>

231
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,444
Chazz.

232
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,580
Chazz.

233
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,970
<i>Here's Mr. Creech's chart.</i>

234
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:30,740
<i>Can you take that</i>
<i>when you see him?</i>

235
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:34,577
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

236
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,415
Are we ready, Mr. Creech?

237
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,496
Okay, Mr. Creech.

238
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,565
Someone will be out for you
in a minute.

239
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:58,466
So he had a shotgun pellet
in his hand this whole time?

240
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:01,769
Lester?
Yeah.

241
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,137
Which means he wasn't
knocked out in the basement

242
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,406
like he said he was.

243
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,475
So maybe...

244
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:11,312
maybe he and Malvo
weren't foes there at the end.

245
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:15,783
Maybe they colluded
on this whole thing.

246
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,318
Hmm.

247
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:23,424
Welcome to Phoenix Farms.

248
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,892
Hiya.
We're police officers.

249
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,260
You sure are.

250
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,195
- This about the bugs?
- Sorry?

251
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:29,730
The bugs.
The... What do you...

252
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,199
Locust?
Er... wait.

253
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,402
Maybe we're not
supposed to tell people.

254
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:37,071
Dave, are we telling people
about the bugs?

255
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:40,841
Is there a manager
or someone we can talk to?

256
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,209
Not sure anybody's in yet.

257
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,744
Dave, anybody
in the offices yet?

258
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:47,014
Let me check.

259
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,816
Mr. Cosmopolis
to Customer Service.

260
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,785
Mr. Cosmopolis
to Customer Service.

261
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,172
Okay, then.

262
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:14,508
Uh, I'm gonna leave my card.
Deputy Solverson.

263
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,345
We're here about a company car,
who's driving it.

264
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,246
The license number
there on the back.

265
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,248
Uh, when a manager gets in,
just have him call.

266
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,616
- Okay, sure.
- Thanks.

267
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,952
Thanks for stopping by!

268
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,520
So what do we do now then?

269
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,990
I could use
another cup of coffee.

270
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:09,630
Oh, God.

271
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, my God.

272
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,902
Oh, God.

273
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,550
What?

274
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:33,721
<i>Kid's getting restless.</i>

275
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:35,423
<i>How's he doing?</i>

276
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:38,259
He's baffled, just like me.

277
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,027
Did you make the drop?

278
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,129
No.

279
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,732
<i>It's not too
late to get off the pot.</i>

280
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,167
<i>It's a lot of damn money.</i>

281
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:48,102
It's not about the money.

282
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,970
It's bigger than the...

283
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:52,807
Thank you, God.

284
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,279
<i>Than what?</i>

285
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:00,514
I know what I gotta do now.

286
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:04,084
Give me an hour and head back.

287
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,954
Tell the damn kid

288
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,689
I love him.

289
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:11,592
<i>Yeah, I'm, uh,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna say that.</i>

290
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:20,301
Pack your shit!
We're heading home.

291
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:23,671
Was that my dad?

292
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:30,177
Ticket, please.

293
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,214
I changed my mind.

294
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,648
<i>I decided...</i>

295
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,551
God. He told me.

296
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:41,288
He has different plans.

297
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,123
God told you not to park here?

298
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,326
No, no, no.

299
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,995
I know what I have to do now.
I didn't before.

300
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,697
Well, sir, I gotta...

301
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:53,033
It's $2
for the first 30 minutes, so...

302
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:54,502
- Son, you go to church?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

303
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:57,071
Then open the goddamn gate.
Your Lord demands it.

304
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,751
Two-faced.

305
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,986
What's that?

306
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:13,454
Oh.

307
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,890
When someone's a liar,
that's what you...

308
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:19,960
you say.
He's two-faced.

309
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,196
Like, he's got one face
for telling the truth

310
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:25,633
and another for...

311
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:30,237
I guess that's what bothers me
the most, you know?

312
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,773
Not the violence
and the murders and all?

313
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:35,676
Well, of course that.

314
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,846
I mean...

315
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,347
When a dog goes rabid, right,

316
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:45,185
there's no mistaking it
for a normal dog.

317
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:47,288
Here we are,
we're supposed to be...

318
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,959
you know, us people,
we're supposed to know better.

319
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:55,062
To be better, you know?

320
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:03,604
Must be hard to live in
this world if you believe that.

321
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,240
You have no idea.

322
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:11,645
<i>620, be aware.
Possible 313 in progress.</i>

323
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:13,147
<i>Bishop and Main.</i>

324
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:25,426
<i>8434 base, I'm gonna
go ahead and cancel this thing.</i>

325
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:46,246
I thought about it.

326
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,148
The 60/40 thing
doesn't work for me.

327
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:14,508
Hey! Hey!

328
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:35,329
In case, uh,
Stavros does call the cops,

329
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,698
we wanna make sure
they're too busy to respond.

330
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,699
That's part one.

331
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:41,068
Mm?

332
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,538
Mm.
Mm-mm.

333
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:08,896
Part two is...

334
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:11,231
have you ever
had Turkish Delight?

335
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,901
It's disgusting.

336
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,377
That's okay.

337
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:25,479
I'd be insulted
if you didn't try.

338
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:27,347
<i>Roger that.</i>

339
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,549
<i>One citation.</i>

340
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:33,987
<i>10-4. We are

341
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:37,458

00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,091
<i>All units, be aware,

345
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,496
Ow.
Jeez.

346
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:07,427
_

347
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,765
Mr. Creech?

348
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:02,028
Hello?

349
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,964
Anyone there?

350
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:42,622
<i>No TV till you
do your homework.</i>

351
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:45,825
Don't go there.
You know that.

352
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,700
<i>Wash your hands first.</i>

353
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:56,436
- I did. - Yeah? When,
between the car and the house?

354
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:37,977
So this fella gives away
all his money and a kidney,

355
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,646
and then he kills himself?

356
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:42,615
<i>That's what he said.
My neighbor.</i>

357
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,986
Why didn't the fella
just go work for a charity?

358
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:48,922
Got me.

359
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:54,794
Probably close the roads soon,
if you're gonna head back.

360
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:56,629
Still gotta take a look
at Lester's car.

361
00:33:56,631 --> 00:34:00,300
Maybe take another run
at Phoenix Farms, I'm thinking.

362
00:34:00,302 --> 00:34:04,137
Try to get an ID
on that company car.

363
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,973
Don't much like this fella
threatening people.

364
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:15,748
Never wanted to be a cop,
you know?

365
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,883
I mean...

366
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:20,987
Some kids grow up
thinking about it, but not me.

367
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,257
And your dream was what then?

368
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:26,793
You're gonna think
it's funny, but...

369
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:29,462
I always wanted to work
for the post office

370
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,632
<i>and be a mailman.</i>

371
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,403
I like that you get to see
the same people every day.

372
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:40,540
Bring 'em that check
they've been waiting for.

373
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,610
Presents for Christmas.

374
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:47,547
You know,
be part of the community.

375
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:49,849
But when I applied,

376
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:52,385
they were on a hiring freeze.

377
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:53,920
Then this pal from high school

378
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:57,423
tells me the local PD's hiring,
so took the bus downtown.

379
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,460
Never thought they'd, you know...
they'd take me.

380
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:03,997
So why try?

381
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:07,500
Well, you know, uh...

382
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,868
Greta's mom passed,

383
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,372
and she was the one
with the paycheck, so...

384
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,081
Oh, jeez.

385
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,018
I wonder what that's about.

386
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:47,507
How bad?

387
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:50,977
Sir, multiple shots fired,
property damage.

388
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:53,313
No injury reports at this time.

389
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:55,682
And perps are still thought
to be inside.

390
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:57,250
Multiple?

391
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:59,185
Unclear at this time.

392
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:07,160
To the individual
or individuals inside the house,

393
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:10,597
this is Lieutenant Schmidt,
Duluth Police Department.

394
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,167
<i>I'm ordering you</i>
<i>to throw out your weapon</i>

395
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:16,769
<i>and come out</i>
<i>with your hands up,</i>

396
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:18,705
<i>or we start blasting.</i>

397
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,415
Move.

398
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,818
<i>Roger that.</i>

399
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,953
<i>Tag Team is on the move,</i>
<i>on the move.</i>

400
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:35,622
<i>Divide and conquer on three.</i>

401
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:38,057
<i>Divide and conquer on three.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

402
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:43,796
<i>Fire!</i>

403
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,965
<i>Stay down!</i>
<i>Take cover!</i>

404
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:49,102
They're shooting!
Shots fired, shots fired.

405
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,270
<i>Engage. Engage.</i>

406
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:17,397
<i>Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

407
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,832
<i>Cease fire!</i>

408
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,501
Cease fire, damn it!

409
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,278
I think we got him.

410
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,480
Based on what, ESP?

411
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:35,782
Breach.

412
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,283
<i>Breach!</i>

413
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,910
Wait!

414
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,390
Gun!

415
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,425
<i>Suspect is down.
Repeat, suspect is down.</i>

416
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,660
<i>Oddest suicide by cop I ever...</i>

417
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,988
They're shooting up the block.
It's goddamn World War III.

418
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,590
Call 911.

419
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:10,796
No, wait!

420
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,165
This is Grimly.
Shots fired, Fourth and Hunter.

421
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,867
Requesting backup.

422
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,980
What do you think?

423
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:12,618
Uh, accident, I guess.
Words exchanged, differences?

424
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,920
Heck of a lot of bullets
for a fender bender.

425
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:36,208
No, wait!
We should wait for...

426
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:38,744
Who?

427
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:45,985
- Who?
- God!

428
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:47,453
Damn it!

429
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:49,021
Fargo!

430
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:50,990
It was Fargo!

431
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,012
<i>Here!</i>

432
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:23,489
One down!

433
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:36,035
He's dead, I think!

434
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:03,729
<i>Freeze! Police officer!</i>

435
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,204
Halt!

436
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:12,189
<i>Just a horrible
time to be on the roads, guys,</i>

437
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:14,558
<i>and I don't recall</i>
<i>any time, Kim,</i>

438
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,094
<i>unless you get</i>
<i>a serious blizzard like '96</i>

439
00:45:17,096 --> 00:45:18,996
<i>or even into '93,</i>

440
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:21,865
<i>where we had</i>
<i>so many interstates shut down.</i>

441
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,369
Let there be light, huh?

442
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:46,243
What the heck was that?

443
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:47,944
What?

444
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:49,880
Jeez, God! Fish!

445
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:51,915
Jeez!

446
00:48:57,782 --> 00:49:00,050
Buddy?

447
00:49:03,855 --> 00:49:06,489
Buddy?

448
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,858
Dmitri?

449
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:24,207
Oh, buddy.
Oh, buddy.

450
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:26,142
I gave it back.

451
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:31,147
I gave it back.

452
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:47,163
Mr. Creech.

453
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,769
Mr. Creech.

454
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,242
Oh, thank gosh.

455
00:49:59,244 --> 00:50:00,810
<i>There you are,</i>
<i>Mr. Creech.</i>

456
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:02,379
Mm.

457
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,314
Thought we'd lost you.
