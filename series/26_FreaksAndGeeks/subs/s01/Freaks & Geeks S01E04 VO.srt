Freaks and Geeks S01E04 Kim Kelly Is My Friend (VO)

1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,722
Hey, those are for my French class.

2
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:17,597
Oh, but I love sprinkles.

3
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,265
- Fine. Just eat it.
- Hey, I'm really hungry, too.

4
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:22,690
Please.

5
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,515
- Just take the plain, OK?
- Oh, thank you.

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,322
People are walking here, OK? God!

7
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,522
Now they're dirty,

8
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:34,997
so just eat them.

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,233
- Here.
- Thanks.

10
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:46,420
- What? What's your problem?
- My problem is your face, dirtbag.

11
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:50,248
What's going on with her?

12
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,523
Ricky dumped her this morning.
She's on the warpath.

13
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,254
Well, if she's looking
for new customers,

14
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,079
I'm up for a test drive.

15
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,681
Shut up, Daniel.

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,761
Karen, wait up!

17
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,074
Jeez, Perry, you're looking huge.

18
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,949
Yeah? Well, I been
workin' out after school.

19
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:13,044
Sorry, little guy. I didn't see ya.
You all right, pal?

20
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,532
All right.

21
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,171
- You OK?
- I can't breathe.

22
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,869
That guy hit you
in the solar plexus.

23
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,208
Fellas...

24
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,379
My brother sent me
this amazing chem set.

25
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,292
I propose after school

26
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,009
we make some acid, pour it on
the sidewalk, and watch it kill bugs.

27
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,227
What are you doing?
That's my locker.

28
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:42,977
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:45,837
I didn't know.
I thought it was mine.

30
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:47,362
See? This is mine.

31
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:50,672
I just got hit in the solar plexus,
so I'm a little out of it.

32
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,812
I don't wanna hear
your life story, OK?

33
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:54,363
I want you to move your ass!

34
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:02,124
Hey, Karen, was this guy trying
to break into your locker?

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,043
No! No. I was just confused.
You know, I thought it was my locker.

36
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,844
Yeah. You are
very confused, pee-wee.

37
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,006
Are you sure you're
even in the right school?

38
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:14,383
- How old are you?
- 14.

39
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,268
You can't be 14, midget.

40
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,677
You haven't even hit puberty.

41
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:24,433
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.

42
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,355
You don't even have hair
in your pits.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,230
Come on, Karen. Let's go.

44
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,899
You swear you're 14?

45
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:32,488
Then you're a geek.

46
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,327
This is your locker?

47
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,914
There. Now you'll always know
which one's yours

48
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,681
and which one's mine.

49
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:47,806
OK, geek?

50
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,566
You don't have hair in your pits?

52
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,816
So why did Ricky
break up with Karen?

53
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,492
Is she, like, a prude?

54
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,944
Did she not, you know...

55
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:07,569
Go the distance?

56
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:09,955
Distance?

57
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,213
No, she's not a prude.

58
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,351
She's a slut, obviously.

59
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,047
Obviously.

60
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,423
She's a friend of yours.

61
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,303
Last week, she started getting it on
with Ricky's older brother.

62
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:23,928
Oh, cool.

63
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:25,973
Yesterday...

64
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,225
He walked in on them.

65
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,354
Who walked in on who?

66
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,940
"Who walked in on who?"

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,280
God, people are so gossipy
at this school.

68
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,998
It's, like, get a life, you know?

69
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,247
What's up with her?

70
00:04:57,901 --> 00:04:59,993
That's Gary Ross' seat.

71
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,261
But he's sick.
He has impetigo.

72
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:15,898
What? Are you gonna
sit over here now?

73
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,892
I just don't feel like
being abused today.

74
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:22,318
I mean, I give up, you know?
I go out of my way to be nice to her,

75
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:23,743
and it's like...

76
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:26,347
No matter what I do, you know?

77
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:30,941
Are you OK?

78
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,793
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to Kim right now.

79
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,420
No. No, no, no. Don't.

80
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,260
Yeah, I am becau...

81
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:43,884
It... Lindsay, it's really
cool when you hang out,

82
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,749
and she shouldn't ruin
everything for everybody

83
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,132
just because she's always
on her period, you know?

84
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,634
No, Nick, it's OK.

85
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,059
No, it's not OK.

86
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,122
It's... you know, it's not OK.
That's the thing.

87
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,901
Just... please don't.
Don't say anything to her.

88
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,613
Promise me you won't.

89
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:08,606
Yeah. All right. OK.
Whatever you want.

90
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Thanks.

91
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,457
A defaced locker...
A humiliated freshman...

92
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,960
And a busty succubus from hell...

93
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,276
Perhaps we've left McKinley High

94
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,436
and entered the chilling
corridors of the Twilight Zone.

95
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,911
You're not funny.

96
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,969
I can't believe
she inspected your pits.

97
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:32,790
You know, I thought she was
gonna make sweet love to ya.

98
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:42,283
What am I supposed to do?
I mean, fight her?

99
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:43,558
She's a girl.

100
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,288
My dad has a rule:
you don't fight girls.

101
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,968
My dad has a rule:
you don't piss your pants at school.

102
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,993
Hey, I didn't piss my pants!

103
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,873
Hey! What happened to my artwork?!

104
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:58,173
I spent a lot of time on that!

105
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:00,461
I washed it off.

106
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,047
Well, how you gonna remember
where your locker is?

107
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:05,132
I'll remember.

108
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:06,801
No, you won't.

109
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:08,762
Listen...

110
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,431
I don't wanna have to fight you.

111
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,088
You wanna fight me, huh?

112
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:16,143
You wanna mix it up a little bit?

113
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,023
What was that, Bilbo Baggins?

114
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:23,797
I... I didn't say anything.
It was him.

115
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,286
Are you guys deformed or something?
I mean, what's the deal?

116
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,902
Look, I guess I'm just gonna
have to mark that locker again.

117
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:34,362
This time...
In geek blood.

118
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,081
Well, I'd better get to class.

119
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,938
I hope she meant your geek blood.

120
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,830
What are you doing?

121
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:58,626
Kim wants me to wait for her.
She's on the phone with her mom.

122
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,301
I said, I don't know.
Are you deaf?!

123
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,131
No. I'll try, OK? I'll try.

124
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:05,256
I'll try!

125
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:09,045
God, would you quit yelling at me,
you psychopath?!

126
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,589
You know, sometimes
relationships can be a drag.

127
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:14,264
Especially if you're
goin' out with her.

128
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:15,837
Sorry.

129
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,474
No. I know.

130
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,134
She can be cool
if you get to know her.

131
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,337
You know, mother,
you have really lost it this time!

132
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,571
No... well, you need help!

133
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:27,996
God!

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Well, as usual, my mother
is being a total shrew.

135
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,562
Oh, biology.

136
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:37,233
I think I have a test,
so I'll see you guys later.

137
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,358
See ya.

138
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,807
So, how's it goin'?

139
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,401
What?

140
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,803
I said, how's it goin'?

141
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,273
Fine...

142
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:52,704
I guess.

143
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,397
Well, what are you doin' later?

144
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,700
I don't know.

145
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:00,550
Well, meet me after school, OK?

146
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,313
We can hang.

147
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:04,215
OK.

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,581
I heard about what she does
in the yearbook darkroom.

149
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:17,906
What she does?

150
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,018
What?

151
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,521
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

152
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,648
She does it.

153
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:27,775
What do you mean, "it"?

154
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:29,802
She...

155
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,405
Fornicates it. OK?

156
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,128
I doubt it.

157
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,534
And so what if she does?

158
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:38,706
I just think it's sad.

159
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,331
We can't all be girl scouts, Millie.

160
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:46,323
And I expect legible handwriting!

161
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:49,103
I can't spend my time trying to
decipher your chicken scrawl.

162
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:50,604
That's not my job.

163
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:52,666
- You gotta come see this.
- What is it?

164
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,841
Hurry, man.

165
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,599
What's a pygmy?

166
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,602
It's a dwarf from Australia.
It's just a nickname.

167
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,965
Hey, look, if you don't
get rid of that,

168
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,532
you're gonna be called
pygmy geek for the next 4 years.

169
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:10,735
Jeez!

170
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
Weir!

171
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:20,081
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

172
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,503
Oh, grow up!

173
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:25,370
- Someone wrote on my locker.
- So this is your locker?

174
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:29,493
No. This is the school's locker.
That's gonna have to be repainted, bub.

175
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,886
- It wasn't me.
- This wasn't you?

176
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,201
Well, yeah, but...

177
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,400
You kids don't respect
school property.

178
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,525
I mean, you just don't get it.

179
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,515
OK, I want you to write an essay

180
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,101
by tomorrow, 500 words...

181
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,688
"Why vandalism...
Why the property of school

182
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,906
should be respected
and why we should respect it,"

183
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,363
and I want it tomorrow, or you're
gonna be on trash detail for a week.{\, you got me?}

184
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,465
Yeah. Laugh it up.

185
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:11,510
Where you goin'?

186
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:13,957
I dunno. Home.

187
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,300
Well, what are you doing later?

188
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:17,815
What?

189
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,788
Do you want to come over
to my house for dinner?

190
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:27,353
Did Nick say something to you?

191
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,813
What do you mean?

192
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,106
Did Nick tell you to be nice to me?

193
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,814
Well... yeah.

194
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:38,312
I just figured since we have to see
each other anyways all the time,

195
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:40,587
we may as well try to get along.

196
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,159
So do you wanna come over
to my house or not?

197
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:45,454
I don't know.

198
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,791
You know what?
Fine. Just forget it.

199
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,674
You know, I tried.

200
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,799
Kim!

201
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:56,854
Yeah, what?

202
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,635
I'll have dinner at your house.

203
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,309
All right.

204
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,172
My parents are jerks.

205
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:08,487
They love to kill my buzz,
but afterwards we can ditch 'em,

206
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:10,438
and go catch a movie or something?

207
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,212
All right. I'll pick you up
at your house at 5:30.

208
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,656
I'll see you at 5:30!

209
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah. Later.

210
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,521
Hey, honey.

211
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:35,713
How was school?

212
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,671
I don't wanna talk about it, OK?

213
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:38,946
Oh, OK, then.

214
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,676
Samuel, you are going
to ruin your dinner.

215
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,178
I'm loading up on carbs.

216
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,311
But we're having carbs for dinner.

217
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,893
You want me to stay a midget?
Is that what you want?

218
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,061
You are not a midget.

219
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,655
Yeah, I am, and it's because
there's no food in this house.

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,282
- I'm malnourished.
- No food?

221
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,357
What's all this?

222
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,519
Fruit roll-ups, beef jerky.

223
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,642
You're just...

224
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,271
You're just finicky.

225
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,537
Mom, is it OK if I skip out
on dinner tonight?

226
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,164
What? Why?

227
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,782
Well, I was invited over
to Kim Kelly's.

228
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,278
- Who's Kim Kelly?
- She's just a friend.

229
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,747
Oh, new friend?
What's she like?

230
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,466
I don't know.
She's just a girl.

231
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,721
Kim Kelly's a psycho.

232
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,374
She and Karen Scarfoli?

233
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,022
They're violent. They run around
the school being evil.

234
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,783
That doesn't sound very nice.

235
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,214
Why do you want to be friends
with a girl like that?

236
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,069
She's not evil, mom.
She's just different.

237
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,877
She doesn't wear frilly dresses
or prance around like a cheerleader.

238
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:49,078
Just 'cause a girl speaks her mind
doesn't mean she's a psycho.

239
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,753
You should have told me yesterday.
I'm making veal piccata.

240
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:54,555
Maybe another night.

241
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,162
Mom, she's coming to
pick me up in 15 minutes.

242
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:59,187
Fine.
Eat with your friend.

243
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,754
Why are you friends with Kim Kelly?

244
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:12,964
Don't talk to me, OK?

245
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,727
Kim Kelly's my enemy.

246
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:19,066
If you're gonna start being a tattletale
and trying to get me into trouble,

247
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,648
then maybe you should go
to a different high school.

248
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:25,036
I don't need some spy
reporting on my every move.

249
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:29,222
I just don't know why you
have to hang out with her.

250
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,225
Well, why not?

251
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,247
Because she and her friends
are mean to me.

252
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,908
They wrote "geek" on my locker.

253
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,933
Well, maybe you are a geek.

254
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,350
I'm just kidding.

255
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,976
Oh, come on, Sam, like I meant that.

256
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,643
Hey, move it or lose it.

257
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,965
Oh, man!
I got the worst cramps.

258
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,628
I just about died
on the way over here.

259
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:04,753
Hey, Kim.

260
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,370
Can you do me a favor?

261
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,356
Can you quit picking
on my little brother?

262
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,614
I keep forgetting
he's your little brother.

263
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,751
He looks just like
all those other geeks.

264
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,142
Come on. Let's go.

265
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,106
I hate Lindsay
and her stupid friends.

266
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:28,108
You don't hate your sister.

267
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,480
Yeah, I do. She sucks.

268
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:33,836
Samuel, don't ever use
that disgusting word again.

269
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,239
Sorry.

270
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,533
All right,
I'm warning you right now.

271
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:54,535
My parents are seriously wacko.

272
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,673
Yeah. Mine, too.
Don't worry about it.

273
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,749
No. Mine are mental, OK?

274
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,674
They're looking for
a reason to sell my Gremlin.

275
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,642
- They are?
- God, they're such cheap bastards!

276
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,817
But my aunt Kathy gave me this car,
and it's mine.

277
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,014
My aunt Kathy was so rad.

278
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,506
She lived in LA.
She was on <i>Kojak</i>.

279
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,519
She doinked Ryan O'Neal
once at a party.

280
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,512
Wow! She sounds awesome.

281
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:23,013
Yeah. Well, she's dead.

282
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:24,488
She OD'd on coke.

283
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:29,987
So, you see... There's a lot
riding on this dinner.

284
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,283
I can't lose my car.
You get it?

285
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,820
I don't know if I do.

286
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,519
Roll up my window.

287
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:41,187
I don't want my car to get stolen.

288
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:46,970
My parents hate everybody.

289
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,678
They hate Daniel.
They can't stand Karen.

290
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,469
The only person they like is you.

291
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,055
But I've never even met them.

292
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,464
Yeah. Well, I told them
all about you,

293
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,414
how you're like this
golden girl and everything,

294
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:02,239
how you get good grades.

295
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,912
My mother's going to be
pressing you for information.

296
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,567
Just follow my lead.

297
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,277
Oh, and by the way,

298
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,452
I spend the night
at your house every Friday.

299
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:13,321
Last weekend, we went up to
your vacation house in Benton Harbor

300
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,459
- and went water-skiing.
- We... what?

301
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:18,085
Hi there.
You must be Lindsay.

302
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,499
It's really nice to meet you.

303
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:26,390
Kim, did you pick up any soda?

304
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,202
I forgot.

305
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:35,085
Well, I forgot to make you dinner.
How do you like that?

306
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,260
Come on in.

307
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
So...

308
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,332
Kim says you're a genius.

309
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,319
No, I'm not.
At all.

310
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,867
I get good grades, I guess.

311
00:17:57,316 --> 00:18:00,705
Well, why don't you help out Kim?
She's hangin' on for dear life.

312
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,873
BS. I get good grades.

313
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,544
Oh, I hate to blow your mind, sister,
but Ds are not good. Ds are bad.

314
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,214
I got one "D", OK?

315
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,675
I told you my history teacher
was a pervert.

316
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,377
I wasn't about to go to his house
after school to get "tutored."

317
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,638
Can it, Kim.
You're gonna wake up Chip.

318
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,022
At least I know how to read.

319
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,399
What was that?

320
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,901
Nothing.

321
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,601
So... I hear you girls
had a fun weekend.

322
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,699
Yeah, it was great.

323
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:40,323
We went water-skiing.
I love to water-ski.

324
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:43,289
And, uh, you got a vacation
house up there in Benton Harbor?

325
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,490
That must be nice, huh?

326
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:49,493
- Your family must be very wealthy.
- Hardly.

327
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:51,756
Kim says that you are affluent.

328
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,424
Well, we do all right.

329
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm really not supposed
to talk about it.

330
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:59,263
My dad always says a farmer never
reveals how many cows he's got.

331
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,319
- Your old man's a farmer?
- No. 

332
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,269
He owns A1 Sporting Goods.

333
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,230
Really? Can he get us a discount?

334
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:12,526
What?

335
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,314
We don't live in a mansion here,
as you can see.

336
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:19,057
We don't have a swimming pool
and tennis court, the way you do.

337
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,682
We may not be rich, but we get by.

338
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:25,165
- We're remodeling.
- Oh, and take your time with that.

339
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,240
I love relievin' myself
behind a shower curtain.

340
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,965
Smells like fart.

341
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:38,926
- Here. Hold this test tube.
- Yeah, right.

342
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:41,292
I'm not gonna get
my fingers melted off

343
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,467
just so you can get a kick.

344
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:44,976
OK? I need these fingers.

345
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,104
Why? So you can pick your rumpus?
Just hold the test tube.

346
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:52,280
No. I read in this magazine
about a chemical

347
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:54,953
that burns your flesh.
This kid got a little bit on him

348
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:58,278
and now he's goin' to Disneyland
for his last hoorah.

349
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,899
You guys...
I'm writing an essay.

350
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,787
Could you just, like,
be quiet, please?

351
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,511
- OK?
- All right.

352
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,495
How many words you got?

353
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:12,516
33.

354
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,995
It's so unfair!

355
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,257
I mean, if I have to write an essay,

356
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,928
then Karen Scarfoli should
have to write a big, fat book.

357
00:20:22,174 --> 00:20:23,974
I think she's a sex fiend.

358
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,279
You should move your locker.

359
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,315
What if she comes to school
really horny one day?

360
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,981
- Girls don't get horny.
- They don't?

361
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,983
Only guys get horny.

362
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,193
Maybe Karen Scarfoli's a guy.

363
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:38,821
Sam, if it was me,

364
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,199
I'd go to Karen Scarfoli's house
and make her write it.

365
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,536
- I'm sure you would.
- I would.

366
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,497
You can't let chicks humiliate you
like that in public.

367
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:51,125
She did not humiliate me.

368
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,377
Uh... she kinda did.

369
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:58,779
OK, all right, then what about
when she started picking on you?

370
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,510
You ran away, Bilbo Baggins.

371
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,721
Yeah? Well, at least,
I'm not a pygmy.

372
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:11,228
So, how long you had that house
up there in Benton Harbor, Lindsay?

373
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,023
A few years.

374
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah. You know,
I did waitress up there one summer,

375
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,415
so I know the area pretty good.
Where's your house at?

376
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,719
It's... by the water.

377
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,619
Yeah. What neighborhood?

378
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:30,331
Uh, it's, uh... over by the...

379
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:34,001
Uh, Mom, Lindsay invited me up
this weekend to go fishing.

380
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,504
- Can I go?
- What street is it on?

381
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,340
Benton Harbor...

382
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:44,512
Street.

383
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,559
You are a lying brat!

384
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,199
I knew it!
I told you.

385
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,856
I'm not lying. You just can't
believe I can make a friend

386
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,899
- who's rich and smart.
- She's not smart.

387
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,200
No, she is! She's really smart!
I swear to God, she's smart!

388
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,925
She's a bum, like
all your other friends!

389
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,628
What's happening?

390
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,235
It's that car!
You're driving around town,

391
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,621
you're tramping it up in that car!
I know what you do!

392
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,212
Yeah, you should know!
I learned it from you!

393
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:15,376
You're grounded for good,
you got me?

394
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,920
News flash.
You're not my father, fat ass!

395
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,255
Damn right, I'm not!

396
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,424
Aw, that's it!
We're selling the car!

397
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:25,636
No! That's my car!
Aunt Kathy gave me that car!

398
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,775
Oh, yeah? Well, your aunt Kathy
spent $1,000 of my money

399
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,101
snorting it up her nose, so as far
as I'm concerned, that car is mine!

400
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:34,604
Fine! I'm outta here.

401
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,106
Oh, no, you don't.
No. No!

402
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,456
You are not going out anywhere.

403
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:41,694
- Go to the car, Lindsay!
- Give me those keys!

404
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:46,616
Give me the keys! Get her keys!

405
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,113
Lindsay, go!

406
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:52,950
Give me the keys!

407
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:11,506
Open the door!

408
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,311
Open that door!

409
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,944
- Get inside!
- When I get my hands on you, sister!

410
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:25,976
Get out of that car!

411
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,878
That's my car!
Now get out!

412
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,330
Kim, hurry!

413
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:34,239
If you leave now,
you are never coming back!

414
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,999
Don't you start this car!

415
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,490
You are never coming back here!

416
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,404
I'm calling the cops on you!

417
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:46,761
I'm calling the cops on you!

418
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,876
Just look at this!

419
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,222
Look at this kid.

420
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:56,422
- You spoil her!
- Oh, stop it!

421
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,489
This is my car, my car,
my car, my car!

422
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:12,158
Mine! My car! My car!

423
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:13,841
God!

424
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,588
Are you OK?

425
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,214
Benton Harbor Street?

426
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,414
Yeah, well, I've never been
to Benton Harbor, OK?

427
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,619
You should've told me
you were using me.

428
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:34,204
Yeah, well, my parents are always
on my ass about where I'm going.

429
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:38,333
You know, she thinks I'm a loser.
She thinks all my friends are losers.

430
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:39,586
I just...

431
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:43,149
Wanted to bring home
someone like you.

432
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm sorry, OK?

433
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:48,301
Are you happy now?

434
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:51,419
Whatever. I just wish
you would've told me.

435
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:54,808
My stepfather wants to sell my car.
I don't think so.

436
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,431
With all the dirt I have on him,
he'd better just watch it.

437
00:24:57,556 --> 00:24:59,106
You know what I mean?

438
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:07,147
- So what are you going to do now?
- I'm going to find Daniel.

439
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,272
When he hears about this,
he's going to flip out.

440
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,952
Sorry to break it to you,
but you're the geek.

441
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,768
- What?
- You heard me. You're the geek.

442
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,493
I may be some things,
but I'm not a geek.

443
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:30,446
Hey, you guys, let's go make some
acid and pour it on the sidewalk.

444
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:31,776
Won't that be fun?

445
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,051
Watch it.
That stuff is expensive.

446
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:37,571
You're 14 years old and you
still play with chemistry sets?

447
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:40,946
Uh, hey, nimrod,
adults play with chemistry sets, too.

448
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,906
They're called scientists.

449
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:46,504
However, I don't know too many adults
who still play with their Tonka trucks.

450
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,339
I don't play with Tonka trucks.

451
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,543
You want to go on the record
with that statement?

452
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,868
I gave them away, like, years ago.

453
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,848
May I direct the jury's
attention to exhibit "A"?

454
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,675
May I direct the jury's
attention to exhibit "A"?

455
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,177
You and your lame impersonations.

456
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:06,677
Ever thought about
teaching a class in geek?

457
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:09,182
Hey, at least
I've got hair in my pits.

458
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:11,224
OK. OK.
Hey, Bill.

459
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:16,012
Who's the bigger geek?
Me or Neal? You decide.

460
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:19,203
Like, I don't...
Neither?

461
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,429
Come on.
You gotta choose.

462
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:28,618
I don't know.
I mean, what's geek mean anyway?

463
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:30,339
I mean, it's just a word.

464
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:32,896
- Come on, Bill.
- Yeah, pick.

465
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,346
I guess... Sam.

466
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,184
Oh, and the verdict is in.

467
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:46,328
You shouldn't feel so ashamed. There
are a lot of famous geeks in history.

468
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:49,072
Einstein, Gilligan, Gomer Pyle.

469
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,074
You know, it's all the s...

470
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,577
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Cut it out!

471
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:55,865
Stop it!

472
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,701
Give it a rest!
Come on.

473
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,645
Stop it. Stop!

474
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:04,566
You're going to tear my sweater.

475
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,991
You done with your little hissy fit?

476
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:12,833
Stop it! Hey, stop! Get off me!

477
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,802
- Guys, guys!
- My chemistry set!

478
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,277
- What is that?
- I don't know!

479
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,233
Cover your flesh.
Cover your flesh.

480
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:26,626
All right. That's it.

481
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:28,272
Guys, get out! Now!

482
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,258
There's his car.

483
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:36,783
Him and Nick like to come here
and shoot hoops sometimes.

484
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:04,892
You are dead!

485
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:07,770
You are so dead!
Do you hear me?

486
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,648
You are dead!
Both of you are dead!

487
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:19,529
She's pissed.

488
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,187
Well, maybe it's not what you think.

489
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,106
I mean, maybe they were
just goofing around.

490
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:55,856
You never know.

491
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,110
Oh, god.

492
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:01,988
God, Kim, I'm so s...

493
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:04,619
Don't touch me! Just don't touch me.

494
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:08,372
I never want to see him again.

495
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:12,168
It's just, you know,

496
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:16,148
he's the nicest guy
I've ever met. You know?

497
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,484
And he's such a babe, too.

498
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:24,472
I mean, he's sexier than Rod Stewart.
Don't you think?

499
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,710
Yeah, he's a really
good-looking guy.

500
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:32,897
I mean, Daniel...
Daniel is a normal guy, you know?

501
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,151
He'll screw anything that moves.

502
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:38,194
And that's why I got to stay alert.

503
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:40,562
I have to be a bitch, you know?

504
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,969
Oh, my life sucks!

505
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:47,344
No, it doesn't.

506
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,510
My parents hate me!
I don't have any friends!

507
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,223
You're, like,
my only friend, Lindsay,

508
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:54,335
and you're...

509
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,639
You're a total loser.

510
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,306
No offense.

511
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,890
Sam, slow down.
It's not a race.

512
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:14,594
What's the problem?

513
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:17,316
Oh, he usually never eats,

514
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,272
and just look at him.

515
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,925
Oh, he's fine.

516
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,115
He could use a little
meat on his bones.

517
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,973
I'm just worried
he might have worms.

518
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,552
Sam, do you think
you might have worms?

519
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,354
Mom?

520
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:36,544
Hey, Lindsay.

521
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:38,754
Is this your new friend?

522
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:41,921
- We're gonna be in my room.
- You sure you don't want any dinner?

523
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,296
No, we're fine.

524
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:44,924
What you eatin'?

525
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,399
Veal piccata.

526
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:48,428
It looks good.

527
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:51,267
Well, sit down.
I'll get you both a plate.

528
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:18,598
Is everything all right, Kim?

529
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,753
Mom, she's having problems
with her boyfriend.

530
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:24,328
She doesn't want
to talk about it, OK?

531
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,315
There, there.

532
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,485
I mean, you're a guy.

533
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:44,195
Right?

534
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:47,031
Why are guys only interested in sex?

535
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,347
It's so sick.

536
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,297
Damn.

537
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:05,814
What is it, Sam?

538
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,452
Is he going to blow up?

539
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,387
That's a perfectly good
piece of veal wasted.

540
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:17,212
I'm telling you,
I think he has a parasite.

541
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:19,426
I'll get it.

542
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,079
Hello.

543
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,793
Yes, this is she.

544
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,497
Oh, yes. Yeah,
they're both right here.

545
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:30,587
She is?

546
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,059
She did?

547
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,467
Really? Oh, my.

548
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,793
No, I had...
I had no idea.

549
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,314
No. Vacation home where?

550
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,027
You look familiar.

551
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,859
Does any of your family
shop at my store?

552
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:50,450
Yeah, but my mom hates going there
'cause it's so overpriced.

553
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:54,098
You know, you can get the same
stuff at Sportsmart for a lot less.

554
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,351
You don't say?

555
00:32:57,582 --> 00:33:00,021
OK, yes. Thank you.
Good-bye.

556
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,891
Can I see you
in the kitchen for a second?

557
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:19,429
That was Kim's mother on the phone.

558
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:21,431
- What is happening?
- What do you mean?

559
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:23,878
She was yelling at me.

560
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:27,590
She said you told them that we have
a vacation home in Benton Harbor,

561
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:31,547
that you and Kim stay out all night
and sleep with boys,

562
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,888
and that I shouldn't
believe a word you say.

563
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,344
Look, mom, none of that is true.

564
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:39,936
Kim got in a fight with her parents,
and Mrs. Kelly's just upset.

565
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:41,784
Well, now I'm upset.

566
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:43,397
Very upset.

567
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,608
Mom, come on.
I barely know Kim.

568
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:47,516
Good. Maybe that's for the best.

569
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:50,491
I don't think she's
a very positive influence.

570
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:54,122
Be a little understanding, Mom.
Kim comes from a broken home.

571
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:57,453
Her parents are deranged.
Not everybody's family is like ours.

572
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,770
I know that.
I just don't want to see you...

573
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,668
Thank you so much for dinner.

574
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,169
It was really great.

575
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:08,124
You guys have such a nice house.

576
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,981
You think it'd be cool
if I hung out here for a little bit?

577
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,970
My house is such
a nightmare right now.

578
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:15,852
Oh, of course.

579
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:18,327
Just, please, make yourself at home.

580
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,892
Thanks.

581
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,909
You think she might
like some ice cream?

582
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,401
<i>I think he's stoned.</i>

583
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,388
<i>Stoned? What are you talking about?</i>

584
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:38,407
<i>Hey, what do you say
we guys go down to the beach</i>

585
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:40,082
<i>and shoot some clams?</i>

586
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,950
I hate cop shows.

587
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:43,913
Cops are such pigs.

588
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,883
My brother got ambushed
by cops once.

589
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,029
They beat him on the head
with their billy clubs.

590
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,887
Oh, my. What was he doing?

591
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:54,135
Nothing. He was just drunk,
minding his own business.

592
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,271
The cops just went nuts on him.

593
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:59,899
Now he sleeps all day on the couch,
and he never parties.

594
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:01,851
I think he's got brain damage.

595
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:05,014
<i>Take these things,
have them analyzed, fast. Nick?</i>

596
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,522
<i>Not that way!</i>

597
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,123
I'll get it!

598
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,200
Hey, Nick.
What's going on?

599
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:22,872
Daniel's waiting out at the car,
and he wants to talk to Kim.

600
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:25,499
I don't think
now is a very good time.

601
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,017
She's really mad.

602
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:31,714
Hey, Kim. Thanks a lot for
almost running me over back there!

603
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,232
What do you want?

604
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:38,147
Daniel's out at the car,
and he would like to talk with you.

605
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:41,313
What are you, his chore boy?
Why don't you go tell your master

606
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,726
I don't ever want to
talk to him again? He's scum!

607
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,895
He's waiting outside.
Go tell him yourself.

608
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,444
No way. I'm not going out there.
You can just forget it.

609
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,274
Go tell him to go to hell!

610
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:51,571
Look,

611
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:55,279
if you don't go out there,
then he's just going to come in here.

612
00:35:56,038 --> 00:35:58,905
Maybe you should talk to the boy...
Outside.

613
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,285
Just tell him how you feel, honey.

614
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,333
I'm not going to talk
to him again. Ever!

615
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,540
So you can all just bite me!

616
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,298
If she's planning on sleeping over,
she can just forget about it.

617
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:27,309
You scared me!

618
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,818
- Crap!
- Get outta here.

619
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:34,938
What?

620
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:37,263
You heard me.
Get out of my room.

621
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:41,284
- After all you did to me today.
- What did I do to you?

622
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,327
You wrote geek on my locker.

623
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:46,289
Hey, I didn't do that.
Karen did that.

624
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,495
Oh, yeah, well, she's your friend,

625
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,480
and you were laughing.

626
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:55,333
You know what it feels like to
have that written on your locker?

627
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:56,465
Jeez!

628
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,801
Now I have to write
this stupid essay.

629
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,297
OK, listen.

630
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:03,142
Karen is not my friend, OK?

631
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:06,559
Just wait.
Tomorrow she's going to learn.

632
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,960
- What goes around comes around.
- What do you mean?

633
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,153
Just don't worry about her.
She's dead meat.

634
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:14,278
Really?

635
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:17,103
She messed with the wrong
person this time.

636
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,690
I'm just going to break her arms.

637
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,212
- Seriously?
- And after I break her arms,

638
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:26,082
I'm going to take a wrench,
and pull out her teeth one by one.

639
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:28,945
And then I'm going to take a match,
and set her hair on fire.

640
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,070
Well, don't hurt her too bad.

641
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:32,993
Just wait.

642
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:36,048
She's going to wish
she was never born.

643
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:44,150
Hey, Lindsay, how's it...
How's it going?

644
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,803
How's it going?
It's going bad.

645
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:50,227
Those guys are going to make up,
you know? Don't worry about it.

646
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,934
She's really pissed.

647
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:54,259
She's always pissed off, you know?

648
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:57,440
You just got to try to,
like, calm down a little bit.

649
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:59,942
I know. It's just,
tonight has been really intense.

650
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:01,667
You seem really tense.

651
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:04,487
Hey, come here.
Um, here.

652
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:15,038
Ah! Harold!

653
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:18,047
Lady, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm just looking for my girlfriend.

654
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:21,826
Mom?

655
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,397
Hey, Lindsay,
the door was open, so...

656
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:25,808
Who's this punk?

657
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,588
Dad, this is Daniel.
He's a friend from school.

658
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:31,894
Jeez, kid, you ever hear of a doorbell?
People do have heart attacks, you know.

659
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,662
Oh, yeah. Sorry, pops.

660
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,578
- Where's Kim?
- She doesn't want to see you.

661
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:40,115
That's right, so why don't
you get the hell out of here?

662
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,398
- Will you let me explain?
- What, that I hate you?

663
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,752
I didn't do nothin'.

664
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:46,534
Oh, {\you didn't do anything.}I'm sorry, that must've been
somebody else.

665
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,161
Will you just calm down
and not be a bitch for one second?

666
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,319
What did you call me?

667
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,960
I said calm down! OK?

668
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,317
Just don't...

669
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:00,319
I saw her sucking on your finger!

670
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:02,822
- What else has she sucked on?
- Are you high right now?

671
00:39:02,947 --> 00:39:04,385
No, I am not high!

672
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:07,506
Just don't! You know?
Just don't lie to me!

673
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:09,762
- I'm not lying.
- Don't lie to me!

674
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:11,934
- I'm not lying.
- Just don't! You know?

675
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,553
Just stop lying to me!

676
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:16,485
I know that you slept with her!

677
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,611
I'm not lying. OK?

678
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,314
I'm not lying.

679
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:24,994
Oh, just...

680
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,619
I didn't do nothin'.

681
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:29,472
There's only you.

682
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
OK?

683
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:39,837
God, you suck.

684
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,961
There's nobody but you.

685
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,465
Mom, dad.

686
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,632
No. No, it's not OK.

687
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:56,171
I'm still mad at you.

688
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:02,443
It's just... no.

689
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,111
Lindsay, who are these people?

690
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:07,002
Mom, dad, this is Nick.

691
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:11,619
Hi. Hey, Mr. Weir.
Hi, Mrs. Weir.

692
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:13,915
I just want you to know it's, like,

693
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,640
such a pleasure to
meet you guys finally.

694
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,965
Uh, Lindsay turned out great!

695
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,156
She's... so great.

696
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,215
Congratulations.

697
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,718
- Thanks.
- Hey, so, um, listen,

698
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,473
do you guys mind if I have
this fruit roll-up?

699
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,687
Oh, no. Please...
Go... please, go ahead.

700
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:37,186
Enjoy.

701
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,919
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

702
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:45,861
I think they've made up.
Let's go check on them.

703
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,738
- Mom, no.
- Oh, Lindsay.

704
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:51,647
I think we deserve to see
a happy ending, don't you, Harold?

705
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:56,397
These friends of yours gonna be
leaving our house in the near future?

706
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,522
Mom, wait.

707
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:02,265
Oh, my.

708
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:13,202
Listen, uh, I just wanted to tell you,
I think you got a great store.

709
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:15,204
There's a lot of
great stuff in there.

710
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,206
I bought a basketball
a couple of years ago.

711
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:19,708
- It still works and everything.
- Good.

712
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,710
You guys mind if I have these or...

713
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:23,964
Please, go ahead.
Take them.

714
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:27,216
Thanks so much for dinner
and ice cream and everything.

715
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,951
It was really good to meet you guys.

716
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:32,389
Super nice.

717
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,982
- Good luck with your parents.
- Oh! Don't remind me.

718
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:40,737
Hey, you think it's cool
if I leave my car here tonight?

719
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:43,294
I'll pick it up tomorrow.
We could hang out.

720
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:44,841
Great.

721
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:49,863
Maybe we can all
have dinner tomorrow night.

722
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:59,308
Well, I got a ton of homework to do,
so I guess I better go hit the books.

723
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,433
Huh, Dad?

724
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:03,638
Good night.

725
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,890
This isn't good.

726
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:09,683
No.

727
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Hi, Sam.

728
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:21,093
You going to class?

729
00:42:22,314 --> 00:42:23,314
Yeah.

730
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,349
Hey, Sam Weir.

731
00:42:27,474 --> 00:42:29,001
Where's my essay?

732
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:37,853
OK. You know what we're going to do?

733
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:41,208
We're going to post this on your locker
so that everyone in McKinley

734
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,583
can learn from your little mistake.

735
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:52,017
All right, I give up.

736
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:55,342
If you kids want to live in trash,
that's fine by me.

737
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,629
Did you do this?

738
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:03,495
I did it.

739
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:07,510
Because you are a slut, slut.

740
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,653
He hit on me.

741
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:13,028
Oh, yeah? Well, after school,
I'm going to hit on you.

742
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:14,780
See you then.

743
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:18,242
Bye.

744
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,060
Hey, Kim, thanks.
That was really cool.

745
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,708
No problem, geek.
