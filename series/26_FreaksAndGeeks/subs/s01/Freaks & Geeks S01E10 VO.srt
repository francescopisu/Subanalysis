Freaks and Geeks S01E10 The Diary (VO)

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
Nice muffler!

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,300
We should definitely be getting a ride.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,300
Right here is the best spot.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,300
This is cool.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,300
Hitchhiking.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,300
It's, like, in kerouac, you know?

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,300
Kerouac?

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
Jack kerouac.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,300
He wrote on the road.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
Kim, we've been reading it in english class

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,400
For the last 2 weeks. where've you been?

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,900
All we ever do in that class is read.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Stick
out your thumb, would ya?

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,900
We're so sheltered, you know?

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,900
There's this whole other america out there.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
And the person who picks
us up could be an artist

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Or a psychic or an escaped felon.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It's so exciting.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Ok, one thing that helps...

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Point your boobs towards the road.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,300
Redneck!

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,800
Oops...i mean...

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
So, are you from around these parts?

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,600
1210 lilac terrace.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Oh.

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,600
So what do you do?

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,600
You pick up hitchhikers a lot?

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Listeni know you.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
I buy gear from your dad's store.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't think you girls
should be doin' this,

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,000
And i feel obliged to
tell him what you're up to.

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,000
This...the thumb?

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,500
Do you think i don't know what that means?

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,500
I know, lindsay.

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,500
It means, "hey, stranger,

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,000
"Please lock me in your car,

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Drive me to god knows where and murder me."

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Dad, you're overreacting.

63
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Lindsay, i will not have my
daughter hopping into cars

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
Like some woman of the night.

65
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,900
You could have been picked up by ted bundy.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Dad, kim does it all the time.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,400
Don't be so overdramatic.

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,500
What, her parents let her hitchhike?

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,500
Oh, i don't know.

70
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,900
I bet she doesn't even have parents.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,900
Of course she does, dad.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Mom, you talked to her mom on the phone.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Well, maybe we should meet her.

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,300
I used to know all your friends' parents.

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
You know...

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
We should invite her over for dinner.

77
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,800
Get acquainted.

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,300
Yeah.

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Mom, no. Please?

80
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah, well, i think she oughta know

81
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,800
What a bad influence her
daughter is, don't you?

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,600
All right, guys,

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Let's play a little softball.

84
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
Pick your team, gents.

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,800

Pick me, pick me.

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,000
Winnington.

93
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,500
No...he sucks.

94
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Mike.

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,400
I'm good. justin.

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,500

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Ok, white.

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Come on. let's go.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,000
There is no language in our lungs

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ttell the world just how we feel

102
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Bridge of thoughts

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,500
No mental link

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,500
No letting out just what you think

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
There is no language in our lungs

107
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,800
Lungs, lungs, lungs

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,800
There is no muscle in our tongues

109
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,800
Tongues, tongues, tongues

110
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Hey.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Hey, nick.

112
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,600

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
It's goin'.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,300
Great.

115
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Yeah.

116
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,700
It is great.

117
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
It's never been greater.

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey.

119
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Hey, kim.

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,700
So...what happened with your parents?

121
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
You, like, grounded?

122
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, not exactly.

123
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,500
My parents wanna meet your mom.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,500
What?

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,500
Yeah, they wanna get to know her.

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,500
Shut up.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
No, i'm serious.

128
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,500
They're inviting her over for dinner.

129
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Could you be quiet, please?

130
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Class is starting.

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Today...we are not in a classroom.

132
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,000
We are in a coffeehouse.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
And you are not students.

134
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,000
You are beat poets.

135
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,500
And we're gonna be reading aloud.

136
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,400
Hey,
batta-batta-batta.

137
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,900
Swing,
batta-batta-batta.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Miss! Batta-

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,400
Could you be quiet, please?

140
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah, i'm really a shortstop.

141
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Is that so?

142
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Hey, they got a meeting on the mound.

143
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
I wonder what they're talkin' about.

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah...

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,900
Must be fascinating.

146
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,300
I hate this.

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
This is so unfair.

148
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,300
Maybe i'm good.

149
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,300
They don't know.

150
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
Maybe i'm unbelievably good.

151
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,300
But are they ever gonna find out?

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Uh-uh. No.

153
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
Where i can
- 'cause they never put me in a position

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,900
Where i could catch a stupid ball.

155
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
I hate them.

156
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,600
Maybe they're scared of you.

157
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
Come on, ladies.

158
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,100
Maybe.

159
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,100
Hey, chuck!

160
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Look alive out there! come on!

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Let's play some ball.

162
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,100
Uh-huh. Wait.

163
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
All the teachers' numbers are there?

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah.

165
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,500
Ooh.

166
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,500
Phone.

167
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,800
Think we could be arrested
for making prank calls?

168
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,400
And we'll get sent yeah.to telephone prison.

169
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh. Ha ha.

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
Hello?

171
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Uh, hmm. Hello? coach fredricks?

172
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,200
Yes.

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,700
This is mr. Crisp.

174
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Gordon crisp's father.

175
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Mr. Crisp?

176
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Uh, how are you?

177
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
Not good. I want to give
you a piece of my mind.

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,700
I think it's very unfair

179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,200
The way you've been running
baseball in gym class.

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
You always let the jock kids run the game.

181
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Now, some kids, like gordon my son,

182
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Never-never get a chance

183
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
'Cause you guys think he's not very good.

184
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,000
For example, he may wanna play shortstop,

185
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,000
But, uh, yeah, you never give him a shot.

186
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,000
Look, i'm sorry, but, uh,
you know i always assumed

187
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,500
Gordon, uh, didn't have
any interest in sports.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
You know what i'm sayin'?

189
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, he does.

190
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,400
Don't judge a book by its cover.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Oh,
i-i-i, uh,

192
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I apologize. All right?

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll rectify the situation immediately.

194
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,400
Ok, then. thank you very much.

195
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Good-bye now.

196
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,900
All right, bye.

197
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Gordon crisp!

198
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,000
I did it.

199
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
What did he say?

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
He totally bought i

201
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,600
He called me mr. Crisp and everything.

202
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,700
Fellas, i just changed our lives.

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,200
Oh, great.

204
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Now we're gonna have to
actually play baseball.

205
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,700
Thanks a lot.

206
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I can't wait till tomorrow.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
You have such a lovely house.

208
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Thank you.

209
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I had a beautiful house once.

210
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Up on maple drive.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,900
Mmm.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,900
Then kim's father left me with 2 kids,

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,400
And a huge mortgage and, well...

215
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,400
That's life, huh?

216
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,400
I can't imagine how difficult it must be

217
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,400
To raise children by yourself.

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Ohit isn't easy.

219
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Chip, my oldest, oh, he's a doll.

220
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,400
He's got water in his brain,
but, oh, he's a sweet kid.

221
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,900
Kim, she's another story.

222
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
Yeah, tell us about kim.

223
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,900
Well she ain't the
sharpest crayon in the box.

224
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,400
She's a big pain in the neck.

225
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
And i know she hates me for being strict...

226
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,400
I get worried.

227
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,900
Of course you do.

228
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Becaus

229
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,400
E i don't know what she's doin' out there.

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,900
She lies.

231
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,300
These girls today, they all lie.

232
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
She says to me...

233
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
"I mm-hmm.

234
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
'M gonna go study at the library."

235
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
She goes to a party. she gets loaded.

236
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,800
She says she's seein' a movie...

237
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,300
She's foolin' around with
some guy in the back of a van.

238
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh, my.

239
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,700
Want to know how i find out?

240
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,700
How?

241
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,700
I read her diary.

242
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
I sneak into her room, and i read it.

243
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,200
Oh, she won't do her homework,

244
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
But she's got a freakin' novel in there.

245
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,100
I have to.

246
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
It's the only way i get the truth.

247
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
And you wanna know somethin'?

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
The truth is very scary.

249
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,600
Because times have changed.

250
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
These girls today...

251
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh, they run wild.

252
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Hey.

253
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,300
So how was dinner?

254
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Lindsay, your mother and i don't
want you spending any more time

255
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
With kim kelly. do you understand?

256
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,800
No, dad, she's my friend.

257
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,800
I mean, yes, she's not like millie, but-

258
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,800
No, she's not like millie, all right.

259
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,200
She's as dumb as a crayon.

260
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Even her own mother says so.

261
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Dad, just because kim's mother is insane-

262
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,900
No, she's not insane, honey,
she's practically a saint.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Lindsay, do you know what happens

264
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
When you put a rotten
banana in a fruit bowl?

265
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,000
All the other bananas go rotten.

266
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
And that's what a bad banana.

267
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Mrs. Kelly had some pretty alarming
things to tell us about kim.

268
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,500
Like what?

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
That she experiments.

270
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
With drugs!

271
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
And boys!

272
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Is that true, honey?

273
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Enough said.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, no more kim kelly!

275
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,800
You know, maybe she needs her head shrunk.

276
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
Harold...

277
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
It's about trust, and frankly...

278
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
I don't think i trust her anymore.

279
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Lindsay's always been very honest with us.

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah?

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
Well, she told us she didn't cheat.

282
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,000
And we believed her.

283
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,100
We ended up with egg on our faces.

284
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,600
Does lindsay have a diary?

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah. I think i've seen her writing in it.

286
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Harold, no!

287
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
That is her private property.

288
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I just wanna know what's going on.

289
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
I had a diary when i was little.

290
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,000
If my parents had read it,
i would've been furious.

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's such a violation.

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Spooning with a stranger

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
In the back seat oa van, that's a violation!

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,500
She hasn't done that.

295
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,300
There's only one way to know for sure.

296
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Good night, dear.

297
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Good night.

298
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Gotall right, i want crisp.

299
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
You heard him, crisp, come on.

300
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,800

301
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,300
You wanna play shortstop?

302
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,800
No. No, i like playing back-up right.

303
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You sure?

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah, i like playing back-up.

305
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
I can play shortstop.

306
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,600
Yeah. And, uh, i'm married to raquel welch.

307
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,600
In my dreams.

308
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,100

309
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,100
All right, i'm gonna
take, uh, not haverchuck.

310
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Heh heh. Funny.

311
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Hey!

312
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,600
Hey, kim.

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,100
So my mom, like, loved your parents.

314
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
Guess it went all right.

315
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah, i guess.

316
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
What did your parents say?

317
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,100
Oh, they really liked your mom.

318
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,300
Cool. You know, i'm glad it worked out.

319
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
And they also said...

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Oh, they're such dorks.

321
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Get this.

322
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm not allowed to hang out with you.

323
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,800
It'll blow over.

324
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,800
We've just got to wait
it out a while, you know?

325
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,800
Oh.

326
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Well, what did they say about me?

327
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
I don't know.

328
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
No, you can tell me.

329
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm interested.

330
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,700
He said you're a bad banana.

331
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,700
Aren't they queer?

332
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
Yeah, what does that mean, you know?

333
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,700
I don't know. I guess like a bad influence.

334
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Well, what else did they say about me?

335
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Tell me!

336
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Kim, i don't know.

337
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,700
You're not smart, you
do drugs, you have sex...

338
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Stupid stuff like that.

339
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,300
My parents are morons, kim.

340
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,300
Wait. You don't actually think that i care

341
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
About what your parents think of me, do you?

342
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,400
No. Of course not.

343
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
No.

344
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Lindsay!

345
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Mueves tu cula.

346
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Uh, just a minute.

347
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,800
En espanol.

348
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
Lo siento senor o'hara,

349
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,300
Pero esta hablando con mi amiga.

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
Es importante.

351
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,300
La clase es importante, tambien.

352
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,300
Yo se, pero puede esterar
un momento por favor.

353
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,800
Kim!

354
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Senorita, ahora.

355
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,300
What?

356
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,800
Well, i'll talk to you later, right?

357
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Yeah. Sure.

358
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Lindsay?

359
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,800
Why do you keep calling her name?

360
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,300
She's in school, for god's sake.

361
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,300
My heart is racing, harold.

362
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,300
I don't think we should be doing this.

363
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Well, look, jean, we wanna find out

364
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,200
What's going on in our
daughter's life, don't we?

365
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I mean, for all we know,
she could become a junkie

366
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Or a hooker!

367
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Harold, she is not gonna become a hooker.

368
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,600
Well, everybody's got parents, jean.

369
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
Even hookers.

370
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,100
Remember that tv movie we saw?

371
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,100
Shh. Hurry up.

372
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
These stamps...

373
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,100
I heard the kids put
lsd on the back of them.

374
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Are you there, god? it's me, margaret.

375
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,100
What?

376
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Oh, just the name of a book.

377
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,500
Aha! Birth control pills.

378
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,000
Our little daughter with a...

379
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,000
Sewing kit.

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Harold... What?

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Here it is.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,100
You got it?

383
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,600
Well, come on. break it out.

384
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,100
Maybe we should do this later.

385
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
Now, jean, look...

386
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
My lunch hour's almost over.

387
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,900
The store's not gonna run itself.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Come on, let's go. shh-shh.

389
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,400
"Warning to all snoops! do
not read beyond this page.

390
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,400
"If you read on, it's because you
have no life and nothing better to do

391
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,900
"Than to pry into mine.

392
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,900
"Anyone who keeps reading on is cursed

393
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,900
And will suffer until they
die a slow and painful death."

395
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Real scared. Read on!

396
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
What's it y about kim kelly?

397
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh, nothing. Just that
she thinks kim has, uh...

398
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
What? well, uh, uh...

399
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,800
A different word for courage.

400
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Not...oh.

401
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Well, does it say anything about drugs?

402
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Pot? Acid?

403
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I don't think so.

404
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Well, what does it say?

405
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh, here, here. "i'm-i'm sick of living

406
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,800
In this claustrophobic suburban world..."

407
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
Oh, get used to it.

408
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
"Where everyone is trying to fit in.

409
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,800
"I feel like i live in
a world of scared robots.

410
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,300
"Honestly, this is terrible,

411
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
But 2 of the worst ones are mom and dad."

412
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,800
What? What does that mean?

413
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
"They are the most boring repressed people

414
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
On the face of the entire earth."

415
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
Repressed? i'll repress her.

416
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
"They say they love each
other, but who knows?

417
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,300
"It's probably just part of their routine.

418
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,300
Anyway, can robots really be in love?"

419
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
Harold, i-i don't think
we suld be reading this.

420
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,200
Yeah-yeah, keep reading.

421
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,700
Let's see...

422
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,200
"Their whole life is
this monotonous routine.

423
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,200
"She cooks dinner, practically
the same meal every night.

424
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
"He comes home barking at
everyone like a fascist dictator

425
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,700
Who's scared his..."

426
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,900
What?

427
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,700
"Who's scared his penis will fall off

428
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Walk all over her.

429
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Not the life for me.

430
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,100
No, thank you."

431
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,100
I'll get it in the other room.

432
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
The worst would be getting
eaten alive by wolves.

433
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,100
From the feet up.

434
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,600
Uh-uh. No.

435
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
It'd be worse if you were,
like, a deep-sea diver,

436
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,100
And you came up too quick
and your head, like, exploded.

437
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Oh, yeah, that's worse. lot of pressure-

438
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,600
You know, you guys are really morbid.

439
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Kim, you asked the question.

440
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah, but i didn't think
we'd be talking about it

441
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,100
For half an hour. hey, guys.

442
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,100
Hey.

443
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
I gotta, uh...

444
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,000
Go to shop class.

445
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,500
I sorta told ken i'd meet him there.

446
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,100
Yeah...you know, come to think of it...

447
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
I should probably get going, too.

448
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
'Cause i gotta go...

449
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
You know, do drugs...

450
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
Oh, yeah, and have sex.

451
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,600
What?

452
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Lindsay knows what i'm talking about.

453
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Oh...

454
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,100
Is this about what my parents said?

455
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Oh! You know what, i told you, lindsay,

456
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,300
I don't give what your parents say about me.

457
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Well, why are you so mad?

458
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,400
Well, i do give what
my friends say about me.

459
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I didn't say anything.

460
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Uh, you sure know how to clear a room.

461
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,200
Is this the best cereal you've got?

462
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
I don't know.

463
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
I never eat breakfast.

464
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
I just have my coffee.

465
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Before or after you shave?

466
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Don't you have any sugar cereals?

467
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,600
Not in this house. rots the choppers.

468
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Hey,ad.

469
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,100
Oh, hey, dr. Schweiber.

470
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,300
Sam, bill.

471
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Got your shoes off?

472
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Good.

473
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,100
So you guys got big plans for the afternoon?

474
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,100
Not really.

475
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,800
We're gonna make some phone calls.

476
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
Ix-nay ig-bay
outh-may.

477
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400

Hey-hey-hey!

478
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,900
I speak pig latin, too, you know.

479
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Who you guys gonna call?

480
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,400
Mean people.

481
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,300
Oh. Prank calls, huh?

482
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,800
Oh, well. Boys will be boys.

483
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I could tell you some
great prank call stories.

484
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Really?

485
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,200
All right.

486
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Just one.

487
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,200
We used to pick out a number,

488
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,200
And we'd call it over
and over and over again.

489
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,700
We'd keep asking for maurice, you know?

490
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,700
We'd call and say, "hello, is maurice there?

491
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,700
"Hello, is maurice there?

492
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,200
Hey, is maurice at home?"

493
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,200
You got the idea? We'd
call for maurice a lot.

494
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,200
We'd call back an hour later and go,
"hello. This is maurice. Any messages?"

495
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Anyway...

496
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,700
Just keep it clean, all right?

497
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,700
No heavy breathing.

498
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,700
Ok. See you later, short-stuff.

499
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,700
Ok.

500
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Heavy breathing. that's a good idea.

501
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
He

502
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Y, i thought your dad worked during the day.

503
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
Mmm. Sometimes he comes
home to change his shirt.

504
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Root canals make him sweaty.

505
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Listen to this. this is gonna be good.

506
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Hello?

508
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,700
You're a turd. a stinky, fat turd.

509
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,900
Go sniff a jockstrap, you poop-head.

510
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,900
You love patting boys' butts.

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,900
Butt
- you butt patter.

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,900
You're a perv and a loser...

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And a stinky...turd.

514
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,000
Who was that?

515
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,000
It's, uh, an old friend.

516
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,500
Oh-ho.

517
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh, you better hope he doesn't find you out.

518
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
You know, if the cops trace that...

519
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,900
You're so dead.

520
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,900
No, if the cops trace the call, you're dead.

521
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,700
Who does she think she is, anyway?

522
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,700
I don't know.

523
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,700
Let's talk about it for 4
more hours and try to find out.

524
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,700
Oh! And you should've
heard her speaking spanish.

525
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,200
"Un moment-un
moment. kim-kim!"

526
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,200
Oh, that sounds terrible.

527
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Yeah. She thinks she's the
queen of england or something.

528
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,800
Hmm.

529
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Oh, man!

530
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
You know, will you get me a stick?

531
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I'm gonna kill that dog!

532
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Gross.

533
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,400
I mean, who are they, you know?

534
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,900
The great weirs to call me
a whore and a drug addict?

535
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,100
Well, they didn't actually call
you a whore and a drug addict.

536
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,100
Basically, they did.

537
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,600
And...i'm not just some whore, you know?

538
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,600
They just can't take it
that i have sex, you know?

539
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,600
They're afraid some bad
man's gonna come along

540
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,000
And soil their perfect little daughter.

541
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,300
Well, you do have sex.

542
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Well, yeah. with you.

543
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,200
Yeah, and i'm a bad man.

544
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,500
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

545
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I don't know.

546
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,200
If i had some daughter in high school,

547
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,700
I wouldn't want some guy
crawlin' all over her.

548
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,100
What the hell are you talking about?

549
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,100
I'm just saying it's not
like they don't have a point.

550
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I mean, who wants their kid
to have sex and do drugs?

551
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,600
Nobody.

552
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
You're a jerk.

553
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Hey, don't get mad at me.

554
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm just tryin' to be rational.

555
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,200
Are you calling me irrational?

556
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,700
Because i'll tear your head off, daniel.

557
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll tear it off, and i'll
throw it over that fence.

558
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,700
Hey.

559
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm not saying i don't love you.

560
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I like the way you are.

561
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,700
You probably just scare
the hell out of them.

562
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Oh. And how am i?

563
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,200
You...

564
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Are a sex-crazed drug addict.

565
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Screw you!

566
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Hey, come on.

567
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I didn't mean nothin'.

568
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm just tryin' to spice
up the conversation.

569
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,400
Sam, you getting a kickback
from the fire department?

570
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,400
No. Mom was the one who put
the candles on the table.

571
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,900
Ok. I've got something
special for us tonight.

572
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
Ta-da!

573
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,400
What the hell?

574
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,400
Uh, harold, they're cornish
game hen with a plum wine sauce.

575
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
They're fantastic.

576
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,400
What'd you do, put poison in a bird feeder?

577
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,900
They're exotic.

578
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,400
Is it a pigeon?

579
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,900
It is not a pigeon.

580
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
It's a kind of a chicken.

581
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,000
Jean, you know we can afford
to buy fully grown chickens.

582
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That-a-girl,
lindsay.

583
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
It's good to try new things.

584
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,400
Lindsay, watch out!

585
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
That little miniature bird
of yours is trying to escape!

586
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
But don't worry!

587
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,500
My little chicken will help him

588
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
'Cause i'm a brave little chicken!

589
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm the hero, am i not?

590
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
Yes! Is that right?

591
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
That's right.

592
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,000
Follow me! We will go! let's take off! Whoa!

593
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,500
Whoo!

594
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,000
Hey, mom, dad's playing with his food.

595
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, it's better than eating it.

596
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Just try it.

597
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They're delicious.

598
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Help yourself to mine.

599
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm gonna go make a sandwich.

600
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,900
Yeah, me, too.

601
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,400
Sit down.

602
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,300
Harold, if you're not gonna eat,

603
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Help clear the table.

604
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
What?

605
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
That's not my job.

606
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,900
Oh, but it's mine?

607
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Yes.

608
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,900
You don't run a store for 12 hours a day.

609
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,600
All right, settle down.

610
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Don't bother changing yet.

611
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
Oh, great. scoliosis testing again.

612
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Shut it.

613
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,100
I'veot something serious to say.

614
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,500
I've been getting prank
phone calls at my house.

615
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Now, i know we got a lot of jokers here,

616
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,000
A lot of funny guys.

617
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
Let me tell you something.

618
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,800
What you're doing is not funny.

619
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,800
It's annoying.

620
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,800
More importantly, it's illegal.

621
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,500
So i want every one of you comedians

622
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,000
In my office one at a time.

623
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Let's go.

624
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,400
Smooth move, alexander graham bell.

625
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,500
Read it.

626
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,700
Ahem.

627
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,000
"You...are a turd.

628
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,500
A stinky turd."

629
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,000
"Go sniff a jockstrap, you poop-head."

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,500
"Hey, fredricks, you
love patting boys' butts.

631
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,900
You love patting boys' butts."

632
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,500
You are a dimwit...

633
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,500
And an imbecile.

634
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,500
I blow my nose in your general direction.

635
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
That's not in there.

636
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
It isn't?

637
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,900
"Hey, fredricks,

638
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,900
"You love patting boys' butts.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,900
Butt, butt...patter."

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,600
Start it again. make it lower.

641
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,100
"Hey, fredricks,

642
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
You love patting boys' butts."

643
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Ha ha ha ha!

644
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
"You're a perv...

645
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
"And a loser...

646
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
And a turd."

647
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,500
"Go snik a-

648
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Go sniff..."

649
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Sniff?

650
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Sniff.

651
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,600
"A jockstrap, you poop-head."

652
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,100
"Youare a turd,

653
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,600
"A stinky turd.

654
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Go sniff a jockstrap, you poop-head."

655
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,100
Jeez, coach, this is harsh.

656
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,000
Ha ha ha ha!

657
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,500
"You're a perv and a loser

658
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
And a turd."

659
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
You know what? why don't you do spock?

660
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,500
All right? Go ahead. do leonard nimoy.

661
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Ahem.

662
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,100
Low.

663
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,600
Speak low.

664
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
"You're a
- you're a perv...

665
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
"And a loser...

666
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,600
And a...turd."

667
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Ok. I've heard enough.

668
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
, You think you're a comedian, hmm?

669
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,500
Why don't you tell me a joke?

670
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,000
A-a joke?

671
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,500
Mm-hmm.

672
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,100
Come on. Gimme something to make me laugh.

673
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,600
I don't know.

674
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,900
Ok. A guy goes into a bar
with a pig with a wooden leg.

675
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,400
See, i don't stifle.

676
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Think we share a similar sense of humor.

677
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I didn't do it to be funny.

678
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah?

679
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
So you did it to, uh, to what?

680
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,300
To be educational?

681
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
It's not fair.

682
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,800
Ok, you don't understand.

683
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,300
It's not like anyone
forgets who gets picked last.

684
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
I've always been picked last.

685
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,300
Everyone knows. girls know.

686
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,300
And the thing is, i might not be bad.

687
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,300
I never get better because
i'm never given the chance.

688
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,300
But i could be good.

689
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,800
You know, i mean, i know i could be good.

690
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,800
But it's not my fault you get picked last.

691
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,700
Yes, it is.

692
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,700
I mean, you've got all the power.

693
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
You could change everything.

694
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,700
And how would i do that?

695
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,600
Simple.

696
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,600
Let me pick the teams.

697
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Hey, lindsay...

698
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,500
I can't take it anymore.

699
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
You gotta talk to kim.

700
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
Why? Does she wanna talk to me?

701
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't know,

702
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,500
But you gotta do something.

703
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,000
She's driving me nuts.

704
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,900
She's bitching nonstop about her mom, you,

705
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Your parents.

706
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,900
I'm dying.

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,400
Why is she going so crazy?

708
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,400
She says you didn't stick up for her.

709
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,900
I tried.

710
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,400
She's still mad.

711
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I know, but mostly just
her feelings are hurt.

712
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh, really?

713
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,900
Hmm. Thought kim was too tough
to have her feelings hurt.

714
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,300
Yeah, right.

715
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Kim?

716
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
She's like the rawest nerve there is.

717
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,300
Yeah. She's like a body without skin.

718
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
She's like a bloody-

719
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Ok! I get it.

720
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
Can you do it soon?

721
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,900
'Cause she's really being a pain in my ass.

722
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,400
Yeah, ok.

723
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,300
Great. I owe you my life.

724
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Thanks.

725
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,900

750
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Today we are going to continue
our discussion ofon the road.

751
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,000
Ms. Proetzel's comments last
time about pioneer symbolism

752
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,500
Were particularly interesting.

753
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Kelly, i am sure that you
have some original insights.

754
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Tell me, what, in your opinion,

755
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is the theme ofon the road?

756
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,100
The theme... ofon the road

757
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,700
Is...

758
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,700
The theme's about...

759
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,900
The theme is...

760
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,400
America

761
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,800
And...

762
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,300
Being...

763
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,300
On the road.

764
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,400
On the roadis about being on the road.

765
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,600
That's good.

766
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,000
You...go on.

767
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,900
I hated the book, all right?

768
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I have no idea what it's about,

769
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,400
And the writer was clearly
on drugs when he wrote it.

770
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I mean, it went on and on and on,

771
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,900
Like it was written in a total hurry.

772
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,900
If i handed in something like this,

773
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
There's no way i'd get a good grade on it.

774
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,800
I mean, it's boring, and it's unorganized,

775
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,400
And i only read 30 pages of it anyway.

776
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,900
Well, that was passionate,

777
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,500
Albeit entirely misinformed.

778
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,500
Who dares follow miss
kelly's lucid analysis, hmm?

779
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes.

780
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,200
Well, i think kim's right.

781
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,200
Kerouac was high on benzedrine

782
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,200
During the 3 weeks he
took to writeon the road.

783
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,500
The structure of the story isn't strong,

784
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,100
And his experiments with
prose style are tedious.

785
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,500
In fact, truman capote
said abouton the road,

786
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,500
"That isn't writing. it's typing."

787
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Pearls before swine.

788
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,100
What the hell does that mean?

789
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,200
Hey, man, sure had a lot of
fun with your wife last night.

790
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,600
My what?

791
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,300
Ball 4. Take your base.

792
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,300
I mean, a lot of fun!

793
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,300
What's the matter with you? are you hurt?

794
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,200
Um...time!

795
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,700
All right, time out!

796
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,500
What? I told you i couldn't pitch.

797
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,500
It's not about your pitching, sam.

798
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,700
Then what are you doing out here?

799
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,000
I just always wanted to
call a meeting on the mound.

800
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,100
This is so cool.

801
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,600
Hey.

802
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,500
Meeting on the mound?

803
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,000
Very cool.

804
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,400
Listen, bill, i've got nothing left.

805
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Why don't you just let
one of those jocks pitch?

806
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,400
What are you talking about?

807
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,400
This isourgame.

808
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,900
We can do this.

809
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,900
I don't want them to think they were right

810
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,900
For putting me in deep
right field for 11 years.

811
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,700
Come on!

812
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,900
He'sthe butt patter.

813
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Ugh!

814
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

815
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,100
Tag up!

816
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,600
We did it! we did it!

817
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,700
Tag up!

818
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,700
That's the first out, you morons!

819
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,200
Huh? oh.

820
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Well...

821
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,700
Only 82/3 more innings to go.

822
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Yeah!

823
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,700
Ha ha!

824
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,700
You see that? i looked like willie mays!

825
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,800
Hey, kim, kim.

826
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Kim!

827
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,300
Yeah?

828
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Can i talk to you for a minute?

829
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,800
What do you want?

830
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,800
What are you doing right now?

831
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Nothing.

832
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,300
Do you wanna come over my house?

833
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,800
I thought we could hang out.

834
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Well, what about your parents?

835
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
What about them?

836
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Daniel, i'll see you later.

837
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm gonna go over to lindsay's.

838
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,600
Ok. Later.

839
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
God, this is good.

840
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
With him,

841
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
And i'd puke my guts out.

842
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,100
Swear to god.

843
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,500
Jean, is the grocery
store out of normal food?

844
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Is that the problem?

845
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,900
This is normal food.

846
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,400
No. Normal food is pot roast.

847
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Normal food is meat loaf.

848
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,200
It is dead animal, and it is not on fire.

849
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,700
No! No! No, no!

850
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,900
Maybe some of us are up for something
a little different around here.

851
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Don't you wanna live life, harold?

852
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Or maybe you've just
turned into a mean old man.

853
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,200
Don't you run away from me!

854
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
What's wrong with us, harold?

855
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,900
What's happened to us?

856
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,400
We need change, don't we?

857
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,900
Things need to change.

858
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,800
I don't want us to just be robots.

859
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
We are not robots,

860
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And things do not need to change.

861
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,900
I like how things are.

862
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
I like eating the same things.

863
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,000
And you know why?

864
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,900
Because those are the thgs i like.

865
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,900
I like chicken, and i like pot roast.

866
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,900
And that's how i feel about you, jean.

867
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,900
Oh, please.

868
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,900
You like me like you like a pot roast?

869
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,900
I love pot roast!

870
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,600
God, you just don't get it, do you?!

871
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,600
I give up! I quit!

872
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,400
Is that right?

873
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,700
Yes! You don't appreciate me.

874
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,300
Maybe i'll go back to school.

875
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,400
What about that?

876
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,900
You think i don't appreciate you?

877
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,900
Well, i do.

878
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Everything i do, i do to serve you.

879
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,100
I think of you when i'm...

880
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,600
Stocking fishing poles, and...

881
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I think of you when i'm answering
questions about cross-country ski wax.

882
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,600
My whole life is about serving you.

883
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,600
And i love you, jean.

884
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Thank you.

885
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,000
Really?

886
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Mom, dad, we're home.

887
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,900
Ooh.

888
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Is this what's for dinner?

889
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Ugh.

890
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:42,100
Mom?

891
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,700
Mom? Dad?

892
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Jean: ha ha ha! harold: grr! Grr!

893
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,900
Eww!

894
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,400
Oh, go

895
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,400
D. let's get outta here.

896
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Neal!

897
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,700
Those are my parents!

898
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,400
Ok, ok.

899
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
God, you're gross.

900
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,500
What?

901
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,000
Hey, linds...

902
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I know what you're trying to do,

903
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,700
But, you know, we don't have to do this.

904
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,700
No.

905
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,700
I want to.

906
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,500
All right, but if they call the cops on me,

907
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm outta here.

908
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,500
Hey Lindsay !

909
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I was catcher in gym class today.

910
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,000
That's great, neal.

911
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,500
Where's mom and dad?

912
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
In their room.

913
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Yeah, they've been in
there for over an hour.

914
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,900
Are they fighting?

915
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,900
No.

916
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh! Hi, sweetie!

917
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,800
Hi, mom.

918
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,800
Uh, i think we're gonna
order food in tonight,

919
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,800
So maybe you could call a pizza place

920
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,300
And have them deliver.

921
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Harold: JEAN!

922
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,300
Hey, dad...

923
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,300
Kim's here.

924
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,800
She gave me a ride home from school.

925
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,300
Hi, mr. Weir.

926
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Nice to see you, kim.

927
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,800
Thanks for giving lindsay a ride home.

928
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,900
Jean, could i have a word with you, please?

929
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,800
Yeah. Your father and i
are gonna be in our room,

930
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,300
So let us know when the food gets here.

931
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,800
You kids play nice now, you hear?

933
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh, my god.

934
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,500
