Freaks and Geeks S01E16 Smooching and Mooching (VO)

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
They got a lotta crap here, huh?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,900
No kidding.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,400
I think

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm gonna try to sell all my junk.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,100
You know, my crap is way
better than this crap.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,100
Look at all these books, man.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
Why do people save their books,

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,600
Like...read a book twice?

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
They're probably just
bragging to us, you know?

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
They're like, "ooh! Look at
all these books i've read.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm so clever! I read a
lot of books and stuff!"

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Oh...check it out, man!

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,100
They got bongos!

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Yep.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,100
We could play evil ways if we had these.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
Yeah, actually, that would bring

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,600
The andopolis drum kit to an even 30 pieces.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,600
31 pieces.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,100
All right. I'm gonna buy these, man.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
This garage sale rules.

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,100
Hey, man, listen, you gotta be quiet

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Ff at me.

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,600
Why?

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
Did he see your report card?

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,100
Yeah.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,100
No, i was playing american band

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,600
While he was watching 60 minutes.

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,600
Um...

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,600
Nick...where are your drums?

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
You had no right to give my drums away!

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,200
Those drums were making you go deaf.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,700
Otherwise, you would
have heard all the times

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,700
That i tried to tell
you to clean up your act.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,700
You know that i've been trying.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Fine. With a little more effort,

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,700
You could end up living in a cardboard box.

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,700
Those drums were my personal property.

57
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,100
Your only personal property is your future.

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Maybe the drums are my future!

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,600
Why don't you think about that?

60
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
End of conversation.

61
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,600
You owe me money.

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,300
Excuse me?

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,300
Those were my drums,

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,300
I paid for them, and you sold them,

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
And i want the money.

66
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,300
How much did you spend on drums

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,300
And how much did you spend on drugs?

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,300
Give me my money!

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,100
End of conversation.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Fine. You know what? i'm outta here,

71
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,600
And i hope that you enjoy
your peace and quiet.

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,400
There's something wrong with these cans!

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,400
He hates these cans!

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
The jerk is the perfect movie.

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
There isn't one scene in
it that isn't hilarious.

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Nope. caddyshack'sbetter.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,100
Way funnier.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,100
Ted knight is the funniest.

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Ooh, billy, billy, billy.

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,600
Ooh, billy, billy, billy! Huh?

81
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,100
No, no. That movie is so uneven.

82
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,100
I mean, yeah, half of it
rules, but half of it sucks.

83
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,100
It's just likestripes. You
could not tell me what happened

84
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
In the second half of the movie.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
They get reassigned to europe
to work on a top secret mission

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,100
Concerning the urban assault vehicle.

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,500
Then the stupid border
guys wouldn't let them in.

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,400
That's when, um
- um, sam?

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Can i talk to you for a second?

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Uh...

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Over here.

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh.

94
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Sam, i just broke up with todd.

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,800
Really?

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,300
Wow.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Um...i'm sorry.

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't be! todd's a jerk.

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,800
He's only interested in one thing.

100
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
All these jocks are.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
So anyways, i was wondering,

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,100
Are you gonna be home tonight?

104
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Yeah.

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Good.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,100
'Cause i'm gonna call you.

107
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,600
I really need someone to talk to.

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Ok. Uh...

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,600
And, you know, any time. Ha ha.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
My god!

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
It's happening!

112
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,500
You guys, where's my chair?

113
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Shallots?

114
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a potato.

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,000
They're shallots, right?

116
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey, is anybody using this chair?

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,500
No.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,500
You can have it.

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Really?

120
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,500
That's really nice of you.

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Grateful dead.

122
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,500
Music sucks. chicks are hot!

123
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah.

124
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Does anybody wanna give me a neck rub?

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Ha ha! God, nick!

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I can't believe you spent
the night on daniel's floor!

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
His carpet is, like, infested!

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,900
Better than sleeping in my maverick.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Kinda.

130
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,900
You gonna go home tonight?

131
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,300
No. Not as long as that fascist is there.

132
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Hey, ken, can i stay at
your house tonight, man?

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,600
No. My dad.

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
He'll have a conniption fit.

135
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,900
Thanks a lot, man.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,400
You know, he doesn't even
let my grandma stay over.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
He's got issues.

138
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Whatever, man. Thanks.

139
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,500
I'd invite you over again,
nick, but you blew it.

140
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,000
You gotta remember to flush the toilet!

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
My mom almost had a
heart attack this morning.

142
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Oh! nick: he's just joking.

143
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
I'm not joking!

144
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,400
Can you not talk about this now, please?

145
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I had to plunge-

146
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,900
Can you not talk about this now, please?

147
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
Definitely, i wanna stay at your place. No.

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I-you know what? No. no thanks.

149
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,900
Hey, lindsay, you think that maybe

150
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,100
I could, uh, stay at your place tonight?

151
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,100
God, nick, if it were
up to me...sure, but...

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,100
Come on, my dad? He's
way worse than ken's dad.

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah. No, don't
- no problem.

154
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
Nice try, though, nick.

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,900
Shut up, man.

156
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,400
What you should have done is
you should have pretended to cry.

157
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,000
You would have been in
if you pretended to cry.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dad, give me one good reason

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why there can't be a woman president.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,500
It's called 3 irrational days per month.

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,400
Now, i would have no
issue with the other 27,

162
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,300
But...we're talking about
the atomic bomb here!

163
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Oh, harold!

164
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Dad, that is so stupid!

165
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,200
You know, men get periods, too.

166
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,200
It has tdo with your body tides.

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,700
My body does not have a tide.

168
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Those religious people have
been bothering me all day.

169
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,200
Can't a man finish his supper

170
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Without those religious types bothering us?

171
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,800
Hey, uh, mr. Weir.

172
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
Is lindsay home?

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,800
She's eating dinner.

174
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
Oh, yeah. i can tell.

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
God, it smells really great in there.

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Let me guess.

177
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Meat?

178
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Congratulations.

179
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,200
Hey...nick.

180
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,700
What are you doing?

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,700
You know... Just came by to say hey.

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,200
I-i didn't realize that you guys
were gonna be eating so late.

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
You guys eat late.

184
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh! Hey, nick.

185
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Hey, mrs. Weir. Boy, i was just saying...

186
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,700
Your pot roast smells amazing.

187
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,100
Well, uh...would you like
to join us for dinner?

188
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
We've got plenty of food.

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I mean, sure,

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
If-yeah! that would rock!

191
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
I haven't eaten dinner yet!

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is it ok with you, mr. Weir?

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
It would...rock.

195
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,900
Mrs. Weir: COME ON.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,900
Oh, wow. this worked out well.

197
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,900
Oh, my god!

198
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Mrs. Weir...

199
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,400
This pot roast is unbelievable!

200
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,900
You're even a better cook than my mom.

201
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Oh, i'm sure she does fine.

202
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,900
You don't get to be as tall as you are

203
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Without somebody doing
something right nutritionally.

204
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, uh, so...

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Mr. Weir...

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You sell sleeping bags, right?

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah. Why, you going camping?

208
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
No.

209
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,000
I've just been spending a lot of my time

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
Sleeping on people's floors...

211
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Lately, so, you know, i thought
i should probably get a good bag.

212
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Why on eth are you
sleeping on people's floors?

213
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,600
My dad kicked me out of the house.

214
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,100
He didn't kick you out.

215
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
He sold my drums.

216
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,100
That doesn't really seem
like an invitation to stay.

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Now, wait a minute.

218
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,000
He didn't just sell your drums.

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
I mean, the man must have had a reason.

220
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah. He had a really stupid reason.

221
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
He said... that my drums

222
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Were interfering with my schoolwork.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think my schoolwork was
interfering with my drums.

224
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,600
Terrible.

225
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Why don't you spend the night over here?

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
On the couch.

227
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
What?

228
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Really?

229
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You mean it?

230
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah.

231
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh, my gosh.

232
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,900
My gosh. You guys e the nicest people.

233
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,500
Your whole family is... so nice!

234
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Thank you so much!

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,500
Oh...i

237
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
T's like you cooked this in heaven...

238
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Then brought it back
down here to your table.

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, stop!

241
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Bill, i need to talk to you for a second.

242
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
It's about yesterday.

243
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,800
That wasn't me. That was
neal. He just said it was me.

244
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
What?

245
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,700
Uh-noth-what?

246
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Anyway...

247
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,700
Sam and i had the greatest
conversation yesterday.

248
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,700
It just...lasted for hours!

249
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Look, i know i can trust you with this,

250
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,700
Because we're lab partners.

251
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I like sam.

252
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,200
Me, too.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,700
No, ilikelike sam.

254
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Oh.

255
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Oh!

256
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,700
I don't know.

257
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,900
It's like i never date nice guys.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,900
I should try it. I mean,
i think i deserve to.

259
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,800
So do you think he likes me?

260
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,800
It's hard to tell.

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,200
Well, do you think you can find out for me?

262
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,700
Ok.

263
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
And tell him to ask me to mona's party.

264
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,700
There he is.

265
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Thanks.

266
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,600
Everyone take their seats.

267
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
We've got a busy class ahead of us.

268
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,100
Bill! Psst! What just happened?

269
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,600
Cindy wanted me to find out if you li-

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Gentlemen, can we save the chitchat

271
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
For the cafeteria?

272
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Today we will be having a pop quiz.

273
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,700
Cindy-

274
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,700
Gentlemen!

275
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,700
Yes...mr. Hal?

276
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,800
All right, nick. this is what you gotta do.

277
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,300
Get her to stay up watching tv with you,
right, until her parents go to sleep.

278
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,800
Then you offer to give a back rub.

279
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
You do it right... you're in.

280
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,300
All right, look. Let's get
this straight, all right?

281
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Lindsay and i are just friends, ok?

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,700
And, anyways, i think it's
really cool of her parents

283
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
To let me stay at the
house. That's it, all right?

284
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,800
Ok, man. Just friends. I didn't realize.

285
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
I mean, you know, look, i-

286
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
If she came to me in the
middle of the night...

287
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,000
And was, like, you know,
"nick, i love you..."

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,800
I wouldn't turn her away.

289
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
Did he try to give you a back rub?

290
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
No.

291
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,700
Well, he will.

292
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
He if tries to give you
a foot massage...run.

293
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,800
Kim, what am i gonna do?

294
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,300
It's just too weird having him in my house!

295
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,800
You have to kick him out, lindsay!

296
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,300
No. I can't do that.

297
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
Well...

298
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,300
Then you're in for a long night.

299
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
I don't believe you.

300
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
It's true.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
If this is some kind of a joke...

302
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,500
And you're trying to set me up,

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll stop being your
friend. I'm not kidding.

304
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,900
It's true!

305
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Sam, you gotta ask her to that party!

306
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,400
I don't-i don't even know mona!

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,400
What's the difference?
it's what cindy wants!

308
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,600
I think she wants to be your girlfriend.

309
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh, man.

310
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,700
Neal: WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

311
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,700
You wanted this for years!
be a man! Go get her!

312
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Yeah, i know, but
- but what?

313
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
I'm scared!

314
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,100
Well, they're not.

315
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
I can hear what they're saying right now.

316
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
"Uh, hey, cindy,

317
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
You want to go with me to mona's party?"

318
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,100
"Well, i was kind of hoping

319
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
"That sam was gonna ask me,

320
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,600
"But since he doesn't seem interested,

321
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,100
Ok, thor."

322
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,600
Ok, ok, shut up.

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm gonna ask her.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Hey, cindy? Um...

325
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,600
Can i talk to you for a second?

326
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,800
Hey, sam.

327
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,300
Yeah, sure.

328
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,300
Hey, i'll see you guys later.

329
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,300
Ok, after french class?

330
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
Yeah. ok.

331
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,200
What's up?

332
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I was wondering...

333
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,200
Do you want to come to mona's party with me?

334
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,100
I'd love to.

335
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,100
Really?

336
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Really.

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,900
It's happening.

338
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,500
They're smiling.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,900
Going out withcindy,

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,900
And stops hanging out with us?

341
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
He won't.

342
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
He'll get us in with cindy's friends.

343
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,500
Like vicky.

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, man, i love her.

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Thought you said they were pod people?

346
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,000
A cult, you said.

347
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,000
They are.

348
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,000
But that's one cult i wouldn't mind joining.

349
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Bring on the pods.

350
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Uh, well i'll see you there.

351
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,800
Ok.

352
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,300
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

353
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,200
Yeah.

354
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,200
Call me?

355
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,200
Ok.

356
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,500
See ya!

357
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,900
It's on.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Nick.

359
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,400
It's quiet hour.

360
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,400
Am i being too loud? i'm sorry.

361
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,400
Shouldn't you be doing your homework?

362
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Me?

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,900
Um, yeah,

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,900
I mean, i was.

365
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,900
You were?

366
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
Then maybe you ought to finish it.

367
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,300
You're starting to sound
like my dad, mr. Weir.

368
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Oh, yeah?

369
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Well, then, your dad is a smart man.

370
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm a drummer, you know,

371
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
So, i mean, this is my homework.

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Oh, come on, nick.

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
This isn't homework.

374
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
This is screwing around.

375
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,300
Now, if you're really a drummer,

376
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Your homework would be
practicing your drums.

377
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,200
Well, i'd like to be practicing my drums,

378
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,200
You know? But my dad gave them away.

379
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,600
Well, then you go out and you find 2 sticks

380
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,100
And you pound on a rock.

381
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,500
Wanted to be a drummer

382
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Would do if someone took his drums from him.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,900
You know, when i was in high school,

384
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,800
I was working in a department store,

385
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
And learning all about retail,

386
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
And i still got straight as.

387
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,300
Now don't tell me you can't find time

388
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
To do both things.

389
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,800
You can't be that easy on yourself, nick.

390
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,300
Push yourself.

391
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,300
You're a smart kid.

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,700
That's really, um...

393
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
That's really cool of you to say, mr. Weir.

394
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,200
It's true.

395
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
Oh.

396
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
By the way, that drummer
you're listening to?

397
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah.

398
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,600
He's terrible.

399
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,100
That's neil peart.

400
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,600
He's the greatest drummer alive.

401
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, neil peart couldn't drum his way

402
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Out of a paper bag.

403
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
You want to hear drumming?

404
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,600
All right. Come on.

405
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I'll play you drumming.

406
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
That guy is amazing.

407
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,500
How did you hear about him?

408
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,500
Are you kidding? these guys?

409
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,500
I grew up with gene krupa and buddy rich.

410
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
Oh, god.

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
How do they do that?

412
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,000
They must hold the sticks like this.

413
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't do that.

414
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,500
I've never been able to do that.

415
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,500
You can go faster that way.

416
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,500
Oh!

417
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,500
God, how do you learn to do that?

418
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,500
I don't know.

419
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Maybe they took a lesson?

420
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh, my-that is insane.

421
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Nobody can do that.

422
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Maybe i should take a lesson, huh?

423
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Hey, lindsay, can i ask you something?

424
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,600
Hmm?

425
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah.

426
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
Cindy and i are going
to this party together,

427
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
And i think it's sort of like a date.

428
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Really?

429
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Yes.

430
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,900
She kissed me good-bye today in school,

431
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,400
And i didn't know what to do.

432
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,900
I just stood there.

433
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
She kissed you?

434
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah.

435
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,300
What if she wants

436
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,800
To kiss me at the party for real?

437
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,300
Yeah?

438
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Well, what if i do it wrong?

439
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,700
You can't kiss wrong.

440
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,700
You'll know what to do

441
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
When it happens.

442
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,700
It's just that...

443
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,300
I've never had a girlfriend before.

444
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,700
Just be yourself, sam.

445
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,700
That's

446
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Be a gentleman

447
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
And don't be weird

448
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,600
And don't smother her.

449
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
Nick was so into me,

450
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,100
He made me want to move
to a different country.

451
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh, my god.

452
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't think nick's in love with you.

453
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,200
I think he's in love with mom and d.

454
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,200
Oh, my god.

455
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,200
This is the best family, ever.

456
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,500
Who is it?

457
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Hey, it's Nick.

458
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,600

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,500
That youare letting me I think
it's rand your pstay here.

460
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,700
Go back to bed.

461
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,700
I really appreciate it.

462
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,200
You know?

463
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,500
I need you to know that.

464
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Know.

465
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Please just don't OK, good night.

466
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Good night.

467
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,700
Ng

468
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,400
Unh!

469
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Oh.

470
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Hey.

471
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,400
I was, uh, working.

472
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,300
Hey, um...

473
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Those are, uh, nice pajamas.

474
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,500
This is a whole new world.

475
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
I see double-dating

476
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,000
And triple-dating

477
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,500
And cheerleaders at your house

478
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
And me at your house.

479
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,500
Congratulations, sam.

480
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,000
I heard about your good fortune.

481
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,900
Thanks.

482
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
She's the one that should be thankful.

483
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,500
You're a catch.

484
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,500
So, can you get bill and i into this party?

485
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know. I haven't
really thought about it.

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, think about it.

487
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
I don't-i don't want to go.

488
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,600
Why not?

489
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,100
Everyone wantso go to a make-out party.

490
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,500
It's a make-out party?

491
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Uh-huh.

492
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,000
Nobody told me it was a make-out party.

493
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,500
Well, you better get ready to make out.

494
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,000
Otherwise she's gonna
think you don't like her.

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're not gonna french kiss cindy,

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Are you, sam?

497
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
French kissingi woul is gross.

498
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Dn't french kiss in a million years.

499
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And why the hell not?

500
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Hello.

501
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,900
Germs. Spit. Mucus. old bits of food.

502
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,400
That's just to name a couple.

503
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
There's a lot of things in there.

504
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,900
I mean, why do you have
to use your tongue, anyway?

505
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Aren't you supposed to kiss with your lips?

506
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Because it's not a real kiss

507
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Unless you use your tongue.

508
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,400
Why?

509
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
What's the point?

510
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
I mean, what are you supposed to do?

511
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,900
Lick the inside of her mouth?

512
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,400
Are

513
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
You supposed to lick her teeth?

514
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,400
Do you make your tongue hard or soft?

515
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
God, bill. Enough.

516
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
What? I want to know now,

517
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,900
Since everyone seems to think

518
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,300
That french kissing is so great.

519
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,300
Ok, bill.

520
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,800
You put your tongue

521
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Against her tongue.

522
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,800
What if she puts her tongue

523
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,400
Too far into my mouth? Wh-

524
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
What if i throw up?

525
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
What if i throw up all over her?

526
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
What if i throw up in her mouth?

527
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,300
Ugh, shut up, bill!

528
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,200
That's disgusting!

529
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,200
Sorry.

530
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,700
Well, i'm just telling you guys

531
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
I'm not doing it.

532
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,200
Well, i am,

533
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,700
As soon as possible.

534
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
What do you say, can we go?

535
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Well, if i take you,

536
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Then i have to take gordon and harris.

537
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,200
Guys, i can't make it.

538
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm saving my virginity

539
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,700
For the future mrs. Crisp.

540
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,700
Nah, i have a date with judith.

541
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Every night's a make-out party with us.

542
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes.

543
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,100
Whoopie.

544
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,600
All these make-out
parties start the same way-

545
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,100
Spin the bottle.

546
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,100
That's why this bottle is the
key to our make-out future.

547
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
He spin

548
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Will determine whether we have
a good night or a great night.

549
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
You can't control a bottle, neal.

550
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,700
Oh, can't i? just watch.

551
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,200
I've been practicing all week.

552
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,700
How'd you do that?

553
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,200
It's all finger control.

554
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
All you have to do is train yourself

555
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,700
To make the bottle spin 2 revolutions,

556
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Then you add or subtract a
small percentage of torque

557
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Based on the position of your target.

558
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
That's amazing!

559
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
All i can say is... hello, ladies!

560
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,100
What?

561
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,600
What if...they don't wanna kiss us?

562
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
That's the genius part
of the game. They have to!

563
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know. i just...i just

564
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,000
Don't wanna see the expression on their face

565
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
When they see that the bottle lands on me.

566
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Bill, who cares if they look disappointed?

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
All i care about is if they
look disappointed after the kiss.

568
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,500
But i know they won't with me,

Do people fren the bottle?

571
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Some do.

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
Most don't.

573
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,500
I do.

574
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I don't feel so good.

575
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,000

576
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,500

That's really, really where i'm goin' to

578
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,500

I got no kick against the west coast

585
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,900
Warner brothers are such good hosts

586
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,400
I raise my whiskey glass
and give 'em a toast

587
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,900
I'm sure they know it's true

588
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Here we go.

589
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,900

Your turtleneck. take offthat's my look.

I can't. I'm not wearing
anything underneath.

595
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,400
Besides, i happen to
look cool in a turtleneck.

596
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,400
So do i! Everyone looks cool in turtlenecks.

597
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,900
That's the point! We can't both wear them.

598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,900
We'll look like the smothers brothers.

599
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Tsh.

600
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm not goin' in topless.

601
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,300
Fine. i'll take mine off.

602
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,300
Nice dickey!

00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,800
Just-just don't embarrass me, ok?

608
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,300
What? Now that you're going out with cindy,

609
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,300
You're ashamed of us? don't embarrassme.

610
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Fine. Be that way. i don't care.

611
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,200
Hey, guys.

612
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,200
Hey, sam.

613
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,500
You, um... you look really good.

614
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,900
So do you, cindy.

615
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,700
You look beautiful.

616
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,200
Anks, sam. you're sweet.

617
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Come on.

618
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,000
Are you going in?

619
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,500
Don't rush me.

620
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Are you ok?

621
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,400
You remember that scene at
the beginning ofanimal house

622
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,400
Where flounder wants to
get into the fraternity,

623
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,000
But they don't think he's cool,

624
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So they put him in that room

625
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
With the blind guy and the indian guy?

626
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,500
About to be sent ike we'reinto that room.

627
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Blind guys are cool.

628
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,900
They have supersonic hearing.

629
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,900
You're right.

630
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Let's mingle.

631
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,300
So, did you kids have a good day today?

632
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,800
Uh...

633
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I don't know. it was ok.

634
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I had, like, the best day, mrs. Weir.

635
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,300
I took my first drum lesson ever.

636
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Oh, wow.

637
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,800
A drum lesson?

638
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Yeah.

639
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,300
Hey, how'd that go, nick?

640
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
It went so well, mr. Weir.

641
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
The drum teacher, terry breeze,

642
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
He's, like, the coolest guy.

643
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,300
He taught me how to hold
the drumsticks jazz style,

644
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Like this.

645
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Paradiddle, paradiddle, paradiddle.

646
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,200
Good.

647
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Nick, where did you get money

648
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,800
To take drum lessons?

649
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,100
Um, your dad.

650
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Yeah. Nick'sonna work part-time
as a stock boy at my store

651
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,100
To pay for his lessons.

652
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,000
Lesson good for you.

653
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,000
All right. I'll get the ham, and we'll eat.

654
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,000
Let me help you, mrs. Weir,
'cause hams can be heavy.

655
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,500
Jeez. Dad, that's really nice of you.

656
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,400
What do you mean?

657
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,000
I just mean

658
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
At you're playing records for nick

659
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,500
And giving him drum lessons

660
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
And letting him stay at the house.

661
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
That's...

662
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
What's the deal?

663
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,900
Well, i'm trying to help the kid out.

664
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,900
What, you don't want me to?

665
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,400
No, i'm just wondering why,

666
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
When nick has a problem,

667
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
You're nice and logical.

668
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
When i do, you just yell at me.

669
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
That's because i expect more from you.

670
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,900
Nick's father is a hard man.

671
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
My old man was the same way.

672
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,400
Yeah, i know the feeling.

673
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,900
Lindsay?

674
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,900
Trust me, you don't.

675
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Now, anytime you wanna
dance with me to gene krupa,

676
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll be around.

677
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,300
Oh, why does the bottle keep landing on me?

678
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,600
Hey, how come the bottle never lands on me?

679
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,600
Girl: OK. WHOSE SPIN?

680
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,900
That's 3 times.

681
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Now it's 7 minutes in heaven.

682
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll give you 81/2.

683
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,500
All right Cindy. Your spin.

684
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,400
Oh, yes!

685
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,900
Sam, i'm sorry.

686
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,900
Yeah, sorry, sam.

687
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,900
Come on, cindy.

688
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,400
Yes?

689
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Hello. i'm nick's father.

690
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,500
Oh. Well, i'm harold weir.

691
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's a pleasure meet you, sir.

692
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Come on in.

693
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Nick, it's time to come home.

694
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Ok.

695
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,600
Could i talk to you in
the kitchen for a minute?

696
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,600
Sure.

697
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,600
Look, i appreciate your
letting nick stay here.

698
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,100
Oh, it was our pleasure.

699
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
That's quite a kid you've got there.

700
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,600
Yeah.

701
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,100
So, uh...

702
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,100
You gave his drums away, huh?

703
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,600
I guess they may be pretty distracting.

704
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,600
You have no idea.

705
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,100
Eh, things kids will get into.

706
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
When i was a kid,

707
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,600
I was always bringing dogs home.

708
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,600
Uh-huh.

709
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,600
Well,

710
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,100
Teenagers will try all sorts of things.

711
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,600
Sometimes you just gotta let 'em be kids.

712
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,100
Harold, how old is your son?

713
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,500
14.

714
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,500
You call me when he turns 16.

715
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,500
Hello there.

716
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,200
Great. 2 more guys.

717
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Oh, god.

718
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,600
I lay my head on the railroad tracks

719
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm waitin' for the double "e"...

720
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
It's kind of on me a little.

721
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
No, it's not.

722
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Poor, poor, pitiful me

723
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh, of course.

724
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:02,200
Poor, poor, pitiful me

725
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,700
Thanks.

726
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,300
These young girls won't let me be

727
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,800
Lord, have mercy on me

728
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Woe is me

729
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Whoo!

730
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Ok, becky.

731
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, my god.

732
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
Just...quickly. Come on.

733
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,000
On the cheek.

734
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Oh! God!

735
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
This is ridiculous.

736
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
There is obviously something
wrong with that bottle.

737
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
It keeps landing on you, bill.

738
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Switch with her.

739
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
What ?

740
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,400
Ok.

741
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,100
Oh, woe is me

742
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,400
Ok. I'm spinning again.

743
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,400
No!

744
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Hey, just kiss him and get it over with.

746
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Your turn.

747
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,200
She took me back to the hyatt house

748
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
I don't wanna talk about it

749
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,200
Hey!

750
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,000
That's 3.

751
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,400
Vicki and bill are goin' in

752
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
For 7 minutes in heaven.

754
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,400

Poor, poor, pitiful me

Well, uh, thanks again.

I hope he wasn't too much trouble.

765
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,300
Oh, no. He wasn't any trouble at all.

766
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,800
I'll be out in the car.

Ok.

00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,300
Good night.

769
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,800
You guys sure you don't wanna adopt me?

770
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,800
You sure you're gonna be ok?

I mean, he came looking for me, right?

773
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,200
Didn't really think that was gonna happen.

774
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,700
Hey, stop by any time.

Every time i look at you,

You look like you're

Yeah. Yeah.

816
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,100
You're always laughing or something.

Hey, dad.

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,800
That was really nice what you did for nick.

822
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm sorry you think i don't
treat you right sometimes.

823
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,200
I didn't saythat,dad.

824
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,200

00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,700
Wish you could talk to
me like you talk to nick.

826
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,600
You know what the difference is

827
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,100
Between you and nick?

828
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
You're my daughter.

829
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,600
And...every second you're out of this house,

830
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,600
Every second that i can't see you

831
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,100
Or know what you're doing,

832
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,600
It's...

833
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,600
It's absolute torture for me.

834
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Dad, i can't stay inside all the time.

835
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,100
I know.

836
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,500
Why not?

837
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Good night, honey.

838
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,400
All right. good night, dad.

839
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,900
So all the cans behind steve
martin start springing holes,

840
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,400
And steve martin says, "there's
something wrong with these cans."

841
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
And he sees the guy shooting, and he says,

842
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
"That guy hates these cans."

843
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,100
It's really funny.

844
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
There's...

845
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,100
Somethin' you should know, babe

846
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,000

847
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,400
I've en you smilin'... what? What?

848
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,100

850
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,100

Someday, lady, you'll accompany me

852
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,200
Out where the rivers meet the soundin' sea

853
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,200
You're high abovee now, you're wild and free

854
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Ah, but someday, lady, you'll accompany me

855
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,600

Um...cindy, can i kiss you?

858
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,700
Of course.

859
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,200
Some people say that love's a losin' game

860
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,200
You start with fire, but you lose the flame

861
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
The ashes smolder, but the warm's soon gone

862
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
You end up cold and lonely...

863
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,700
Oh! hold on one second.

864
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,200
I'll take my chances, babe

865
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,700
I'll risk it all

866
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,000
I'll win your love

867
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,800

868
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,300
Bill, your 7 minutes were up 5 minutes ago.

869
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,700

870
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
Someday, lady, you'll accompany me

871
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,400
