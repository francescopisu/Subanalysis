00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,900
Freaks and Geeks S01E17 The Little Things (VO)

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,300
Sergeant pepper, where's the rest
of the lonely hearts club band?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,800
Lindsay, is this bonehead a friend of yours?

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,000
I like sam.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Oh.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,900
Do you think that there's any
chance that this may actually happen?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,900
You really like her, don't you?

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
So, if they open this new sporting
goods mega-store at the mall,

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,900
We're in for a real fight.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,400
Well, if i were them,
i'd be the nervous ones.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,300
I wouldn't shop at that big
mega-store if you paid me.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,800
Oh, i like this girl.
isn't she great, lindsay?

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,200
Uh, yeah, she's...great.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,100
So i hear something very exciting
is happening this week at school.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,600
That's right. Vice president
george herbert walker bush

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,100
Is coming to our school to speak
at an assembly in the cafeteria.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
Boy, i wish there was a way i uld get
the vice president to stop at my store.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,100
You can't pay for that kind of publicity.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,500
You know, the most exciting
thing is cindy, because she's head

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,500
Of the young republicans
club, gets to introduce him.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Wow, that is a big honor, isn't it lindsay?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Yeah, if you're a republican.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh, and you're not?

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,800
No, i'm a democrat.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,800
You know, everyone's a democrat
till they get a little money.

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,300
Then they come to their senses.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Note!

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,300
It looks pretty good.

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,000
What, are the blues brothers
doing a show in town tonight?

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No. George bush

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Is coming to speak to the school.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
The porn star?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The vice president of the united
states of america. George bush.

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, guys.

53
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,800
Hey.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
What's wrong?

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,300
I'm just
- i'm a little nervous.

56
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
I just found out we have to play

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Hail to the chief when bush
arrives. There's a lot of tuba.

58
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Don't worry about it, amy. Bush probably
doesn't know anything about the tuba.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,200
I can see it now.

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Stop!

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,600
All right, you guys. Come on, beat it.
there's no hanging out under the stairs.

62
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,100
What? Since when?

63
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
Since the vice president is coming.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come on, gimme a break. The secret
service wants all these areas cleared out.

65
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,600
How we ever gonna plan our coup?

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,500
Don't even joke, desario. I can get
you thrown in jail just for saying that.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,900
Come on, let's go.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Coooooup. Coup. Coup.

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,900
Don't joke about it.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,900
It's ok. I have to practice, anyway.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,900
Want to hang out after school?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,900
I don't know. I have to
practice. Gotta study.

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
You're a bad influence.

74
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
So i'll see you at 6:30?

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
See ya later.

76
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Bye.

77
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,200
I hope the game is good tonight.

78
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,700
Definitly.

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,700
It will be. Trust me. ha ha ha.

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Hey, guys. what's happening?

81
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,200
We don't know.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,200
All going on over there.

83
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,000
Once you start down that dark path,

84
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,000
Forever will it dominate your destiny.

85
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,800
At least that's what yoda always says.

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,300
I mean, not all cheerleaders
have to be pretty,

87
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,800
But their cheerleaders
aren't even remotely pretty.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I mean, they're dirty.

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,300
You know what it is? it's disrespectful.

90
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
It's disrespectful to their team.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,500
It's disrespectful to their school.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
If i was their student
body, i wouldn't allow it.

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey, not all our cheerleaders are pretty.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,900
You can say that again.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,900
Todd, shut up.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,900
I wasn't talking about you.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400
God, would you get over yourself?

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,900
Sam, you're not gonna defend me?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What? He-he said he
wasn't talking about you.

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,000
So you're just gonna let it go?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Would you stop?

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
I like sam.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,500
What, do you want to see us fight?

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I'd like to see that.

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Mousetrap! I win!

106
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Congratula

107
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,300
Tions, bill. Maybe you can
get the school to start a team.

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Funny.

109
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Sam, don't worry. it's just a game.

110
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,700
I mean, i'm good at mousetrap,
and you're really good at kerplunk.

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
No. No, no, no. it's not that.

112
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
It's just this thing with cindy.

113
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Shs kinda
- she's kinda boring.

114
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Really?

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,600
It's weird hanging out with her friends.

116
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,500
I mean, all she ever wants
to do is make out and stuff.

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,000
I'd kill to be that bored.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Maybe you're not doing this right.

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
I mean, aren't you supposed
to go out on dates and stuff?

120
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Well, y-yeah. we went to the mall twice,

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
And we went to this football game once,

122
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,400
And after that, we went to a different mall.

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,400
That sounds fantastic.

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,100
Maybe you should take her out on a date

125
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
And do something thatyouwant to do.

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,600
But what if she doesn't
want to do what i want to do?

127
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Then why are you going out with her?

128
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Because she's a goddess !

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,600
Am i the last sane man on
this godforsaken planet?

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey, pass her over here. I'dmoveto
the mall if she wanted me to.

131
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,100
All right. I'll ask. just shut up already.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,300
So how come we never hang out at your house?

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,800
Um, 'cause i hate it there?

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Rely?

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,300
Yes, really.

136
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,800
How come everyone always
thinks i'm joking all the time?

137
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Something to do with my voice,
isn't it? That's what i think.

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,300
I mean, your parents seem so nice.

139
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Well, they're not bad people.

140
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,700
They're good at their jobs.

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,200
I guess-i guess raising me

142
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Wasn't one of the things
they learned to do in college.

143
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,300
So how'd you turn out am i?

144
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,300
I don't know. I was, uh,
i was raised by a nanny.

145
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Yeah. Catherine.

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
She was pretty
- she was pretty great, you know.

147
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,800
She was the best mommy money could buy.

148
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,900
I di

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm glad you told me.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,900
Yeah. Well.

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,600
You know, i thinthat we
tell each other everything.

152
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,600
It's really important, so you gotta
promise me yeah. Ofyou won't freak out.

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,300
Oh, i'm pretty hard to freak out.

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,300
No, i'm serious. you promise?

155
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,800
I can try to promise.

156
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,300
If you killed someone or something, though-

157
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,800
No. You know, forget it.

158
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm sorry. Go on.

159
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,900
N.

160
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,900
But when i was born...

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Male or female

162
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah. Me, too.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, i mean-i mean, i was born with both...

164
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,500
With both male and female parts.

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
My parents made a decision with the doctors

166
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,500
Thank god, because that's who i am.

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,400
But it's still a really
big part of my life...

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,600
And i thought you should know.

169
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600
No, this is...good that you told me this.

170
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Are you freaking out?

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,800
It-

172
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,300
You're-you're, uh, you're all girl now.

173
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Yeah.

174
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Yeah. So, you know, it's ok, you know?

175
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,300
It's, uh, if i was dating
you when you were just born,

176
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Things, uh, might be a little different

177
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,300
'Cause of all that stuff.

178
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,300
But now you're, uh, you're
all girl now, so it's...ok.

179
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,900
Thanks, ken.

180
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,400
Yeah. You know, it's, uh, i, uh,

181
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I had my appendix out, so,
you know, i've been there.

182
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Ha ha ha ha.

183
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,700
Lindsay, old jeff rosso
is about to make your day.

184
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,700
You've heard of a guy named vice
president george bush, haven't you?

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

186
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,500
Well, i've arranged r you
to ask him the first question

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,500
During the informal q and
a with the student body.

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't want to do that.

189
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,000
Why?

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,400
Because i'm a democrat.

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,400
So?

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,400
So i wouldn't have voted for
reagan if i was old enough.

193
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
Why would i want to talk to his lackey?

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Gee, i don't know.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,400
Maybe because he's the second
most powerful man on earth.

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,900
Maybe because we live in a country where
we can actually question our leaders

197
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Without fear of being
hacked to death by a machete.

198
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,300
Mr. Rosso, i didn't-

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Hey, you know what? forget it.

200
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't want you to talk
to the vice president.

201
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,800
There's plenty of people here who
actually care about their country.

202
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,300
I guess me and my hippie friends
were all just wasting our time

203
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,300
At berkeley demonstrating
and stopping an unjust war.

204
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
Probably shouldn't have bothered.

205
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,300
Ok, mr. Rosso. Stop.

206
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,800
Come on, lindsay. I was
so excited foryouto do it!

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,700
You're a special person,
and it's your destiny,

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,800
If you like it or not, to be
interacting with world leaders.

209
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,300
Do you really believe that?

210
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
You bet i do.

211
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,800
Ok. Fine. I'll do it.

212
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I've got the best job in the world!

213
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,200
12 grand a year, and i'm overpaid.

214
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,200
Excuse me, sir. I'm gonna have
to ask you and this young lady

215
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,200
To please leave the office.

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,700
No, sir. W there anything wrong?

217
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,200
E just need to inspect
and cordon off these areas

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,700
Until after the vice president's visit.

219
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
But, uh, where am i supposed to work?

220
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,700
Sorry, sir, it's not my problem.

221
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,500
Thanks very much. isn't this exciting?

222
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Thank you. Do me a favor? Give
me a room sweep on the left side.

223
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Yeah.

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Uh, crockpot, you're going
to get a visual on that bogie.

225
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
He's coming at you.

226
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,500
He's about 6'3", a real dr.
feelgood look. Check him out.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
Wow. It's sixth period already.

228
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,000
Yep.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you have a good lunch?

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I thought the cafeteria food

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Looked a little gross, so i had an apple.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was actually pretty good.
if you like salisbury steak.

233
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Um... i have to get to math, so-

234
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I got chemistry.

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,100
Give you a call.

236
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,100
So what should i ask?

237
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,600
Well, ask him something
really tough, you know?

238
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,100
Put him on the spot. What
would he not want to talk about?

239
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
They say that reagan had iran
delay the release of the hostages

240
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,100
Until ter he was elected.

241
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,600
You should ask him about
that. write that one down.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,500
I bet he flips.

243
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,500
I want to ask him about
trickle-down economics.

244
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,500
Oh, lindsay, that's boring.
nobody wants to hear about that.

245
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,500
Here, give me this notebook. kim...

246
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to ask him about
the aliens at roswell.

247
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
Come on.

248
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I gotta write down some real questions.

249
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,900
Ok.

250
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,400
How's it going?

251
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Great. I think i

252
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,900
'M gonna get a "b" in math. I'm so relieved.

253
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,800
Cindy, i was kinda thinking that maybe

254
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,800
You'd like to go out on a date
with me. Like a real date, you know?

255
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,400
Sam, you're so sweet.

256
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,900
Of course i'll go out on a date with you.

257
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,800
Yeah?

258
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,800
Hey, you know what we could
do? All the football players

259
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,800
Are going to these batting cages,
like this goofy golf type place,

260
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,800
And then afterwards, they're
gonna go swim in this lake.

261
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,300
Doesn't that sound like fun?

262
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah. Well, actually, you know...

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was thinking that maybe
i could plan the date.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'd take you out. It would be my
surprise. It would be on me, you know?

265
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,400
I get it. You want to take your
girlfriend out like a real gentleman.

266
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,900
Yeah.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,400
You know what? I think
that's really romantic.

268
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Cool.

269
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,300
I can't take this anymore.
why are you acting like this?

270
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Acting like what?

271
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,700
You can't even look at me!

272
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm looking at you.

273
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,700
What are you thinking about what i told you?

274
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,700
Nothing. You know, you told
me, and i'm fine with it.

275
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,200
You're not fine with it!

276
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,200
You're acting completely weird.

277
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Well, i don't think i am.

278
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,100
I mean, how am i supposed to act
after you tell me something like that?

279
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know, but you're
not reacting at all.

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,800
I don't know what to say.

281
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,300
There's nothing i can
do. i-i can't change it.

282
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,100
You're such a jerk.

283
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Amy, tell me what to say,

284
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
'Cause clearly you have something in mind.

285
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you still like me?

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah! Of course i like you still.

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
And you can live with this?

288
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Live with what? It's over.
i mean, you know, move on.

289
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Ken, you don't understand.
it's not that easy.

290
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
No matter what the doctors did,

291
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,500
There's always gonna be
some part of me that's...

292
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,500
A guy?

293
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,500
No. Forget it.

294
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,500
If it were me, i'd take
her to a broadway show.

295
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Broadway? we're in michigan.

296
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Dinner theater?

297
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
The jerkis playing at the discount theater.

298
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,000
That's not exactly romantic.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
Laughter is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

300
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Get a woman laughing and
you've got a woman loving.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,000
You gotta get her a really good present.

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You could make her something.
like out of paper mache.

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,500
Yeah, that's great. it's from the heart.

304
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,900
Hey, harris? What kind of
presents do you get judith?

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,400
Judith has very particular tastes.

306
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,900
About the only thing she ever wants

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,900
Is scented oils and plenty
of time with her man.

309
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,900
I have the perfect gift.

310
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
What is it?

311
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,400
Your grandmother gave this to me

312
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
When i was just about cindy's age.

313
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,400
It's an heirloom.

314
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,300
I thought it was the most
elegant thing i'd ever seen,

315
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
And i'm sure if your grandmother knew

316
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,200
How important this was to you,
she would want you to have it.

317
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,200
And i want you to have it.

318
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,700
After all, this is your first love.

319
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Thanks, mom.

320
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,700
Wit

321
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Right for each other.

322
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,100
I a perfect couple.

323
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,900
Ok, look, i'm going to
tell you guys something now,

324
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,500
D you have to promise no

325
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And not to tell anyone ever, ok?

326
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Amy's not really a girl.

327
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,900
But she's kinda-she's i mean, you
know,she is-kinda part guy, too.

328
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,900
What's that mean?

329
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
It means thatshe was packing
both a gun and the holster.

330
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,500
L have,you know...the gun?

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No. The doctors took care of it.

332
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,100
I don't think it works that way.

333
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Youbetter get rid of her.

334
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,200
To break up with her. nti really like her.

335
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I might even...love her.

336
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Realyeah. Yeah.

337
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,700
I don't know. Does it?

338
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,700
S

339
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
To my new "office,"

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,900
Courtesy of big brother.

341
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,400
It's kind of cramped. sorry about that.

342
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Quite all right.

343
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,900
All right. Ken miller. here. Talkin'.

344
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
What can i do for you?

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,900
Um, i, uh, can't believe it myself,

346
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
But i actually came here
to ask you some advice.

347
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, that's what they pay me for.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah. Um...

349
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,100
Well, there's a small little chance that...

350
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,600
I might be gay.

351
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,600
I see. That's cool.

352
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,600
And, you know, i thought
you'd be a good person

353
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,100
To talk to about it, since you're gay.

354
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm not gay.

355
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
You're not?

356
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,200
No.

357
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh. Man. i just always thought-

358
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,000
Why did you think that?

359
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,500
I-i don't know.

360
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
You just-you kinda have this way about you,

361
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,500
And i've-i've never seen you with a woman.

362
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,800
I don't bring dates to school.

363
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Look, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

364
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,700
It's just not my personal preference.

365
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,700
I think i'd better get going.

366
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,600
Ken, you can stay and talk about this.

367
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,600
No, i don't think i can.

368
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
There's a brand-new dance,
but i don't know its name

369
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
That people from bad-

370
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,300
If they could see me
now that old gang of mine

371
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,800
I'm eatin' fancy chow
and drinkin' fancy wine

372
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I'd like those stumblebums to see for a fact

373
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,300
The kind of top-drawer,
first-rate chums i attract

374
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,300
All i can say is, wow,
hey, look at where i am

375
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm landing, pow, right in a pot of jam

376
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,600
What a setup, holy cow

377
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,600
Believe it

378
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,600
If my friends could see me

379
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,100
Friends could see me

380
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,700
Said if my friends could seme

381
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
Come on. Come on.

382
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,400
No! Damn it! come on!

383
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Mother-

384
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Mr. Rosso?

385
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Lindsay.

386
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
What are you doing?

387
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,700
I locked my keys in my car.

388
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,800
You need some help?

389
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,900
I think i can handle it.

390
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
Bu oh...

391
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,900
Sh's people...rejected your questions.
so they've written one for you. Here.

392
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,900
"What is your favorite place to
eat in the state of michigan?"

393
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,400
What the-what happened?

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,700
The bush people found the ones
you wrote too "sophisticated."

395
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,500
Sophisticated? what does that mean?

396
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
That's code for "nice try, but this
is a glorified photo opportunity."

397
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Look, i'm disappointed, too, ok?

398
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
But let's try and keep a positive
perspective on all this, ok?

399
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
You actually get to interact

400
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
With the vice president of the
united states. That's historic.

401
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Ooh. Maybe if i'm lucky, he'll tell me

402
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Which steakhouse has the best prime rib.

403
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Don't you think I'm P.O.'d, too ?

404
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I thought we were gonna have an
actual political conversation.

405
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,100
You can't win with these people.

406
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,600
You know what all my protesting
accomplished in the sixties at berkeley?

407
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,600
16 scars on my head
from a tear-gas canister.

408
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,600
We tried to get 'em to stop the war. They
stopped the war when they felt like it.

409
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,100
And now all my compatriots are
gettin' rich working wall street,

410
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,600
And i can't get my keys
out of my mother's car.

411
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,600
What, that's it? You're just gonna give up?

412
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,100
Come on. There's nothing we can do?

413
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
No, there's something we can do.

414
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,100
You can go get brooksie the janitor
to come out here and help me.

415
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,000
So i told todd that
republicans aren't...selfish.

416
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,000
It's just that they don't believe
poor people should get handouts.

417
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,500
I mean, they should get jobs.

418
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,100
Handouts just make them
lazy, don't you think?

419
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Uh, i don't know. i guess so.

420
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Well, they do.

421
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Todd never understood. He's a
democrat. They like handouts.

422
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Um, and speaking of handouts, ha ha,

423
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,100
Uh, i got you something.

424
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Really? Sam, you're the best boyfriend.

425
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,500
What'd you get me?

426
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
What is it?

427
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,500
It's an heirloom necklace.

428
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,000
It's been in our family for generations.

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
How much did it cost?

430
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Um, i don't know. it's an heirloom.

431
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, thank you. that's very sweet.

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Well, do you want me to put it on you?

433
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,900
No, that's ok.

434
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,900
You know, it's metal, so it'd be
cold on my neck and everything.

435
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Isn't that stupid? They're
afraid of real questions.

436
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,900
He's not coming to your high
school to be interrogated

437
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,400
By a bunch of pimple-faced teenagers.

438
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
You have to be polite to the man.

439
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Oh, so, what-if you have a zit, you're
not entitled to an opinion? Is that it?

440
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
I just think it's nice he's coming.

441
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,800
I mean, i'm sure he's a very busy man.

442
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,800
Mom, busy doing what? Waiting for the
president to die so he can take over?

443
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Lindsay.

444
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,300
Look, thers a more important opportunity

445
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
To be had here.

446
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I was thinking... When you ask your
question, you can mention my store.

447
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Dad, that's sick.

448
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,800
Would be sickif we went out of business.

449
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Your only affiliation right now
to any party is to the weir party.

450
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
We need help.

451
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,700
Mom, tell him to stop, please.

452
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
No, honey, this is serious.

453
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,200
Those mega-stores can offer
discounts your father can't.

454
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,600
This is no big deal. all
you have to do is say,

455
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,600
"Hi, i'm lindsay weir. My father owns
a-1 sporting goods out on 16 mile,"

456
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,100
And then, "what's your favorite
place to eat in michigan?"

457
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
I can't believe you're asking me to do that.

458
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,500
Oh, and maybe you could wear

459
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,500
One of the store's new
t-shirts. Show her, honey.

460
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,500
He hates these cans!

461
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,500
Stay away from the cans!

462
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,500
Ha ha ha ha!

463
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,900
Ha ha ha!

464
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
More cans!

465
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Ha ha ha ha ha!

466
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
Isn't this great?

467
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Ye

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,900
Do you want somepopcorn or something?

469
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,900
Will popcorn make

470
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Is no. I think it's stupid.

471
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,200
Old is this guy?

472
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
He's got gray hair, and he's
running around like a 5-year-old.

473
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,900
What?

474
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,000
M?

475
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,600
Yeah?

476
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,600
What are you-

477
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Ow!

478
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,100
What are you doing?

479
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm giving you something.

480
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,100
Oh, god, what are you giving me?

481
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,100
I'm giving you a hickey, you goof.

482
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Oh, my god! I'm endangering your life!

483
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,100
Cover me!

484
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,100
No you're covered!

485
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
, You guys, really, rosso's cool.

486
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,700
Did you ever really look at him?

487
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,300
He's actually kind of good-looking.

488
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah, if you're attracted
to guys that look like jesus.

489
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,300
Shut up!

490
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,200
Hey.

491
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
Hey, what's up?

492
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,700
Hey, guys.

493
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
What's that supposed to mean, daniel?

494
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,700
Ng, guys?

495
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh, jee that.

496
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
What the hell, ken?!

497
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Take it easy, man.

498
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,100
Oh, my god.

499
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,600
Hey, Daniel you're ok ?

500
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,600
Yeah, i'm all right.

501
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,100
Are you guys gonna tell us

502
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,600
What the hell that was all about?

503
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,100
Just forget it, kim.

504
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,000
Daniel, he just punched you in the face!

505
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,000
Give it a rest, ok?

506
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,900
Amy.

507
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,900
Can you just please let me explain?

508
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
Hey.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,500
You ok?

510
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah.

511
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,500
Are you? you look weird.

512
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
Huh?

513
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,000
My best friends were punching
each other in the face tonight.

514
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Cindy and me went to seethe jerk,

515
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,500
And she didn't laugh once.

516
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,100
Uh-oh.

517
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,100
I mean, she's so pretty.

518
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,600
How come i don't like her?

519
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,100
M, just 'causea girl's pretty

520
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,100

521
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah, i know.

522
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,700
Well, don't worry about it.

523
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,700
If it doesn't feel right,

524
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,300
You can always break up with her.

525
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,400
T br

526
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Why nowhy?

527
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,100
Well, because they cat believe that...

528
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,100
She's going out with me in the first place.

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Sam, you can't just if you donand-

530
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Ec

531
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Man, sam.

532
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
What?

533
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,700
Let me see it.

534
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,700
You better wear a turtleneck

535
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,700
Before mom and dad see that.

536
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,400
Highways and dance halls

537
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,500
A good song takes you far

538
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
You write about the moon

539
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,600
And you dream about the stars

540
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Blues and old motel rooms

541
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,700
Tricia, nice blouse.

542
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Red, white, and blue looks good on you.

543
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,000
Good morning, miss.

544
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Wow!

545
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,500
Mr. Rosso, you look really good.

546
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,500
Yeah, i clean up nice,
if i do say so myself.

547
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,500
So, you ready?

548
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, i guess.

549
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Are you?

550
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah. That whole thing in the parking lot,

551
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That was crazy. that was inappropriate.

552
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But we shouldn't get so worked up about it.

553
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,500
Let's just have fun. the
vice president is here!

554
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,500
This is exciting, isn't it?

555
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,500
Hey.

556
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
So,

557
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,900
You really gonna do it?

558
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm a member of the weir party.

559
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Ha ha ha ha!

560
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
My stomach hurts.

561
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Yeah, my stomach would hurt, too,

562
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
If i was breaking up with
the prettiest girl in school.

563
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,300
I'm glad your stomach hurts.

564
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,300
Know what that is? It's
your body telling you

565
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,300
You're making a big mistake.

566
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,300
No, neal, i'm not making a mistake, ok?

567
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,800
Just because a girl's pretty
doesn't mean that she's cool.

568
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,300
Ok, sam,

569
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,800
First of all, of course it does.

570
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,500
And secondly, you're just scared.

571
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
I mean, years from now you're
gonna be sitting in your house,

572
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Looking at your unattractive kids

573
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
With your unattractive
wife, saying to yourself,

574
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
"Man, why did i ever dump
that goddess cindy sanders?"

575
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You know what? I can't
listen to any more of this.

576
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
Have i ever told you about the time

577
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,300
That i made out with vicki appleby?

578
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,800
Oh, shut up.

579
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,300
You're such a liar.

580
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,300
Hey, amy.

581
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,800
Whoa, wait up!

582
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,300
Is everything ok?

583
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,800
No. I can'

584
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,300
T even believe i came to school today.

585
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,700
Well, what's going on?

586
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,700
Like you don't know, lindsay.

587
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,700
No, i don't.

588
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
You mean ken didn't tell you?

589
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,200
Nobody'll tell me anything.

590
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,700
Do you want to talk to me?

591
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,100
Maybe i could help you.

592
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,600
You know, lindsay, don't worry about it.

593
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
I'll see you later.

594
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,100
Hey, amy!

595
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Good luck with hail to the chief!

596
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,600
Thanks.

597
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Hey.

598
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,500
Are you lindsay's brother?

599
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,200
Sam. Yeah.

600
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
Did you just puke?

601
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
No. I'm nervous.

602
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,200
Because of george bush?

603
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm gonna break up with cindy sanders.

604
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Wow. Why, man?

605
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,700
She's hot.

606
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,200
You know, she's just
really different than i am.

607
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Yeah. I-i know how that one goes.

608
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,700
I've been thinking i have to
break up with my girlfriend, too.

609
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,700
Oh, how come?

610
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,200
It's complicated.

611
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,200
Very complicated.

612
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,200
It's just we don't have anything in common.

613
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,700
I mean, she thought the jerkwas stupid.

614
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
You serious?

615
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,200
Man, my girlfriend lovedthe jerk.

616
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,200
Anything to talk about.

617
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,200
She doesn't like anything that i like.

618
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
We never have any fun together.

619
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,700
That's too bad, man.

620
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Really, my-my girlfriend's pretty
cool when it comes to stuff like that.

621
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,700
God, then what's the problem?

622
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I don't know.

623
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,100
Well, i'm gonna break up with cindy sanders.

624
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Good luck, buddy.

625
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,600
Thanks.

626
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,500
Sam, i've be looking all over-

627
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
What the hell is that?

628
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,400
What?

629
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,900
Sam, you're wearing a turtleneck.

630
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,400
Are you covering up my hickey?

631
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,200
What? No!
No, i-i-

632
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,200
It's kind of embarrassing.

633
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
Come on, don't get all mad.

634
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,400
Oh, thanks, sam.

635
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
So i guess if you got me a diamond ring

636
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,900
And i didn't wear it because
i was too embarrassed,

637
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
You wouldn't get all mad, either?

638
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,800
Hey, come on! i got you a necklace,

639
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,300
And you've never worn it.

640
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,300
It was ugly!

641
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,500
It was an heirloom.

642
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,000
Sam, do not start a fight
with me right now, ok?

643
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,000
I have to go in there and introduce bush.

644
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Cindy...

645
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,300
What?

646
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't want to be your boyfriend anymore.

647
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I just want to go back to being friends.

648
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
Friends?

649
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
Why would you just want to be my friend?

650
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
I just really want to be your friend,

651
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,900
Like before.

652
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,100
No.

653
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,400
No?

654
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
No, sam, you can't break up with me.

655
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,200
You're supposed to be nice.

656
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
That's the only reason
why i'm going out with you

657
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,800
In the first place.

658
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Hey, i am nice!

659
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm just not having any fun. Are you?

660
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,200
No.

661
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
No, i'm not having any fun, sam.

662
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Have your stupid heirloom back.

663
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Um, you did the right thing.

664
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
You're too good for her.

665
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Are you gonna eat with us at lunch today?

666
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Thank god.

668
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Let's go.

669
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,500
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,500
And i don't care, and i'm so sorry.

671
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I have to get to the assembly.

672
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Ok.

673
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,900
All right, everyone just
eat like you'd normally eat.

674
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Hello, my name's rosso.
it'll be on your list.

675
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,800

676
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Sir, cou yes.

677
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,400
Ld you step over here for a second?

678
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,100
Sir, are you now or have you ever been

679
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
A member of an org

00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Anization called the taft students
alliance for a new america?

681
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,600
I no.

682
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Mean, i might be on their mailing list

683
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Somewhere from way back,

684
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,100
But i'm certainly not-

685
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,600
Well, unfortunately, you've been
red-flagged as a security risk.

686
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I can't allow you to attend the assembly.

687
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,500
There must be a mistake. i work here.

688
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,500
Yeah, i know.

689
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,000
Ok, now, i'm just gonna have to escort you

690
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,000
To a little holding area that
we've established over here.

691
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, wait, there he is!

692
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,500
Mr. Rosso, thank you so much

693
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,900
For getting lindsay this opportunity.

694
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,900
What's going on ?

695
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Where are you going?

696
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,800
I guess i rocked the boat
a little bit in my youth.

697
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,400
Don't worry about it, lindsay.

698
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Just go in there and make the school proud.

699
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Mr. Rosso, please.

700
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Step back. Step away.

702
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,300
See, i told you that guy was a kook.

703
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,800
So what do you teach here?

704
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,300
Actually, i'm a guidance counselor.

705
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,800
Really?

706
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Sometimes i have to just stand in one place

707
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,500
For 12 hours and stare at a wall.

708
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,000
You start to see things.

709
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Your feet
- the pain

710
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Well, it's an important job.

711
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,900
You ever no, it's not.

712
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Heard of the vice president
getting assassinated?

713
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
No. You know why?

714
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,400
It's never happened.

715
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,900
Will it ever happen? no way.

716
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,400
Because who cares?

717
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Know what i mean?

718
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

719
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,200
As the republican national
committee student liaison

721
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
I am honored to present to you...

722
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
The vice president of the
united states of america,

723
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,500
George bush.

724
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,300
Yeah, hail to the chief!

725
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,400
This song rocks!

726
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,900
You know, sometimes- i
mean, this sounds crazy-

727
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,900
But sometimes i think i just
want to rip off my vest and jacket

728
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,400
And just put on a t-shirt

729
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,900
And go and, like, make
pancakes somewhere or something.

730
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
But, i mean, that would be crazy, right?

731
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,800
Hey... i've got a test

732
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Which reveals what type of
job you're best suited for.

733
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,200
You want to take it?

734
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,200
Thanks, jeff.

735
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,200
Uh, now we're going to open up the floor

736
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
So the vice president
can take some questions

737
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,200
From our student body.

738
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,200
And our first question
comes from ms. Lindsay weir.

739
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Ms. Weir, go right ahead.

740
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Mr. Vice president, my name is lindsay weir.

741
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,600
My dad owns a1 sporting
goods on 16 mile road.

742
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,800
My question is...

743
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,300
Why did your staff reject my question?

744
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,300
Are you afraid of an open
discourse with the students?

745
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,500
Funny kid.

746
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,500
one of mckinley's finest.

747
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,000
"Do you like working with major appliances?"

748
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That'd be a yes.
