2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,280
Remember...

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,560
Nevra, wrap the case up for me.

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
Mehmet Yurtgil, Naimhan Turedi...

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,840
The last victim's name was Salih Guden.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,360
Three victims. Scratch Tufan.
Two of them are from Kambura.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
You've lived in Kambura for a while.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
So all this does have
something to do with Kambura.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
-It's Nazif!
-Nazif?

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Do you know Agah Beyoglu?

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
The biggest favor you can do
for such a sociopath is to talk about him.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,240
The one you chased all the way here...
You never saw his face?

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Someone threw a torch at the house.
It flared up...

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
and burned the house down.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
You're talking too much...

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
Something might happen to you.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,760
Is it supposed to be a rabbit?

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
No. It's a cat.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,480
-Agah, you tired?
-No, no, I'm fine.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,840
I know it was quite a walk,
but these sprout only in the morning.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,720
You almost missed me.
I was just about to leave.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,120
It was really surprising,
seeing you standing there.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
You haven't changed a bit.
You look great.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
-Neither have you, Seyfi.
-Except for getting older, that is.

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,360
Agah, when I'm your age, I hope to be...

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Look over there!

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
There it is.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,720
See this mushroom?

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
This is a death cap.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
One bite and you're dead.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
It's that poisonous.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Agah, what is that?
What are you doing?

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,600
Where is Umut, Seyfi?

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,920
-The small intestine. It belongs...
-There.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
Yes, there.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Where is Umut?

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
-The large intestine.
-The large intestine.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,720
The large intestine.
It belongs there.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
-Where's Umut?
-Fuck you!

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,000
You've heard about astrology, right?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
It's a ridiculous idea.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
Where's Umut?

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,600
You can't figure out someone's personality
from their birth date.

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
Let alone their future...

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
From their birth date? Impossible.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
You know what works, though?

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,440
Their birth place.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Where you're born
dictates your personality and your future.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Astrology should take
birth places into account.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,640
Predictions made on birth places
would be more plausible.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
In the end, children born in Tripoli,

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
Peshawar, or Angola

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,240
will live pretty much identical lives.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,560
And then there's Toronto, Oslo, Tokyo.

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Those children, as well.

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Our rural people
are well aware of this fact.

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
That's why...

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,640
This goes there.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,280
They never ask someone they meet
for the first time what their sign is.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,680
They ask them where they're from.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,160
I won't ask you again.
Will you talk?

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Will you talk?

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
Wait.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
Speak into this.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Speak into this, you got that?

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,120
Speak into this.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
And then there's the rising sign.

68
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,000
That corresponds to your citizenship.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
What country you're born in.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
That's important, as well.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,760
A Syrian boy born in Syria
does not share the same fate

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
with a French boy born in Syria.

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
My sign is Aleppo.
My rising sign is French.

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
That changes things.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Or...

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,920
My sign is Congo.
My rising sign is Belgium.

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
It changes things.

78
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,000
And my sign is Kambura.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
So is my destiny.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
Whatever I've made of myself,
I owe it all to being born in Kambura.

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,840
Go on.

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
Join your friends.

83
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,600
There's someone on the loose.

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
He's killed my brothers.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,400
He's shot my people from Kambura.

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,680
He's out there as we speak.

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,760
And here you are, just standing there.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,080
You're going to find him.
Not to arrest him, Firuz.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
He is not to stand trial.

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,080
You will bring
that son of a bitch to me, Firuz.

91
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll hold his trial,

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
and I'll pass his judgement.

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,520
-Is this a bad time, Cemil?
-Come on in, Zuhal.

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,480
You have a meeting with

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
our Middle Eastern representatives
in half an hour.

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
We should get back to the office.

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,280
What's your sign, Zuhal?

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Capricorn.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,440
But I don't really believe in signs.

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,680
See? She doesn't believe in them, either.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
Get back to work, and keep me posted.

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
What's your sign?

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,760
Dragon.

104
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
Come visit us again soon, Tolga.

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,880
I'd love that.
Thank you for your hospitality.

106
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
Goodbye.

107
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,680
My mom's lying.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,160
She didn't seem like she was lying.

109
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,280
Her husband obviously has some problems.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,280
Might he have dreamt it all up?

111
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,840
He might have.

112
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Sir...

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
You must have realized
that my mom and I aren't very close.

114
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
In fact, sometimes,
I start doubting that I know her at all.

115
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,080
But believe me,
I can tell when she's lying.

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
Here's what we're going to do:
I need to get back to the bureau.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,400
Drop me off at the local precinct.
I'll get a car there and go back.

118
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Call Sefa and call him over.

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Talk to the locals,
see if anyone remembers the fire.

120
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,720
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

121
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
Nevra...

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
If you don't come up with
any leads about the fire today,

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you're going to drop it. Alright?

124
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,400
Neither of us has any time to waste.
Is that clear?

125
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,720
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Good. Drop me off, and get some rest
while you're waiting for Sefa.

127
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't need that.
You haven't slept, either.

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
I got a good night's sleep
sometime last year.

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's go. Drop me off.

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
Say you're sorry first.

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,720
Suveyda,

132
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
I said some...

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
stupid things about you.

134
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Tell her exactly what you said.

135
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
I told people you were a whore.

136
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Alright? Are we good?

138
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
Tell her why.

139
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
I can tell her.

140
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
Because he asked you a question.

141
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
He wanted to be lovers.

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,960
But you didn't even give him a reply.

143
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
That made Afsin really mad.

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,720
Because he's so dumb he doesn't realize
that you've given up talking.

145
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
Hand it over.

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,680
-I don't have it on me.
-Where, then?

147
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,280
Come with me.

148
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,920
Selim, go ahead to the car.
I'll be right there.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right there.

150
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,680
Out for a ride, boys?

151
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,480
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing. Just standing here.

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
Oh,

153
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
Vural, you'd know what to do.

154
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,560
I have a gun.

155
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
A really old one.

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Where can I take it to be repaired?

157
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
Why do you have a gun?

158
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,120
-I don't know. I just do.
-What use would you have for it?

159
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
I want to chase away the flies.

160
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,760
Why would flies flee from a gun?

161
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
You do this.

162
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,160
Nesrin,

163
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,880
pointing a gun and shooting it
are two very different things.

164
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
I've pointed a gun at someone
only once in my life.

165
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
It was my ex-husband.

166
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
And I pulled my trigger.

167
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,240
But this is really old.
It doesn't work, anyway.

168
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
I can show you. See?

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,680
It worked.

170
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Pity. I shot your tyre.

171
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,280
Better the tyre
than one of you, though, right?

172
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
Alright, then.

173
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,160
By the way, Ufuk...

174
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
Ask your mom over to my place for tea.
Don't forget to tell her.

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
What have you done, Nesrin?

176
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Don't you realize how dangerous they are?

177
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,680
Besides, where did you get that gun?

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
I went...

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
and talked to Sungur the pimp.

180
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,840
I paid for it, too. So what?

181
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
You want me to just sit and watch
while they threaten my husband?

182
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
The real question is...

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Where did you find that stone, Selim?

184
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
It was really dark.
Did you have to look long for it?

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,640
Or did you scramble to find it,
to get a stone in yourself?

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
Was that how it went?

187
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,360
If you really did that,

188
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,680
then you're more dangerous
than they are, Selim.

189
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Step aside.

190
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Still no visitors.

191
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
They must've forgotten about me.

192
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Don't be silly.

193
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
Your daughter calls every day.
She'd never forget about you.

194
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
The shuttle was launched.

195
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,960
The shuttle was launched
but still no visitors.

196
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,120
They must've forgotten me here.

197
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,720
The shuttle was launched.

198
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,640
Come on.

199
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,840
-Weren't you scared?
-Just watch.

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
See the bloodstain?

201
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,840
The aquarium was busted, as well.

202
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,760
Suveyda. Come here.

203
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,320
Isn't that Mehmet Yurtgil?

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Point it at me.

205
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,800
That's it.

206
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
What did you do next?

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,640
What do you think?

208
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,480
No way.

209
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,200
Right then and there?

210
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
Don't get too excited.
We didn't record it.

211
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,000
Shit.

212
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,720
Here you go.
You can watch the rest of it later.

213
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,360
You won't find
the footage in there anywhere else.

214
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
We went to all the crime scenes.

215
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,520
So? Did you find any clues?

216
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,440
About who the guy might be, I mean.

217
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
-That's not the point.
-What is it, then?

218
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
Suveyda, show him.

219
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Nevra's cat.

220
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
Cat cat psychopath.

221
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
What is this?

222
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Welcome to the fan club
of Turkey's first legit serial killer.

223
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,120
We had to find a nickname for the guy.
Like Jack the Ripper.

224
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,240
We wanted to find a nickname
related to the stickers.

225
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,400
-We decided to start calling him Stick.
-Stick.

226
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,080
That's good.

227
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,000
We wanted to call him Writer at first,
but we decided it would be silly.

228
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,800
Then I thought about the cat costume.

229
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,560
This is what we came up with.

230
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,880
-What are you doing?
-Hold on.

231
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
DOG SLAYER

232
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,680
-Here it is!
-Holy fuck!

233
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,720
That's a great name!

234
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,440
Suveyda didn't like it at all first.
Killing dogs doesn't appeal to her.

235
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,840
But I explained to her that
it had nothing to do with dogs.

236
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,560
We all love dogs, right?

237
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,840
But that's not the point.
This is something else.

238
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
He's a cat.
A cat that kills dogs.

239
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
The weak triumphing over the strong.

240
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,000
It goes against everything we know.
It goes against nature.

241
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,840
I think that's awesome.

242
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
-I see.
-We're almost there.

243
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Just some finishing touches
on the website and we go live.

244
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
What's missing?

245
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,880
A forum asking a question:
Whom would you like Dog Slayer to kill?

246
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,800
People will share on the forum
whom they wish death on,

247
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
and why they deserve to die.

248
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
They will even vote on
each other's victims.

249
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,000
A list will emerge.

250
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Like a stock exchange
but for prospective murder victims.

251
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
That's rad.

252
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Imagine Dog Slayer
actually killing someone from that list.

253
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
Why not?

254
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,320
-Hold on. I'm almost done.
-Sure.

255
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,160
-Take the chair over there.
-I'm fine standing.

256
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Have you ever heard about
the village of Durucay?

257
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
I worked
at the courthouse there for a while.

258
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,720
One day, our superiors told us
we had to go to a mandatory seminar.

259
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,960
Some Americans came
and made a deal with the ministry.

260
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
They were the ones holding the seminar.

261
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
Anyway...

262
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,280
I was working as a court clerk then.
It's the most important job there.

263
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
You have to write
each and every word down,

264
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
never missing a single one.

265
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
-I'll wash up and be right back.
-What? Sure, sure.

266
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
So we went to the seminar.

267
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
They gave us these...

268
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
These masks.

269
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,520
Stenomasks, they were called.

270
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,200
You speak into it. It's so sound-proofed
that no one can hear what you're saying.

271
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,680
It's connected to a recorder
that records everything you say.

272
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
Anyway...

273
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,280
So they gave me one
and I started using it.

274
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,040
It was such a weird feeling,
speaking and not having anyone hear you.

275
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,000
It was so impressive that
I started seeing it in my dreams.

276
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
For instance...

277
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,120
I'm in a crowded place in the dream.

278
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,040
I speak and speak but no one can hear.

279
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,400
You know what happened a few days ago?

280
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,920
I was waiting in line at the bank
when a woman came to warn me.

281
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
She told me I was speaking to myself.

282
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,080
I was pretty shook up.
Who knows what I'd told her.

283
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,720
-Would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.

284
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
It's funny how things change.

285
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,440
I used to be terrified
that no one would hear what I said.

286
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Now, I'm terrified that they might.

287
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
I guess...

288
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,440
That's life.

289
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
What's wrong with your car?

290
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,960
My car's fine.

291
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm the one with the problem.

292
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
What have I done?

293
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
I forgot to ask him where Ufuk lived.

294
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
How am I supposed to find him now?

295
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Hello?

296
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,800
Hello? How do you answer this?

297
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,280
Hello?

298
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
Hello? Ufuk?

299
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
How do you answer this?

300
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
Hello? Ufuk?

301
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
You were so good at this stuff, Mebrure.

302
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,320
You were so good at answering the phone
and talking to the caller.

303
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
I asked you to teach me how but
you kept putting it off. Now look at me!

304
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,760
You went and left me,
and here I am, all alone!

305
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
What am I supposed to do now?
Whom am I supposed to ask for help?

306
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,200
Am I supposed to ask them
how to answer a phone?

307
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
Won't they mock me?

308
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,400
An adult man
who can't even answer a phone!

309
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
See what you did?
I'm over here talking to myself!

310
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,360
He can't do anything!
He can't even answer a phone!

311
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,360
I wouldn't be talking to myself
if you were here.

312
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,680
That's what the woman at the bank said.
I was talking to myself.

313
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,720
Yes, but no one will hear what I'm saying.

314
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
You don't hear what I'm saying.

315
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
You don't hear!

316
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,480
No one listens!
No one listens to me!

317
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,360
No one!

318
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

319
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,320
-Have you been waiting long?
-No. I just got here.

320
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,800
Take me to the house.

321
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
UFUK
EXPECTING YOU FOR DINNER IN KAMBURA

322
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
You do hear me.

323
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,760
You should've wished for something bigger.

324
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,560
Just this morning, you said
you wanted to see Kambura again,

325
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,400
and here we are, on our way there.

326
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
You're right.

327
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,400
When you asked me to cancel
all your meetings, I was concerned.

328
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,960
-Everything's alright, right?
-Of course. Everything's alright.

329
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
I want to see an old friend.

330
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,200
We should have some fish.
Our fish is unlike anywhere else's.

331
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,520
And some raki, as well.

332
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
You do drink, right?

333
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,080
It doesn't really agree with me.

334
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
One glass of raki never hurt anyone.

335
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
I've seen much more
implausible reports before.

336
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Reports declaring that
a man shot from behind had killed himself.

337
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,280
-Welcome to Kambura.
-It's a nice place.

338
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
Like a fairy tale.
Why don't you like it?

339
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Here are the red riding hoods,
and there are the wolves.

340
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,360
And mandatory happy endings
no matter what comes to pass.

341
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
It's a fairy tale, alright.
We just need to find the narrator.

342
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,240
Selim or whomever
it was that wrote that report.

343
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
Ufuk!

344
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Ufuk, come and help me!

345
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Ufuk, I'm talking to you!

346
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,800
-Let me finish my smoke.
-Put it out!

347
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Have you lost your mind!
What are you doing!

348
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
What's one more scar?

349
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,480
Ufuk! Ufuk!
Where are you going, son?

350
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,120
Has it been like this for ten years?
Why don't they tear it down?

351
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
I think they're so used to seeing it that
they don't even notice it anymore.

352
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,920
You can't tear down something
you don't notice.

353
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,800
The people lost in the fire...

354
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,760
Tayyar Kaymak, 49.
His wife, Songul Kaymak, 41.

355
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
And their five children.

356
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,440
Seven people,
all living in this tiny house?

357
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
I read something in a novel once.

358
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
"Man takes less and less space
the poorer he gets," it said.

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,520
The poorer you are,
the smaller you can make yourself.

360
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,040
So that's why the richer people get,
the more space they need.

361
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,280
Explains the gigantic houses.

362
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
How old was the youngest child?

363
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Four months old.

364
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
Four months old.

365
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,080
In such a tiny house.

366
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,520
Could you go to sleep
when you have a four-month-old here?

367
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,680
I don't remember what I did
as a four-month-old.

368
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,640
I'll tell you what you did.
You cried nonstop.

369
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,240
So how come the report says

370
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,880
that they were presumed to have
slept through the fire?

371
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
All of them.

372
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
How's that possible?
All seven of them, asleep.

373
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,800
I already told you.

374
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
Whatever's in the report goes.

375
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,360
Tayyar Kaymak had some priors, right?

376
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Yes. Jailed twice,
both times for burglary.

377
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
Burglary...

378
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
If you were a thief...

379
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
would you be living in this place
with six other people

380
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
while also working the fields?

381
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
Never.

382
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,720
I might start working the fields
if I'd repented for my sins, though.

383
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,120
Tayyar wasn't a thief.

384
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,160
Not a single one of the people
who died in this house was a thief.

385
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
-So...
-Ufuk.

386
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,400
Alright, Ufuk.

387
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,360
Where were you burnt?

388
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
I was burnt here, as well.

389
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
I was trying to save them.

390
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
Who started the fire?

391
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,520
I did.

392
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,040
I was standing right there.

393
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,000
Everything flared up in an instant.
I was startled.

394
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,720
I thought they'd get out of the house
after seeing the flames.

395
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
But no one get out.
The fire was getting bigger.

396
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,440
I could hear the screaming
children inside.

397
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,400
I could hear the children's screams!

398
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,800
I ran to the door,
but the door was chained and locked.

399
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
I tried to break the chains,
but I couldn't.

400
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,680
I ran to the other window.
It was shut, as well.

401
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,160
I thought maybe...

402
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,600
I couldn't get anyone out!

403
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
I shouted to the crowd!
Help me, I said!

404
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,920
Let's break the chains together!
Somebody help me!

405
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,680
Nobody helped!
Nobody broke the chains!

406
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,200
Nobody came!
Nobody helped me!

407
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,840
-Then...
-Ufuk!

408
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
Ufuk!

409
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,320
-Ufuk.
-What?

410
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
Who chained the doors?

411
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,160
I asked them who did.
They told me there were no chains.

412
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
I was supposedly...

413
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,040
I was burnt while
trying to rescue the family.

414
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,880
A falling beam hit me on the head.

415
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,440
Ufuk, here's what we're going to do.

416
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
-Ufuk, we're going...
-Arrest me!

417
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
-Sure, alright.
-Arrest me!

418
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
-Come with me.
-Arrest me!

419
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
-Sure. Fine.
-I killed those children. Arrest me!

420
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
-Sure.
-Please!

421
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,800
-Let's talk for a bit.
-My face was burnt here!

422
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,360
-Sure, come with me.
-Arrest me, please arrest me!

423
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
-Sure, I will.
-Arrest me! See my scars?

424
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
-Sure.
-I burnt the house down!

425
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
-I understand.
-I killed those children.

426
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
-Alright, alright.
-Please arrest me.

427
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,480
Look at that house!
I'm the one who burnt it down!

428
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,160
-I understand.
-The children! I burnt it all down!

429
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
-The boy's talking.
-Leave him be.

430
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Let him talk.

431
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,920
-You still haven't gotten married?
-No.

432
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
Of course.

433
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,760
You already have a wife, right?

434
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,160
-Kambura.
-That's right.

435
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Why did you call me here, Cemil?

436
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
What do you want from me?

437
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
What are you doing with that gun?

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Blowing out tyres.

439
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,240
I heard.

440
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
I heard it all the way in Istanbul.

441
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I'm sure it did.

442
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,120
Selim will be alright, Nesrin.

443
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
No one's going to hurt him.

444
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
All we ask...

445
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,480
-Is that his imaginary remorse...
-Imaginary?

446
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,480
Exactly.

447
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,400
He should keep it to himself.

448
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,960
Quietly.

449
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Let's say
you successfully shut Selim up.

450
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,800
What will you do with Ufuk?

451
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
How will you shut that poor boy up?

452
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,960
Why would I shut him up?

453
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
He's talking as we speak.

454
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
Talking to whom, you may ask.

455
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,040
He's talking to that
beautiful daughter of yours.

456
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
Nevra doesn't realize that
Ufuk is a troubled man.

457
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,000
For years now, he's confessed to arson
to every cop he ran across.

458
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
You should let Nevra know
the next time you see her.

459
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
He is a certified loon.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

460
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,440
Don't you ever wonder
what really happened?

461
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,440
-About?
-The truth.

462
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,360
No.

463
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,880
So you don't want to know.

464
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm loyal to my wife, Nesrin.

465
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,600
You know what true loyalty is?

466
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Never questioning.

467
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,520
In other words, deceiving yourself.

468
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
Have you ever...

469
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
loved anyone so much that
you'd never question anything?

470
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
Have you ever...

471
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
believed in something no matter what?

472
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
Of course not. Never.

473
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
I guess...

474
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,400
you must've never had a family, Nesrin.

475
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,960
KAMBURA POLICE DEPARTMENT

476
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,760
You didn't cuff me.

477
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,120
-You promised you'd arrest me.
-Don't you realize the state he's in?

478
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Let us talk to him and we will.

479
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,040
Thank you for all your help.

480
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
Tell it from the beginning.

481
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,280
-I already did.
-Tell it again.

482
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
How many times do I need to tell it?

483
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,320
I thought you were proper cops.
I burnt the house down!

484
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,120
I killed all those people!
What else is there to say?

485
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,440
It seems you won't do your job, either.

486
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm not telling you anything.

487
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,120
I'll keep telling it to myself.

488
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm so sick of this.
I'm so sick of it.

489
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,480
I can do it myself.
I don't need you.

490
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Where do you think you're going?

491
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,320
Where do you think you're going!

492
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,240
You're just standing there.
You haven't even put me in cuffs!

493
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Fuck you and your cuffs!

494
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,200
You there! Look here!
Come here! Quick!

495
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,800
Give me that!

496
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,240
Hold out your hands!
Hold them out!

497
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,600
There you go!
There's your cuffs!

498
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
Let me talk to him alone.

499
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
Are you sure?

500
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll be right outside.
Yell if you need anything.

501
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,280
You were the one
I was chasing that night, right?

502
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
Why did you
want me to see it, Ufuk?

503
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,520
Why did you want the truth to come out
after all these years?

504
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,360
After all these years?

505
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,560
I've been imploring the cops
ever since the incident.

506
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Telling them that I did it.
That they should arrest me.

507
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,840
I've been shouting it
from the rooftops for ten years.

508
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
But no one will listen.

509
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Then they leave.

510
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,760
Others take their place.

511
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,640
I tell them.
They don't listen, either.

512
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,280
I heard Nesrin's daughter
had become a cop.

513
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
I thought that maybe...

514
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Maybe she'd listen to me.

515
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
But how was I supposed to find you?

516
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,280
Then, one day,
you appeared in Kambura.

517
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
Do you have any trash, Naz?

518
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
Your door's unlocked.

519
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,400
Naz?

520
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
Are you home? It's Seyit.

521
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Who else was there with you
on the night of the fire?

522
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,600
I don't remember.

523
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,280
But everyone was there.
I'm sure of it.

524
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Alright.

525
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
If Tayyar Kaymak never stole anything,

526
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,120
why did that crowd gather outside
his house, aiming to kill him?

527
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
Why else?

528
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,840
Because they were gypsies.

529
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,480
Because they were gypsies?

530
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,920
You're telling me that all those people,
all those children...

531
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,240
They were killed
because they were Romani?

532
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,080
-That's the only reason?
-Yes. It's enough.

533
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,560
How do you know that?
Who told you?

534
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
Nobody told me.

535
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,360
Nobody told me, because...

536
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,600
I remember it all too well.

537
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,080
I don't remember
exactly who was there.

538
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,520
But I remember very well...

539
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,000
what I said, what I shouted out
as I was throwing that torch.

540
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,920
What were you saying, Ufuk?

541
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,760
"Fuck off out of Kambura!"

542
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,880
"Get out, you filthy gypsies!"

543
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,920
I TOLD NEVRA EVERYTHING
BUT SHE WON'T BELIEVE ME.

544
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,520
Our beautiful apartment
is going to be all over the news.

545
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,080
You demon. You're going to
bring misfortune upon us.

546
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,200
The newspaper told me

547
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,160
that I'd be getting paid for the tip.
How much you think I'll get?

548
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,440
I'll give you the money.

549
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,360
Maybe he had a special friend.
Maybe he did it.

550
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,120
You think she was selling herself?
What do you think?

551
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
I doubt she was selling herself.

552
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,080
Unlike you.

553
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,080
Don't be like that.
Go on, leave.

554
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,320
-Let him go!
-Let the poor boy go!

555
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Do you want us
to come and get him?

556
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,160
-Huh?
-My son!

557
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
My son! Don't be scared.
I won't leave you in there!

558
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,400
I won't let anyone hurt you!

559
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,120
Let me go!

560
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,320
He's certified! Certified,
I'm telling you! My son is sick!

561
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
Let him go! Son! Ufuk!

562
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
Ufuk!

563
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,240
He's certified!

564
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,040
He really is certified.

565
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,840
States that he's in poor mental health.
He can't be held liable.

566
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,920
I tried telling you,
but you wouldn't listen.

567
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
DIAGNOSIS: IN POOR MENTAL HEALTH

568
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,040
Sefa, listen to me carefully.

569
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,480
Keep your wits about you,
and stay in the building.

570
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
I've sent you back-up.
They'll be there soon.

571
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,560
They'll get both you
and the suspect out of there.

572
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,920
What?

573
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,240
I take all responsibility.
Just bring the guy to me.

574
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,520
-Go!
-Understood, sir.

575
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,280
I think I've had enough.

576
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,840
Come on.
You've had only one glass.

577
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,040
Besides, it's really hard
to drink too much in Kambura.

578
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
How was the meeting?

579
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,640
-What?
-How was your meeting?

580
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,120
Oh. Good, it was good.

581
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,240
I met an old acquaintance,
from back when your father was here.

582
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,440
Funny.

583
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,960
You might know my father
better than I do.

584
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,760
What do you want?

585
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
Excuse me.

586
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,520
Yes?

587
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
What?

588
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
Taking him to Istanbul?

589
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,640
Don't let them take him away.
I don't care how.

590
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
Don't disappoint me.

591
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Got it?

592
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
Everyone might know my father
better than I do.

593
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,320
Yes...

594
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,640
Let him go!
Let my son go!

595
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,600
Take him away!
Take him away right now!

596
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,720
Feza? It's your turn.

597
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Go on.

598
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
She has a beautiful voice.
Wait 'til you hear it.

599
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,920
Go on, Feza.
They're all listening.

600
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,120
Here you go, Feza.

601
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,480
My head is foamy cloud.

602
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,560
My head is foamy cloud.

603
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,880
My inside and outside is a sea.

604
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,360
I'm a walnut tree in Gulhane Park.

605
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,280
An old walnut tree.
With long branches and pieces.

606
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,440
Neither you are aware of this

607
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,040
nor is the police.

608
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
Whenever I recite that poem,

609
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
I feel as I'm traveling into space.

610
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,520
If you won't do it,

611
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
then I'll do it myself.

612
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,480
I'll do it myself, alright.
I'll show all of you.

613
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,240
What's he doing in there?

614
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,560
What's he up to?

615
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,680
Ufuk!

616
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,520
Ufuk, come on!

617
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,680
Shit.

618
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,280
Shit!

619
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
Shit!

620
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,040
Shit, shit, shit!

621
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,280
What are you doing,
just standing there, you dumbass?

622
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,960
Attention all units, I repeat:

623
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
The suspect is 1.79 tall
and weighs 70 kilos.

624
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,760
He has distinctive burn marks on his face.
His name is Ufuk Terazi.

625
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,760
-Clear.
-Where could he have run to?

626
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
-Check his home.
-Where?

627
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,400
We should check his home.

628
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
What's going on here?

629
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,120
We don't have time for this.

630
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,000
What's going on here?
What's going on?

631
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,120
Get out of our way.

632
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
-What do they want?
-They want the kid, sir.

633
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,560
Hello there.

634
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,280
-Stay back. Don't come any closer.
-Sure, I won't.

635
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
It all ends here.

636
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,440
You can't change my mind.
I'm going to do it.

637
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,720
-I won't interfere. As you were.
-Who are you?

638
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,120
-I'm just going to need the knife back.
-What knife?

639
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,120
-It was you?
-Yes.

640
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,360
-How did you know I'd be there?
-I'm from Kambura, after all.

641
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We all know about that place.
Escapers Central, you might call it.

642
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,640
Tevfik made his jailbreak there.

643
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,480
Everybody knows about it.
They used to tell it like a fairy tale.

644
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,960
They must've told it to you, as well, huh?

645
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,960
I've never seen you before.

646
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,760
Are you from Kambura?

647
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,800
In actual fact,
Tevfik had that place built.

648
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,800
When he heard
he was going to be transported

649
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,840
to a prison in Istanbul,
he called his men.

650
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,360
Told them to construct
a public bathroom on the highway.

651
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640
He'd ask the cops to stop there
and run out the window.

652
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,680
The Can, they used to call it.

653
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,680
The Can.

654
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,680
Escape Central, as it later became known.

655
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
How many years it must've been...

656
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,480
What do you want from me?
Why did you help me?

657
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,040
You texted your brother Umut telling him
you were going to kill yourself.

658
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,160
What was that you said?

659
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,800
"The woman cop is back in Kambura.

660
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120
I'm going to tell them everything.

661
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,480
Either they jail me
or I kill myself."

662
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,840
-How do you know about my text to Umut?
-So I... Let me speak.

663
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Let me speak.
I'm trying to tell you a story.

664
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,640
I saw them taking you away.
I saw the crowd outside,

665
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,000
telling them to let you go,
telling them you're certified.

666
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,160
I decided to wait in Escape Central.
You never know, right?

667
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,240
How do you know about my text to Umut?

668
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,960
Where is he?
Is Umut here as well?

669
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,040
No, son. Umut isn't here.

670
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,000
-He's the one who sent you.
-You could say that.

671
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,600
-So you know Umut?
-Do I know him? Of course!

672
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,440
I know Umut. I know Seyfi.

673
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,600
All of Kambura knows you.

674
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,400
Everybody used to love you.

675
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,120
"Look at the triplets!" they'd say.

676
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,840
I don't want to keep you much longer.
Please get back to what you were doing.

677
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,000
I'll just be standing here.

678
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,480
-Can I have the knife back, please?
-Take it.

679
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,000
Thank you very much.

680
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,560
He isn't here! Clear the road!

681
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,840
Clear the road! Ufuk ran away!

682
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
Clear the road so we can find him!

683
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,960
We aren't going anywhere.

684
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,480
We aren't going anywhere without Ufuk.
Where is he?

685
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,000
He's in the car, I know it!
Let's overwhelm them and get him!

686
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,920
Let's go.

687
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,560
Are they launching
fireworks or something?

688
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,560
-Would you like some help, son?
-Don't come any closer. Stay right there.

689
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,800
It's funny.

690
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,520
I went to see a play the other day.

691
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,760
There was a scene that resembled this.

692
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,400
Not exactly, but close.

693
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,440
I didn't find it believable at first,

694
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,080
but I think they might've had a point.

695
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,560
They said that
conscience resembles the gut.

696
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,480
And the gut resembles conscience.

697
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,320
If you want it emptied,
you have to be the one to do it.

698
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
Funny. See...

699
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,120
I prepared this for you.

700
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,480
To stick on your forehead.

701
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,120
But since
you're going to be the one to do it,

702
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,840
I wouldn't want to disrespect you.

703
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,920
I wouldn't want to get
between you and your conscience.

704
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,320
That's why I won't.

705
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,080
Go on.

706
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,600
I wonder which of us is the crazier one.
Leave me alone.

707
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,720
-Would you like some help?
-Stay right there!

708
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,920
Sure. But don't tarry.

709
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,040
The cops are looking for you.
They might be here soon.

710
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,280
Make it quick.
Raise yourself. Just like this, see?

711
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,480
Not like that.
Get on your tippy-toes.

712
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
That's it!

713
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,280
Let yourself go!

714
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,840
Kill yourself and be done with it.
No more pangs of conscience, Ufuk.

715
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,440
Go on, don't be scared.

716
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,120
Go on!

717
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,520
Where are you?

718
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,320
It's funny.

719
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,400
This is exactly how I taught
my daughter to swim.

720
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,960
We were in Erdek.

721
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,920
She was on the pontoon.
I was in the water.

722
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,720
I kept telling her to jump.

723
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,560
She refused to do it.

724
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,400
I told her I was right there,
there was nothing to be scared of.

725
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,400
Come on, come to papa.

726
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,800
Let yourself go.

727
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,920
Come on in.

728
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,040
That's it!
That was some jump.

729
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
Zuhal wouldn't jump.

730
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,920
She just froze.

731
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,080
My little girl wouldn't trust her father.

732
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,040
She was wise beyond her years.

733
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,000
DOG SLAYER
