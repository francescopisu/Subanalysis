<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,202
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,363
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,880
LOVE

17
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,926
YAGAMI

18
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>If you're interested,
come here immediately.</i>

19
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,265
Okay, Dad.

20
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,395
<i>Just as I was thinking about
how to get in...</i>

21
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,772
<i>I never thought L himself
would ask me.</i>

22
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>Now I can get inside information
about the investigation...</i>

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,653
<i>and about the fake Kira.</i>

24
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,489
<i>I need to ﬁnd out about Fake Kira</i>

25
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>before anyone else at
task force headquarters does...</i>

26
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,538
Thank you, Yagami.

27
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,081
Not at all.

28
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,709
Ryuga, we both want to catch Kira.

29
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,545
Please call me Ryuzaki here.

30
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,547
I'm Matsui.

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,632
I'm Aihara.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,383
And I'm Asahi...

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,844
I see.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,722
Well, would it be all right if
I'm Light Asahi?

35
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,518
Please do. I will call you Light here.

36
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,896
Now onto business.

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,815
Please take a look at
our current information on Kira.

38
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,109
I also want you to examine this video,
which was sent to the television station...

39
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,695
but was never released to the public.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,450
Taking any material from this room
or taking notes is forbidden.

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
I understand.

42
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,411
We shall now begin.

43
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,041
Light...

44
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,753
THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

45
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,718
and ask Light Yagami
to investigate with us.

46
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,263
B- But wouldn't that make it difficult
for Light to help with the investigation?

47
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,975
That's right. Why do you want him
to work with us anyway?

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,311
We're only going
to hide that from him...

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,607
until we have him watch this tape
and ask him for his impression of it.

50
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,069
There's something amazing
about Light's reasoning skills.

51
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,737
When he sees this,

52
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,366
he may even deduce that
there is a second Kira.

53
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,745
But the only basis for
a second Kira is your explanation

54
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,373
that the victims of those killings
had committed minor crimes

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,418
that never would have been
punished by Kira.

56
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,628
That's not all.

57
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:37,509
The Kira that we've presumed until now
needed a face and a name to kill.

58
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,637
But judging from the fact that
Mr. Ukita was killed

59
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,390
as soon as he arrived at
the television station,

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,935
and considering how Kira practically
told me that he could kill me

61
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,311
if "L" appeared on

62
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,108
means that the Second Kira can kill
by just seeing someone's face.

63
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,321
So, I'll ask Light to look
at the investigative facts and the video.

64
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,658
If he suggests that there may
be a second Kira,

65
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,494
then he's almost completely cleared.

66
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,705
Ryuzaki, what do you mean?

67
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,250
If he's Kira, he'll want to kill me,

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,044
the one in charge of
the investigation.

69
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,174
At this rate, if I go along with
the Second Kira's demands

70
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,177
and appear three days later on TV,
I will die.

71
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,348
I don't think that Kira would miss
an easy chance to kill me.

72
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,850
So what you're saying is that

73
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,436
if my son doesn't deduce that
there is a second Kira,

74
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,521
then you'll continue to suspect him?

75
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,567
No. In that case, it will remain below
a five-percent chance.

76
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,444
And we'll tell him that

77
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,740
we are investigating the possibility of
a second Kira and have him assist us.

78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:50,207
<i>I trust you now believe
that I'm Kira.</i>

79
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,710
<i>- Could it be that the reason...
- On the given day and time...</i>

80
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>why I feel so disgusted
when I watch this...</i>

81
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>is because I'm the real Kira?</i>

82
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>This is about more than just
tarnishing Kira's reputation.</i>

83
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,803
<i>So why isn't...</i>

84
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,806
<i>...anyone giving me any explanation
about this video?</i>

85
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,390
<i>That's strange...</i>

86
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>Well, whatever the case,</i>

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,814
<i>I won't say anything careless
about this video.</i>

88
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,650
<i>If I leave the situation alone,
L will die.</i>

89
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,404
Light, what do you think?
Did you get something from it?

90
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:22,948
Hmm?

91
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,992
<i>Damn him!</i>

92
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,206
There may be more than one person
who has Kira's power.

93
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,751
Kira's power?!
Light, what do you mean?!

94
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,711
There is a good chance that

95
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,089
this is not the Kira
we've known up to now.

96
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,969
Up to now, Kira's never used suspects
like these for his announced killings.

97
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,640
And if Kira needs a face
and a name to kill...

98
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,685
isn't it strange that he was able
to kill the detective and officers

99
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,812
who happened to go to
the television studios?

100
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,689
It's the same.

101
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,693
It's exactly the same deduction as L,
I mean Ryuzaki.

102
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,987
<i>You did well, Light.</i>

103
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,823
<i>You should be cleared now...</i>

104
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,242
That's right, Light.

105
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,537
I also think we are looking
at a second Kira.

106
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,122
<i>I thought so...</i>

107
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,084
So you knew, Ryuga,
I mean Ryuzaki?

108
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,795
Did you test me, knowing that?

109
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,964
I didn't test you.

110
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,677
It's not convincing if I'm the only one
who argues that there is a second Kira.

111
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,597
With you coming to
the same conclusion as I did,

112
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,640
my theory becomes more believable.

113
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,936
You've been of great assistance to me,
Light. Thank you so much.

114
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,147
So, it's decided.

115
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,442
We first have to stop the second Kira.

116
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
He obviously sympathizes with Kira,
and is not very bright.

117
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,825
I think he'll obey the real Kira.

118
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
So if we make a fake message
from the real Kira,

119
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,122
there is a good chance that
we can stop him.

120
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,917
As I expected of you, Ryuzaki.

121
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,086
I also thought that would
be the best idea.

122
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,213
Light...

123
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,216
I would like you to play
the part of the real Kira.

124
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,594
M- Me?

125
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,848
Yes. With your abilities,
you should be able to do it.

126
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,017
At any rate, we don't have
any time to waste.

127
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,353
Could you script a message
from Kira...

128
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,689
to air on tonight's news?

129
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,692
<i>Damn him...</i>

130
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,363
<i>He planned from the beginning
to bring me here to play this role.</i>

131
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,367
Ryuzaki, is this all right?

132
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
I think I've portrayed
Kira convincingly.

133
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,040
I think this is very good,

134
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,460
but if we don't remove the part
which says, "You're free to kill L,"

135
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,212
I'll die.

136
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
Well, when pretending to be Kira,

137
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,637
I thought that he would
demand that "L" be killed.

138
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,514
It's just a bit of a joke.

139
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,058
You can change that to
whatever you like.

140
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,184
Yes.

141
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,397
Mr. Aihara, the script is ready.
I leave it to you.

142
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,898
All right.

143
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>And now a shocking development.</i>

144
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,947
<i>In response to the video that was sent
and aired on Sakura TV a few days ago,</i>

145
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,701
<i>another person claiming to be
the real Kira has appeared.</i>

146
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:18,790
<i>He has ordered several
television stations to air his message.</i>

147
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,128
<i>The police department has
authorized us to broadcast this video.</i>

148
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,424
<i>Is this the real Kira?
Is this another Kira?</i>

149
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,428
<i>First, please take a look at the video.</i>

150
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,431
<i>I am Kira.</i>

151
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,933
I did it! Kira responded!

152
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,602
<i>I am the real Kira.</i>

153
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,816
<i>The Kira who was on Sakura TV
a few days ago is not.</i>

154
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>I will show leniency
to the impostor</i>

155
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:55,243
<i>because I am assuming he did it
out of an attempt to help me.</i>

156
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:01,124
<i>But killing the innocent is
against my beliefs.</i>

157
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:07,213
<i>If the impostor truly sympathizes
with me and wants to help my cause...</i>

158
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:12,927
<i>I ask that he refrain from killing aimlessly
and accept my basic principles.</i>

159
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>- If you ignore this warning...
- All right! The video, the video!</i>

160
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,475
<i>- and continue to be reckless...
- What are you planning to do?</i>

161
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,145
I'm going to reply to him,
of course.

162
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,566
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

163
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,818
- What?!
- It's here!

164
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,988
<i>I will bring the entire
envelope there, but...</i>

165
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:36,076
<i>for the time being, I'll play
a copy through the computer.</i>

166
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,664
<i>Mr. Kira, thank you for your reply.</i>

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,501
<i>I will do as you say.</i>

168
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,503
- Wow!
- We did it!

169
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:51,758
<i>"I will do as you say," huh?
I don't know if I can use him.</i>

170
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,969
<i>If he really knows Kira's feelings,</i>

171
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,181
<i>he would force L to appear
on TV and kill him.</i>

172
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,184
<i>Don't fall for something like this...
Damn it!</i>

173
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,145
<i>I want to meet you.</i>

174
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,981
<i>I don't think you have the eyes, but...</i>

175
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,110
<i>I won't try to kill you.</i>

176
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,694
<i>Please don't worry.</i>

177
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,197
<i>Is he stupid?</i>

178
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,867
<i>He talked about the Shinigami eyes
on a tape the whole world will see?</i>

179
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,620
He just said that he didn't
have "the eyes," didn't he?

180
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,996
What could that mean?

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,081
Who knows...?

182
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:28,086
<i>Please think of a We y We can meet
Without the police knowing.</i>

183
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,046
<i>When we meet,</i>

184
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,882
<i>we can conﬁrm each other,
by showing our Shinigami.</i>

185
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,843
Shinigami?!

186
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,927
<i>He's no good.</i>

187
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,221
<i>I have to do something fast
about this guy, or else...</i>

188
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,265
What?!

189
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
Ryuzaki!

190
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,274
Are you all right?!

191
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Sh...

192
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,402
Shini... garni?!

193
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,740
Are we supposed to accept
the existence of something like that?

194
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,045
Shinigami?

195
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:16,217
Are we supposed to accept
the existence of something like that?

196
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,636
Impossible...

197
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,555
There's no such thing...

198
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,185
That's right, Ryuzaki.
Shinigami don't exist.

199
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:33,568
Kira had those criminals in prison
write something about Shinigami...

200
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,489
So shouldn't we assume that
this is the same Kira?

201
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,367
It's the same person,
so they say the same things.

202
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,203
That can't be, Dad.

203
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:49,250
If this is the same Kira from before,
he wouldn't have replied to our video.

204
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,921
There is no way that the real Kira
would go through the trouble

205
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,758
of getting L to appear on TV,
only to stop trying to kill him.

206
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,677
Then maybe the real Kira and
the Second Kira...

207
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,512
already have established
a connection.

208
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,266
And decided to use the word "Shinigami"
to throw off the investigation.

209
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,976
That's also not possible.

210
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,854
<i>It's as Light says.</i>

211
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,481
If the two Kiras were connected,

212
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,734
I don't think that he would stop
trying to kill me.

213
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,657
Second Kira is acting
independent of the first.

214
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,577
They want to meet the real Kira.

215
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,623
That's right. They're acting
out of interest in Kira.

216
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,878
"Shinigami" probably refers to
their killing power.

217
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,590
"We can confirm our identities by showing
our Shinigami to each other,"

218
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,925
probably means...

219
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,679
"We can confirm our identities by
showing each other our killing power. "

220
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,431
That's right.

221
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,810
The word "Shinigami" is
a word that has

222
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,982
some meaning between
Kira and Second Kira.

223
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,361
We should try to get him to
tell us what it means.

224
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,656
So are you going to respond
and force him to be more direct?

225
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:08,037
If we don't ask him properly,
he'll know that we're not Kira.

226
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,917
No, I shall leave the rest to
Kira and Second Kira.

227
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,877
Leave it to them?

228
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:21,342
We can assume the second Kira is
satisfied after receiving a reply from Kira.

229
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,596
He thinks that
he's got Kira's attention.

230
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,726
And he also used a word that
only the two of them would understand.

231
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,856
This reply will air today on
Sakura TV's six o'clock news.

232
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,942
Of course, Kira should be watching
the exchange

233
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,195
between our made-up Kira
and the Second Kira.

234
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,325
From Kira's viewpoint, he'll want
to prevent the Second Kira from coming

235
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,369
into direct contact with the police.

236
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:54,834
Maybe this time,
the real Kira will respond.

237
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,589
But what if Kira doesn't reply?

238
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,552
Yes... I thought of what we could do
with the Second Kira in that case, but...

239
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,349
If he reveals more information that
Kira doesn't want the police to know,

240
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,851
and makes Kira more nervous
and furious,

241
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,853
in order to pressure Kira
into meeting him...

242
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,688
That would be interesting.

243
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,107
It would be more interesting...

244
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,486
if Kira gets scared and sends a reply
in order to avoid that.

245
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,366
Then there's a chance we could obtain
some physical evidence from Kira himself.

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
In the meantime,

247
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,579
let's focus on gathering all the information
we can from the Second Kira's package.

248
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,377
That's good...

249
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,962
Just like that!

250
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,509
That was great, just great, Misa.

251
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,676
That was wonderful!

252
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,889
I'm worn out...

253
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,017
Modeling sure uses a lot of energy!

254
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,812
Hey, Rem.

255
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,439
Can I ask you something?

256
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,982
What is it?

257
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,444
Shinigami always have to have
a Death Note.

258
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,822
Soto give one to a human
to play with,

259
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,740
the Shinigami needs to have
two Death Notes...

260
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,159
That means that Ryuk,
who gave the extra Death Note to Kira,

261
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,163
was able to trick the Shinigami King
and get two, right?

262
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,832
Right.

263
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,250
Then you too?

264
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,130
No. The Shinigami King
isn't fooled that easily.

265
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,132
Then how?

266
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,302
I'll just say... I'm one of the few
in the Shinigami Realm

267
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:34,475
who know how to kill a Shinigami.

268
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:40,565
Oh, then you killed a Shinigami
and gave his notebook to me.

269
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,152
No. I didn't kill him.

270
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,073
I just happened to be around
when a Shinigami died...

271
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,827
So, tell me how to kill a Shinigami.

272
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,247
Don't tell anyone, okay?

273
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,418
The way to kill a Shinigami...

274
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,380
is to make them fall
in love with a human.

275
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,802
What a beautiful way to kill.

276
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,438
There once was a Shinigami
named Gelus

277
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,400
who used to watch a girl
from the Shinigami Realm.

278
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,989
Gelus was always looking
at that girl from the Shinigami Realm.

279
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,211
It's today, isn't it?
The end of her life.

280
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,882
She looks so healthy.
Why today?

281
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,052
Why...

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,054
today?

283
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,437
I wanted to know how
she was going to die too,

284
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,856
and decided to watch with him.

285
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,905
The girl was walking alone
at night on the street.

286
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,783
And then...

287
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,747
Suddenly from an alley,

288
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,626
a man appeared and confessed
his love for the girl.

289
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,878
I love you more
than anyone else in the world!

290
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,005
I'm always watching you!
I want to protect you forever!

291
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,758
It was a man she didn't know.

292
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,010
The girl turned him down, of course.

293
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,520
Then... I'll kill you...

294
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,772
Then kill myself-!

295
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,279
H- Hey.

296
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,572
Stop!

297
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,704
Gelus did something that
a Shinigami should never do.

298
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,807
Gelus used his Death Note
to save the girl.

299
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
But that was not good.

300
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:31,652
Shinigami shorten human lives.
They only exist to take lives.

301
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,670
At that moment,

302
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:54,842
Gelus became something which was
neither sand nor rust, and died.

303
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,431
Only his Death Note was left.

304
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:11,400
Then Gelus' remaining life span was
transferred to the girl whose life he saved.

305
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,739
Does that mean that the Shinigami
wouldn't have died

306
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,367
if he hadn't fallen in love
with that girl?

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,035
That's right.

308
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,748
So...

309
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,504
It was a Shinigami named Gelus
who saved me that day.

310
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,381
Yes.

311
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,258
Gelus was in love with you.

312
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,554
So that notebook is yours.

313
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,474
Yeah...

314
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,647
I see. In order to kill a Shinigami

315
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,942
you need him to fall in love with
a human and save that person.

316
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,029
What about you, Rem?
Are you in love with me?

317
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,325
Give it up. You can't kill me.

318
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,703
Oh? You figured it out?

319
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,709
But now I have something
I can tell Kira.

320
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:15,339
I wonder if he knows?
How to kill a Shinigami?

321
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:21,512
I asked him on TV,
"Please tell me how I can meet you,"

322
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,597
but he hasn't replied.

323
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,059
Maybe I should send him
another message.

324
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,522
<i>This isn't good...</i>

325
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,025
<i>I can't leave the Second Kira
alone like this.</i>

326
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>If the Second Kira makes
a fatal slip-up</i>

327
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,573
<i>and is caught by the police,</i>

328
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>there is a chance that the police
will find out about the Death Note.</i>

329
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,288
Welcome.

330
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,374
A strawberry sundae, please.

331
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,251
Certainly.

332
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,337
<i>So what should I do?</i>

333
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,091
<i>How can I contact the Second Kira
without L noticing?</i>

334
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,802
Thank you for waiting.

335
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,809
<i>I want to meet Kira soon!</i>

336
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,686
<i>But at any rate...</i>

337
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,898
<i>What kind of a person are you,
Fake Kira?</i>

338
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,777
<i>What kind of a person are you, Kira?</i>

339
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,118
TO BE CONTINUED

340
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:31,415
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

341
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:36,796
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

342
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,341
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

343
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:45,805
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

344
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:52,228
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

345
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,816
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

346
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,488
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

347
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,283
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

348
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>To accomplish</i>

349
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:20,798
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

350
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

351
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,725
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

352
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,648
PREVIEW

353
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,947
If Fake Kira is caught, I'll have to
get my hands on his notebook.

354
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,534
In the worst case scenario,
I may have to kill everyone there.
