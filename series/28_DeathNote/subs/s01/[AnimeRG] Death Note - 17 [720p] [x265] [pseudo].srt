1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,263
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,114
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,244
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,468
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,474
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,354
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,006
EXECUTION

17
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,430
Use it just like that to kill
the criminals who are broadcast.

18
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,100
Then, you can use the notebook
however you want.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,643
Those are the conditions.

20
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>If everything goes according to
Light Yagami's plans,</i>

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,024
<i>this is sure to save Misa...</i>

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,821
This is a good deal
for both of us, isn't it?

23
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,034
Or I guess as you would say...
it's good business.

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,334
FIFTIETH DAY

25
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,004
There's no reason for you
to stay there like that.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>It's been over a month since Kira
started to kill criminals again...</i>

27
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,639
<i>I am sure that my son isn't Kira...</i>

28
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>Now, all that's left
is for you to be sure...</i>

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,272
<i>I get out when my son does...</i>

30
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,776
The Chief sure is stubborn...

31
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,196
Light, are you all right?

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,533
<i>Yeah. I'm all right, but... Ryuzaki...</i>

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>criminals have stopped dying
since I've been conﬁned.</i>

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,290
<i>I think it's highly likely that
Kira is someone</i>

35
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,918
<i>who knows about my situation.</i>

36
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,294
<i>- If we go with this line of reasoning...
- No.</i>

37
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,631
Criminals are not dying
because you are Kira.

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>No! I'm not Kira.</i>

39
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,218
<i>How many times must
I say it until you'll understand?</i>

40
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,264
<i>Kira should know that killings
have begun again...</i>

41
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,141
<i>It doesn't seem like he knows...</i>

42
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,519
This is cruel, Ryuzaki...

43
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,564
You still haven't told Light that
criminals are being killed again...

44
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>Amane...</i>

45
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,777
Yes?

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,779
<i>I know you're tired,
but are you all right?</i>

47
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,240
Are you stupid?

48
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,492
There'd be something
wrong with me

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,202
if I was all right after
all these days...

50
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>Yes, that's true.</i>

51
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,709
Let me go...
I want to see Light...

52
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,627
Light...

53
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,379
Light...

54
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,131
<i>Light...</i>

55
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,635
it seems like all three
of them are at their limit...

56
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,763
Ryuzaki, why are you
still detaining Light?

57
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,265
You should let him go already!

58
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,183
If you do, the Chief
will come out too.

59
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,352
Criminals are still being killed

60
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,063
even though Misa and Light aren't
able to obtain any information.

61
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,607
We know at least that much.

62
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,484
No.

63
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,822
All we know is that Amane harbors an
unnaturally strong love for Light Yagami.

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,660
Ryuzaki... Sorry, but I think
that you're doing this

65
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,998
because you don't want to admit
that you were wrong about Light.

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,833
I figured you might think that.

67
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,297
As Light has said, Kira's killed
Lind L.Tailor and the FBI agents.

68
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,216
If Kira could kill under surveillance and
without obtaining information,

69
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,011
there would have been no need
to kill Tailor and the FBI agents!

70
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,972
No matter how hard we investigate,
he can't be traced.

71
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,141
Kira doesn't kill without a reason.

72
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,810
You even said so yourself.

73
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,729
I see...

74
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,856
If he could kill
in these circumstances,

75
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,276
he shouldn't have had a problem
with leaving those FBI agents alone...

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,738
It's already been fifty days...

77
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,115
There's no reason to be doing this.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,077
Besides that, we should be thinking
of ways to catch the real Kira.

79
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,179
I understand.

80
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,891
<i>Mr. Yagami.</i>

81
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,392
What is it?

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>Will you return to
task force headquarters?</i>

83
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,649
<i>I want you to hear my theory
on what's happening.</i>

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,861
<i>But ﬁrst, I want to talk to you
as Light's father.</i>

85
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,864
All right.

86
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,136
THREE DAYS LATER

87
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,641
I never thought that you would
be an old man, Mister Stalker.

88
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,394
I'm not a stalker. I'm a detective.

89
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,979
<i>A detective?!</i>

90
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,689
I remember now!

91
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,276
I was told that I was being arrested
for being the Second Kira or something...

92
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,152
That was for real?

93
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,988
No way...

94
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,575
The police wouldn't
tie me up like that...

95
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,077
Anyways, it's kind of funny how

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,746
my hands and feet are restrained
even though you're going to let me go?

97
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,456
Be quiet.

98
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,804
- Light!
- Misa?

99
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,472
I was dying to see you!

100
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,433
Dad, what's going on?

101
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,518
Huh? Dad?
Oh no!

102
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,771
I called your dad a stalker and
other rude things like that...

103
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,981
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,900
My name is Misa Amane.
I'm currently going out with Light-!

105
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,443
I leave it to you, Chief.

106
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,573
What's wrong?
Hurry up and get in.

107
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,207
We're finally cleared
and are free to go, right?

108
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,959
No...

109
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,880
You two are now...
being taken to your execution.

110
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,385
An execution ground has been prepared
in an underground facility.

111
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,055
I volunteered to escort you there.

112
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,556
- Our execution?
- What?!

113
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,558
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- This is a joke, isn't it?

114
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,644
L has decided that
Light Yagami is Kira

115
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,271
and Misa Amane is
the Second Kira.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,984
L's declared that if you were executed,
the killings would stop.

117
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,820
Haven't the killings stopped?

118
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,822
No, they're still continuing.

119
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,534
Continuing?
That's not what he told me...

120
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,622
L was trying to get
a confession out of you.

121
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,707
That's not the problem here.

122
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:43,838
L's suggestion that the killings
would stop if you two were eliminated...

123
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,841
was immediately accepted
by all the top officials of the UN

124
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,134
and the Japanese government.

125
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,972
Kira will be eradicated in secret.

126
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,433
That's crazy.
Wait, Dad, I'm not Kira!

127
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,769
That's right, sir.
What are you thinking?!

128
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,229
He's your own son!

129
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,024
This is not my decision, it's L's.

130
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,613
He has solved many difficult cases
in the past and never been wrong.

131
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,159
Dad...
Do you believe L over me?

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,871
L says that if the killings don't stop,

133
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,916
then he'll take responsibility
and end his own life...

134
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,545
L... What are you thinking?

135
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,047
I understand that from the facts
that we have up to now,

136
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,383
this may seem like
the only logical assumption...

137
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,427
But this is wrong!

138
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,013
Why did L come to this conclusion?

139
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,181
Something's strange...

140
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,350
This isn't like L at all...

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,855
L's always used hard evidence
in all of his cases.

142
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,982
Why would he let
this one end like this?

143
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,109
We're almost there.

144
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,336
Where are we?

145
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,630
Why did you bring us out to
the middle of nowhere?

146
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,090
What are you going to do?

147
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,843
Are you going to let us go?

148
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,930
Nobody will see us here...

149
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,310
I decided to bring you here
instead of the execution ground.

150
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
Light...

151
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,692
I'm going to kill you here
and then kill myself.

152
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,403
What are you talking about, Dad!

153
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,197
- That's crazy!
- Stop it already! You're crazy!

154
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,616
You're going to kill your child
and kill yourself?

155
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,077
If you want to die, then why don't
you just die by yourself!

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,120
If you do this, then you'll be
no different from Kira.

157
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,955
No... I'm different from Kira.

158
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,627
I have a responsibility as a parent
and as the Detective Superintendent!

159
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,796
Dad, Misa's right!

160
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,799
If we die here,
we'll never uncover the truth!

161
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,217
It would be better if we ran away!

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,426
It's too late, Light...

163
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,471
Either way, you'll be executed...

164
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,307
At least this way... it'll be...
by my own hand.

165
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,104
Stop, Dad! I'm not Kira!

166
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,147
If I die here,
we all fall into Kira's trap!

167
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,565
Don't you see?!

168
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,986
Amane... I'm going to die here
with my son.

169
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,531
I have no reason to kill you.

170
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,034
The police will probably
find this car soon.

171
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,788
You'll be executed
at the planned site.

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,380
Light... from one murderer to another,
I'll see you in hell!

173
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,757
Dad!

174
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,679
Stop!

175
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,697
Light... from one murderer to another,
I'll see you in hell.

176
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,865
Dad!

177
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,219
A blank?

178
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,141
Thank goodness...

179
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,228
"Thank goodness?"
What are you doing, Dad?

180
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,355
Forgive me, you two...

181
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,027
This was the only way to
free you from confinement...

182
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,987
But please understand...

183
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,074
I did this because I believe
that you're not Kira...

184
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,410
Were you watching, Ryuzaki?

185
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,370
I did as you said,

186
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,206
and as you can see,
I'm still alive.

187
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,126
<i>Yes, it was a convincing performance.</i>

188
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,213
If Amane were the Second Kira,

189
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,548
who can kill just by
knowing a person's face,

190
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,510
then she would have killed you
before you fired.

191
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,513
Also, if Light were Kira,

192
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,434
the Kira I know would even kill
his parents if he was in trouble.

193
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,979
In Light's case, I cannot deny
the possibility

194
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,106
that he may have discovered
it was all an act halfway through.

195
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,152
But as I promised,
I will end their confinement.

196
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,863
Also as promised,

197
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,783
even though she insists that
those tapes were just occult videos,

198
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,201
we have various pieces of evidence

199
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,245
and a confession that
she sent the Kira videos.

200
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,996
So Misa Amane will remain
under surveillance

201
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,540
until Kira is caught and
his case is resolved.

202
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,668
<i>What's with that?
Do you still suspect me?</i>

203
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,089
Well, you get to return to
your normal life.

204
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,174
If you're not guilty,

205
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,386
you can think of the surveillance
as police protection.

206
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,556
I see. Since I'm not the Second Kira,

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,059
I should think of it like
I have some bodyguards.

208
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,937
<i>Also Light...</i>

209
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,774
I will make arrangements so that you
and I will be together 24 hours a day,

210
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,318
working on the investigation.

211
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,371
All right, Ryuzaki.
Let's catch Kira together.

212
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,957
<i>Yes. I'm looking forward
to working with you.</i>

213
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,381
Is this really necessary, Ryuzaki?

214
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,509
I'm not doing this
because I want to.

215
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,305
Huh? Is this what you meant by being
together with him 24 hours a day?

216
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,849
Two guys chained together
is kinda gross...

217
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,475
Ryuzaki, is that what you're into?

218
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,562
I told you I'm not doing
this because I want to.

219
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,231
But, Light belongs to Misa...

220
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,066
If you're together with him
24 hours a day,

221
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,943
then when will I have the time
to go on dates with him?

222
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,113
Dates will be with the three of us.

223
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,491
Huh? Are you telling me
we have to kiss in front of you?

224
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,412
I'm not telling you to do anything.
But I will be watching.

225
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,039
What's with that?

226
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,582
You really are a pervert, aren't you?

227
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,126
Light, please silence Misa.

228
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,503
Misa, don't be selfish.

229
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,923
You were definitely
the one who sent the tapes,

230
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,385
just be grateful that you're allowed
as much freedom as this.

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,596
Huh? What are you talking about?

232
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,849
I'm your girlfriend, aren't I?
Don't you trust your own lover?

233
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,603
Girlfriend? You said you fell in love
with me at first sight...

234
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,646
It's one-sided and
you won't leave me alone.

235
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:20,360
So then, you took advantage
of that fact and kissed me?

236
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,237
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

237
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,448
About this "love at first sight" thing...

238
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,077
It happened in Aoyama
on May 22, didn't it, Misa?

239
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,370
Yes.

240
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,997
Why did you go to Aoyama
on that day?

241
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,582
What did you wear?

242
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,126
I told you, I just happened
to go there.

243
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,336
How many times have I told you?

244
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,964
I don't really remember how
I felt that day or what I wore!

245
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,927
Is it so wrong for me to be
hanging out in Aoyama without a reason?

246
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,596
So when you came back
from Aoyama,

247
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,556
you were in love with Light and

248
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,891
- knew his name.
- Yes.

249
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,894
You don't even know
how you knew his name.

250
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,229
Yes. That's right.

251
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,273
Then, how would you feel
if Light was Kira?

252
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,901
Huh? If Light was Kira?

253
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,277
That's right.

254
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,073
That would be wonderful!

255
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,991
I've always been grateful to Kira

256
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,453
for punishing the man
who murdered my parents.

257
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,165
If Light were Kira,
I'd love him more...

258
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,919
Even though I love him
so much already!

259
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,712
We're talking about Kira, here.

260
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,506
You'd love him even more?

261
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,425
Don't you feel afraid at all?

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,677
That's supposing if Light is Kira, right?

263
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,429
He's not scary at all.

264
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm one of those people
who accept Kira.

265
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,892
I'd think of ways I could help him.

266
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,606
You'd probably get in his way
rather than help him...

267
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,733
According to this,

268
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,987
there's no mistake that
you are the Second Kira,

269
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,450
but it's so clear-cut that
I don't want to believe it.

270
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,620
Good. Don't believe it,
because I'm not Kira!

271
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,665
Anyway, you'll remain
under surveillance.

272
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,836
When you go out, contact us using
this room's extension.

273
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,088
From now on for private
and work-related affairs,

274
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,008
Mr. Matsuda will accompany you
as your manager, Matsui.

275
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,634
I've already paid off your agency

276
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,970
- to agree to this.
- Hey there, I'm Matsui.

277
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,682
I haven't told the police,
so be sure not to give yourself away.

278
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,852
This old man's gonna be my manager?
How awful...

279
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,063
No way!
What's wrong with me, Misa-Misa?

280
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,570
Cut it outwith all this dating,
kissing, and Misa-Misa talk!

281
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>This is the Kira case! Understand?!</i>

282
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,823
Take it seriously!

283
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,117
Sorry.

284
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,371
No, I'm sorry.
I know we're taking it seriously, but...

285
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,791
Amane, go to your room now.

286
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,876
What?

287
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,170
No questions, c'mon.

288
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,465
Light! Let's go on a date,
even if it's the three of us!

289
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,386
Light, are you serious about Amane?

290
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,848
No... As I said earlier,
it's one-sided...

291
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,560
Then could you act as
if you're serious?

292
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,271
I'm sure that Amane's connected
with the Second Kira

293
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,773
from the video incident.

294
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,026
And also from the way she loves you...

295
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,278
Are you asking me to become
intimate with her

296
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,572
so I can find out information
about the Second Kira?

297
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,034
Yes. I think you can do it.

298
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,454
And we could get the clues to solve
this case from Amane.

299
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,123
This is why I released both of you.

300
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,085
Ryuzaki...

301
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,713
Even if it's for the Kira case,

302
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,050
I could never toy with
a woman's emotions like that.

303
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm sorry,
you need to understand.

304
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,475
To me, taking advantage of another
person's feelings is unforgivable,

305
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,227
and the most despicable thing
a person can do.

306
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,688
<i>There's something wrong...</i>

307
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,065
<i>I can only assume that
his personality has changed...</i>

308
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,276
<i>Is this really an act?</i>

309
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,406
<i>At this rate, it sounds like Amane
was being controlled by Kira, but...</i>

310
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>Light Yagami as well...</i>

311
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,245
What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

312
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,247
Nothing. You're right.

313
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,708
But, it would be helpful if
you could make sure

314
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,129
she doesn't leak any information
about the investigation.

315
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:15,261
Ryuzaki, can't we change this system
of changing hotels every few days?

316
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,140
Yes. I've also been thinking about that.

317
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,476
That's why... construction
started on this immediately after

318
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,729
my first meeting with Mr. Yagami
and the others,

319
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
when we decided
to investigate together.

320
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,191
It will be completed in
just a few more days.

321
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,485
This is it.

322
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,781
It has twenty-three floors
above the ground and two below.

323
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,701
It's built so you can't see it
from the outside,

324
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,037
but there are two helicopters
on the roof.

325
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
What?!

326
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,205
That's amazing...

327
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,584
I would like all of you to spend
as much time here as possible.

328
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,086
Even if the number of investigators
increases on this case,

329
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,255
we can accommodate
about sixty people.

330
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,925
Misa will get her own floor
so that should keep her happy.

331
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,013
This is really amazing...
but to go to these lengths...

332
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,642
By the way, Ryuzaki, where's the money
to pay for this coming from?

333
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,852
As you can see,

334
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,480
I want to solve this case,
no matter what.

335
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,814
That's what it means.

336
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
No, you didn't answer the question.

337
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,318
Yeah, that's right.

338
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,237
The mass murders are bad enough,

339
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,616
but I can't forgive the one who
put my dad and me through all of this.

340
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,535
I want to solve this,
no matter what.

341
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,954
"No matter what"? Then how about

342
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,082
getting closer to Misa
and get her to reveal...

343
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,501
I can't do that.
That's against my code.

344
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,295
I see... That's too bad.

345
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,467
Sorry, I just feel very motivated.

346
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,095
Ryuzaki, Chief Yagami, Light...

347
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,681
Let's all try to catch Kira,
no matter what!

348
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,476
Excuse me...
But you didn't include me...

349
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,324
It seems we're all here.
Then let's begin our meeting.

350
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,036
For the further advancement
of the Yotsuba Group...

351
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,872
and for our company to become
the greatest corporation in the world...

352
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,208
Who shall we kill?

353
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,379
It's tough to kill someone
every week...

354
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,674
This may be irrelevant,

355
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,760
but why has Kira
started killing like this?

356
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,097
Takahashi,
haven't you figured it out?

357
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,852
This is the most advantageous
course of action for Kira.

358
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,646
Advantageous? The fact that
Kira has begun a killing service...

359
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,106
is advantageous, Higuchi?

360
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,317
I think you should keep quiet.

361
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,403
You might be killed
for being such an idiot.

362
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,574
The eight of us here are still young,

363
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,077
but all of us have a chance of
landing in the CEO's chair before long.

364
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,789
And since we started these meetings,

365
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,417
our salaries have been raised well
above the other employees.

366
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,755
It's kind of odd that Kira
would back a single company.

367
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,381
No matter how I think about it...

368
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,802
one of us here has to be Kira.

369
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:08,768
TAKESHI OOl... EIICHI TAKAHASHI...
MASAHIKO KIDA... KYOSUKE HIGUCHI...

370
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,485
Humans...

371
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,822
are disgusting creatures...

372
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,160
TO BE CONTINUED

373
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

374
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:36,962
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

375
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,466
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

376
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:45,971
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

377
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:52,353
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

378
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,941
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

379
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:02,613
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

380
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

381
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,079
<i>To accomplish</i>

382
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,965
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

383
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:26,053
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

384
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,851
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

385
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,940
PREVIEW

386
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,400
This is not good.

387
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,989
The way you talk, it's almost like
you won't be satisfied unless I'm Kira...

388
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,324
Stop messing around, Ryuzaki!

389
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,161
ALLY
