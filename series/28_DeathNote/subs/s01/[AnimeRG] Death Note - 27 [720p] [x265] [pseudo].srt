00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,570
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,530

00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,371

DECEMBER 2007

16
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,760
Say it again!

17
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,390
L is dead.

18
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,728
Dead?! Why?

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,732
Did Kira kill him?

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,442
Is that it?

21
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,235
Probably...

22
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:54,281
He said that he would get Kira
executed... but he was killed?!

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,741
Is that what you're saying?!

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,075
Mello...

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,214
If you can't beat the game...
If you can't solve the puzzle...

26
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,759
You're nothing but a loser.

27
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,474
Me or Near?
So which one of us did L...?

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,520
Neither one of you yet...

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,607
He can't choose... if he's dead.

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,612
Mello... Near...

31
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,324
How about the both of you
work together...?

32
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,660
Sure. Sounds good.

33
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,707
That's impossible, Roger.

34
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,503
You know that Near and
I don't get along.

35
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,880
We've always competed
against each other...

36
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,216
Always!

37
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,980
It's fine, Roger.

38
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,275
Near should succeed L.

39
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,903
Unlike me, Near will...

40
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,698
solve this unemotionally,
like a puzzle.

41
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,539
I'm going to leave this institution.

42
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,790
Mello!

43
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,376
I'm almost fifteen, anyway.

44
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,547
I'll live my life my own way.

45
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,432
A police officer who was in the vicinity
when Higuchi was arrested...

46
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,600
heard that if you write

47
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,980
the name of someone you know in
the notebook, that person will die.

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,525
Are you saying that's what
the notebook of death is?

49
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,487
Yes. The Japanese police
should have it right now.

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,950
A YOUNG MAN NAMED NEAR PRESENTS
EVIDENCE ON THE KIRA CASE

51
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,162
WHICH HE'S GATHERED BY HIMSELF
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.

52
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,874
HE MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT
ACCOMPANIED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,627
Mr. President, the current L is one

54
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,757
that the Japanese police have
created to avoid confusion.

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,341
L is dead.

56
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,597
Director Mason... Who is he?

57
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,098
Well...

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,728
He is, let's just say...
he's L's true successor.

59
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,856
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

60
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:37,944
CREATES THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION TEAM
INDEPENDENT OF L TO GO AFTER KIRA.

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,197
THE SPK

62
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,451
IS COMPOSED OF HAND-PICKED
FBI AND CIA AGENTS ALONG WITH NEAR.

63
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,582
ABDUCTION

64
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,585
But...

65
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,922
It's impossible to censor
the internet and...

66
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,132
the Kira case has slowed to
a dead-end lately...

67
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,428
Maybe those who show people
they want killed on the internet

68
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,055
should be killed.

69
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,393
But Kira gets some of his information
from the internet,

70
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,687
so he won't kill them.

71
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,316
Matsu, your idea is full
of contradictions.

72
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,528
If only people wouldn't
do bad things...

73
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,739
Or rather... the world's become
a good place for the innocent.

74
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,368
I suppose there are people
who might believe that.

75
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,204
<i>Look who's talking.</i>

76
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,291
<i>No... Soon everyone will
think in that way...</i>

77
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,211
Are you talking about that again?

78
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,129
Please stop...

79
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,881
Dear, and Light.

80
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,842
I'm home...

81
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,636
Welcome back!

82
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,304
Welcome home, Sayu.

83
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,640
Light, Misa.

84
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,185
It's unusual for both of
you to be here. Welcome.

85
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,187
Pardon the intrusion.

86
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,399
Mr. Matsuda, wasn't it?

87
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,483
oh, yes!

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,402
It's been a while.

89
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,988
Thank you for taking care
of my father.

90
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,698
S- Sayu...

91
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,076
Y- You've grown up and
you're so pretty...

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,495
When I last saw you,
you were like this...

93
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,540
Matsu's bright red!

94
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,917
Huh? No way!

95
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,712
There's no way I'm letting
Sayu marry a detective.

96
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,463
- Huh?
- That's right.

97
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,132
I definitely don't want that.

98
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,925
What? No way!

99
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,762
I never even got to propose...
or even confess that I love her...

100
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,681
Mom and Dad.

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,099
- Mo-!
- Da-!

102
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,102
Well... I think you're wonderful.

103
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,564
What...? R-Really, Sayu?

104
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,026
Yes. I might have considered
going out with you

105
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,570
if you were a little younger.

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,782
Good one Sayu!

107
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,119
Really. She's more mature
than Matsu.

108
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,623
But Light,
you haven't changed one bit

109
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,666
and you're as wonderful
as when I first met you.

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,127
Light, you've already found a career...

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,423
So stop just living together in secret
and get married already.

112
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,425
That sounds good!

113
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,554
<i>What an unfortunate
and heart-warming family...</i>

114
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,972
<i>How fun!</i>

115
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,896
What is it, Aizawa?

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes.

117
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,155
Yes. Yes. All right.

118
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,660
Matsuda, Light, come with me.

119
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,460
A kidnapping?
Who was kindapped? By whom?

120
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,046
Director Takimura of the NPA

121
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,673
I don't know by whom.

122
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,010
Damn it! As if the current situation
with the Kira case wasn't enough...

123
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,101
DEPUTY DIRECTOR

124
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,815
I got the phone call at 6:12.
45 minutes ago.

125
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,318
We determined it was from
the director's cell phone.

126
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,738
Did the kidnappers make
any demands?

127
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,365
Well...

128
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,913
They wanted to trade the director...
for the notebook of murder...

129
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,459
<i>Who? For what purpose?</i>

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
Do you suppose it's Kira?

131
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,423
Well, if the existence of
the Death Note was leaked,

132
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,258
countless people would want it...

133
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,636
Dad, how much does
the director know?

134
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,807
We tried to keep the knowledge
of the notebook within our group.

135
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,978
That's right. I never discussed it
with the director.

136
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,231
<i>The existence of the Death Note...</i>

137
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:48,903
<i>Someone knows that the NPA
has it and they've come to take it...</i>

138
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,908
Notify every bureau of the NPA only
about the director's kidnapping.

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,035
Yes.

140
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,509
Is it a call from the perp?

141
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,971
<i>No. There's someone who wants
to meet Director Takimura.</i>

142
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,431
What?

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,727
I'm John MacEnrow,
an agent with the FBI.

144
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,562
Of course, this is an alias.

145
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,232
Since what I am doing concerns Kira.

146
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,484
Please forgive me.

147
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,818
Kira...

148
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,614
The Director is out
at the moment.

149
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,575
If it's all right, I'll listen to what
you have to say.

150
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,578
Well, that's fine.

151
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,748
Excuse me for getting
straight to the point,

152
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,000
but the Japanese police
are unreliable.

153
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,253
In order to solve the Kira case,

154
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,589
we want you to hand over
the notebook to our country...

155
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,217
So it was the FBI!

156
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,636
Where have you taken
our director?!

157
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,137
W- What are you talking about?

158
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,222
Don't act like
you don't know!

159
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>This is a brazen criminal offense!</i>

160
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,478
<i>What would we gain by hiding
the director of Japan's NPA?</i>

161
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,355
<i>- Then how do you know about the notebook?!
- What's going on?</i>

162
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,819
It seems that the director of the NPA
has been kidnapped by someone.

163
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,239
Someone who wants
the notebook...

164
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,201
Commander Rester.

165
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,369
Hmm?

166
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,748
Suggest to him that we'd like to help
rescue the director

167
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,500
and apprehend the perpetrator.

168
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,211
We'll take the notebook when
we have the chance.

169
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,754
All right.

170
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,297
Can you hear me?

171
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,300
This is headquarters.
These are your orders.

172
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,949
Did he say anything?

173
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,161
Seems the Japanese police
are so afraid of Kira,

174
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,496
that the only ones
who are working with L are...

175
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,709
Soichiro Yagami, Kanzo Mogi,
and Tota Matsuda.

176
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,419
Isn't that right?

177
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,629
Yeah...

178
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,799
There was another called Ukita,
but he died...

179
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,303
Even though you were
the director of the NPA...

180
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,889
you didn't know about
the notebook?

181
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,475
The Japanese police really suck.

182
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,646
The highest-ranking of the three
is Yagami,

183
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,899
who was the chief detective
of the task force, right?

184
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,317
Yeah...

185
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,574
I think there are two notebooks.

186
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,037
Kira has one...
The NPA has the other.

187
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,291
We'll take both.

188
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,545
There's no mistake if
Mello says so.

189
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,218
Has he ever been wrong since
he joined us a year and a half ago?

190
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:04,057
But why is the guy who brought us the head
of a mafia boss Kira couldn't kill...

191
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,434
so fixated on the notebook?

192
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,437
I don't just want the notebook.

193
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,981
I want to kill everyone
who stands in my way...

194
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,984
And be number one!

195
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,948
<i>By whatever means necessary,
before Near does...</i>

196
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,152
B- Boss!

197
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,530
What is it? Be quiet.

198
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,534
Sorry. Eddie and I were
just talking... and

199
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,495
Takimura hung himself
with his necktie!

200
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,163
You idiot!

201
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,292
What good is a dead hostage?!

202
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,252
No, that's fine.

203
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>If Kira is responsible for this...</i>

204
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,884
<i>He can't touch us since he doesn't
know our names or faces.</i>

205
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,971
<i>That's why he went after Takimura</i>

206
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>Which means...</i>

207
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,435
<i>Kira is someone who knows
about this kidnapping...</i>

208
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,188
What are we going to do, Mello?

209
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:40,653
Kidnap Soichiro Yagami's daughter,
Sayu Yagami next.

210
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,368
There are still no clues about...

211
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,954
the director or the kidnappers...

212
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,998
Aside from that,
why haven't they said anything

213
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,209
since they kidnapped him?

214
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,338
Light, there's no mistake
that the real name

215
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:03,343
of the FBI agent who calls himself
John MacEnrow, is really Larry Conners.

216
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,178
Is that so? Thank goodness.

217
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,388
He's a real agent...

218
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,225
The director of the FBI also said
that he would help us

219
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,186
rescue director Takimura.

220
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,021
I think we can trust him.

221
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,649
<i>The director should
be dead by now...</i>

222
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,693
<i>Why don't they say anything?</i>

223
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,238
<i>Would they give up on
the deal just because he died?</i>

224
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,741
<i>I didn't think we were dealing
with such weaklings...</i>

225
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:33,122
Dad... No, everyone here
should be careful.

226
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,625
The director may not know
about the notebook,

227
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,461
but he knows who was
working with L.

228
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,588
If that gets out, there's a chance...

229
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,798
- that they'll come after us
- Light!

230
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,470
I'll be a good girl tonight and
go to sleep alone, okay?

231
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,223
Yeah, good night.

232
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,933
Good night!

233
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,477
Then I'll stay here...

234
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,607
We're not the only ones in danger.
Our families and...

235
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,276
The director's cell phone...

236
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,903
It's from the kidnappers!

237
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,614
- Aizawa!
- Yes! Tracing!

238
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,702
This is Yagami.

239
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,204
<i>Mr. Deputy Director?</i>

240
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>About the trade of the director
for the notebook...</i>

241
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,874
<i>It's canceled.</i>

242
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,709
<i>Takimura is dead.</i>

243
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,836
What?!

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,546
W- Why you!

245
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,757
<i>However, it's only canceled
with respect to the director.</i>

246
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,885
<i>We'll now trade the notebook...
for Sayu Yagami.</i>

247
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,100
<i>You're the deputy director
of the NPA...</i>

248
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,853
<i>...so it would be ridiculous for me
to tell you not to alert the police.</i>

249
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,355
<i>But I'd like it if you
move on this on your own.</i>

250
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,818
<i>I'll kill your daughter if I see
the police making too much noise.</i>

251
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,780
<i>That's right...
just like we killed the director,</i>

252
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,576
<i>I'll send you a picture of
Takimura's corpse.</i>

253
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,327
<i>Take a good long look.</i>

254
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,705
<i>I'll contact you tomorrow.</i>

255
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,248
H- Hey!

256
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,126
<i>They got me...</i>

257
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
<i>They used the death of the director
as an opportunity to get Sayu...</i>

258
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,717
Light, things are
getting fun again!

259
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,177
Sir...

260
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,554
Why would they
go this far...?

261
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,680
Damn it...!

262
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,725
YAGAMI

263
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,771
Dear, you never call from
your work phone...

264
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,523
Huh? Sayu?

265
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,609
<i>Who knows?</i>

266
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,569
<i>Come to think of it, she's late.</i>

267
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,447
Sayu...

268
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,074
BIG BROTHER

269
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,662
Dad, are you all right?

270
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,044
I think that it was Kira
who killed the director,

271
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,795
not the kidnappers.

272
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,713
<i>â€ Huh?
- What?!</i>

273
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,175
He probably doesn't want
the notebook to be passed to criminals.

274
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,344
Kira is acting as an icon of justice,

275
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,597
so he doesn't want the notebook
to fall into criminal hands.

276
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,141
If Kira killed the director...

277
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,310
it's possible that he has
methods to obtain information

278
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,229
within the police department.

279
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,732
It's best if we were
the only ones to investigate.

280
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,734
If not...

281
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,196
Kira will try to kill
the hostage again.

282
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,906
That's right.

283
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,414
Near.

284
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,710
The kidnapped director of
the Japanese NPA was killed.

285
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,462
By whom?

286
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,466
"By whom?"

287
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,718
It would be interesting
if it was Kira.

288
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,637
That's true...

289
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,766
They can't get the notebook
if their hostage is dead.

290
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
Also, if it was Kira...

291
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,105
I can narrow down the suspects.

292
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,359
By the way, Commander Rester...

293
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,736
Have you tracked his whereabouts?

294
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:55,741
Well... We're sure that he left
the institution 4 years ago as you said,

295
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,827
but we don't know anything
else after that.

296
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,787
Then it's decided.

297
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>Mello... You always overlook
the most important things</i>

298
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,546
<i>because you become too emotional.</i>

299
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,301
<i>Or maybe you're not involved
in this case at all?</i>

300
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,803
<i>How could you leave your picture
at the orphanage?</i>

301
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,516
This is Yagami.

302
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,977
<i>Your daughter has ï¬nally
arrived here.</i>

303
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,604
"Here?"

304
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,565
<i>You have a pretty good idea
of where this is, don't you?</i>

305
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,651
<i>We'll do the exchange here.</i>

306
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,113
<i>At any rate,
bring the notebook to Los Angeles,</i>

307
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,615
<i>by yourself in two days.</i>

308
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,076
I won't do the exchange unless
I make sure my daughter's safe.

309
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,745
Let me hear her voice!

310
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,496
<i>All right, all right.</i>

311
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,749
<i>I'll send you another picture.</i>

312
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,715
Sayu!

313
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,347
Sir, we've narrowed them
down to Fifth Street in Los Angeles.

314
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,266
The TV show on in the background...

315
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,186
is definitely being
broadcast right now.

316
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,814
They showed us that on purpose
to let us know she's all right...

317
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,275
T- Thank goodness...

318
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,861
At least, she's alive...

319
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,284
I'm taking the notebook
to Los Angeles.

320
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:25,539
As the deputy director of the NPA
and as Sayu Yagami's father!

321
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,043
I'll make all the decisions
and take full responsibility!

322
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,338
Dad! We have to make a plan first.

323
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,173
That's right, Sir!

324
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,634
But I have to be in Los Angeles
within two days...

325
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,843
We have no time...

326
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,518
So you're saying that it was Kira
who killed Takimura,

327
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,395
and not the kidnappers?

328
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,772
I'm just saying that
it's a possibility.

329
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,610
If so, it means Kira gained information
from the Japanese police...

330
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,076
Yes?

331
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,160
<i>This is L.</i>

332
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,414
It's L... the current one.

333
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,500
Director, I've heard what
Agent John MacEnrow...

334
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:14,672
no, Larry Conners had to say
from Deputy Director Yagami.

335
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,677
<i>Will you help us with NPA Director
Takimura's murder investigation?</i>

336
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,262
Well...

337
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,471
The phone please...

338
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,646
Nice to meet you, L Number Two.

339
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,611
"Number Two?"

340
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,280
What do you mean by that?

341
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,115
Who are you?

342
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,284
It's useless to try and hide it.

343
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,455
We are a new organization,
the SPK,

344
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,916
established to capture Kira
without the help of L.

345
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>Seven of our top members
know of L's death.</i>

346
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,759
<i>L's death...? From whom?
From where?</i>

347
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:06,974
And I am at the center of the SPK...
Let's see, call me... N.

348
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>N...? Is he joking?</i>

349
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,773
<i>But... what is...</i>

350
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,486
