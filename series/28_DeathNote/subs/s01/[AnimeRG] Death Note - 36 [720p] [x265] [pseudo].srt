<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

<i>Wanna get them mad? Get them mad?
Get them mad? People</i>

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,538
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,415
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,626
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,514
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

10
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,559
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:04,439
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,275
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

14
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

15
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,574
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,371
<i>Are you worried?</i>

18
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,297
L, I want to meet you.

19
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,924
Daikoku Wharf...

20
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,884
An abandoned warehouse
nicknamed the Yellow Box.

21
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,346
On the 28th. How about 1 PM?

22
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,931
That's fine.

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,310
<i>Take off everything you're wearing
and put it in there.</i>

24
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,562
<i>I'll give you a blanket.</i>

25
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,272
<i>Miss Takada, are you all right?!</i>

26
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,984
<i>Light, I did as you said...</i>

27
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>I made survival my ﬁrst priority...
and did it.</i>

28
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,574
<i>Come quickly... help me...</i>

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>Kiyomi Takada.
January 26, 2013, 2:32 PM.</i>

30
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>Burns to death by setting ﬁre
to everything around her</i>

31
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,378
<i>including the things she wrote on.</i>

32
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,381
<i>We are sad to announce...</i>

33
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,760
<i>The Special Police has conﬁrmed
in their autopsy report...</i>

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>that one of the bodies recovered at
the crime scene</i>

35
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,141
<i>was that of anchor, Kiyomi Takada.</i>

36
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,855
<i>A two-ton truck and a motorcycle
were found in the burnt-down church.</i>

37
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>Ofﬁcials suspect a gasoline ﬁre.</i>

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,118
<i>I'm wondering who's going to be
Kira's next spokesman?</i>

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,498
<i>Kira's voice should continue to
be broadcast to the world.</i>

40
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,418
<i>It is very unfortunate that
Anchorwoman Takada passed away, but...</i>

41
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,505
<i>I cannot help but say that
with that kind of carelessness. -.</i>

42
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,799
<i>she lacked a full appreciation for
her position as Kira's representative.</i>

43
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,760
<i>A woman is not suited
for this role.</i>

44
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,596
<i>Kira, make me your representative.</i>

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,265
KIRA'S KINGDOM

46
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,226
This is horrible...

47
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,394
Yeah...

48
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,105
As soon as they announced
that Takada was found dead...

49
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:13,235
every station has been debating over
who should be Kira's next spokesman...

50
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,698
<i>The killings last night
were carried out.</i>

51
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,493
<i>This means that Takada and
Mikami had cell phone contact...</i>

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,829
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

53
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:27,958
It's Near!

54
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,420
- L...
- Yes?

55
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,882
<i>Sorry to interrupt, but...
we're still going to meet...</i>

56
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,307
<i>On the 28th at 1 PM.
Is that still all right?</i>

57
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,643
Yes.

58
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>There's no change...
just as I thought.</i>

59
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,190
<i>There's no mistake...</i>

60
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,611
So, the day after tomorrow,
on the 28th...

61
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,239
Yes...

62
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,665
The day after tomorrow, huh?
Isn't it getting exciting?

63
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,210
Yeah... I don't know what Near
wants to show us, but...

64
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:18,925
<i>Matsuda... Ide...
We might all die... on that day.</i>

65
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,927
<i>Do you understand?</i>

66
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,055
- Gevanni.
- Yes.

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,724
Will you make it in time?

68
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,893
<i>Yes. It's not a problem.</i>

69
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,941
Commander Rester...
Lidner... Gevanni...

70
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,402
Let's do our best.

71
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,628
JANUARY 28, 2013

72
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,224
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

73
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,268
G- Good morning...

74
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,355
<i>First off...</i>

75
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:18,235
We've released Amane.
Call her for confirmation.

76
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,992
I don't know why, but I'm in
a deluxe suite at the Teito Hotel...

77
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,371
Probably as some sort
of compensation...

78
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,581
It feels great!

79
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:37,379
I see. All right.
Please stay there for a little longer.

80
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>Okay!</i>

81
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,176
Near, please get me Mogi.

82
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,137
In order to bring the notebook
we have here,

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,974
We need PIN numbers
from each of us...

84
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,185
<i>All right. I'll connect you to him.</i>

85
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,860
This is Mogi.
The number is 62-324.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,407
<i>All that's left is my number...</i>

87
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,876
<i>The Killer Notebook...</i>

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,004
<i>How to use it...</i>

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,924
<i>The human whose name is
written in this notebook shall die.</i>

90
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,885
<i>This note will not take effect</i>

91
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,178
<i>unless the writer has the person's face
in their mind when writing his/her name.</i>

92
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,808
<i>Therefore, people sharing
the same name will not be affected.</i>

93
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>If the cause of death is written...</i>

94
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>within 40 seconds of writing
the person's name, it will happen.</i>

95
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
<i>If the cause of death
is not speciﬁed,</i>

96
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,568
<i>the person will simply die
of a heart attack.</i>

97
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>After writing the cause of death,</i>

98
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:48,199
<i>details of the death should be written
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds...</i>

99
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,790
Near. I've got our notebook here.

100
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,918
I'll be bringing it with me.

101
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,047
Is it all right if Mr. Aizawa
carries it, L?

102
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,800
Near. My only concern is whether

103
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,762
you think that Aizawa
is the best one for this task.

104
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,139
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

105
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,683
<i>We'll see you at the meeting place.</i>

106
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,913
<i>It's all going to end...
no, today is just the beginning.</i>

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>The perfect world of Kira...</i>

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,923
<i>Everyone who knows about
the existence of the notebook...</i>

109
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,885
<i>...will die!</i>

110
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,105
Near is inside.
There's no mistake.

111
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,274
Well then, let's go.

112
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>Near... You're far inferior to L...</i>

113
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,977
<i>You have no right to
wear a mask of L.</i>

114
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,856
L... Those four are the SPK...

115
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,025
Near is the one wearing the mask.

116
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,612
Wait, I have a problem with this.

117
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,198
I don't care who he accuses
of being Kira...

118
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,202
but that mask proves that
he's only trying to protect himself

119
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,705
This is just for insurance.

120
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:28,461
There is a chance that everyone's face,
except mine, has been seen by Kira.

121
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,840
Kira might have written down
their names already.

122
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,177
So, for an hour... no, half an hour,

123
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,348
I want to see if anyone
falls under Kira's control or dies.

124
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,352
W- What?
He's waiting to see if we die?

125
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>He's right...
It's not impossible if Light is Kira.</i>

126
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,067
<i>Especially now,
since we're expendable...</i>

127
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,443
<i>This is just a front...
to buy some time... Near...</i>

128
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,989
<i>I never thought it would be so hard
to keep myself from laughing.</i>

129
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,117
<i>Near's probably waiting
for him to come.</i>

130
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,535
<i>I've already predicted that.</i>

131
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,794
Near! It's been over thirty minutes.
Nothing's happened.

132
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,131
Of course.
It's because Kira isn't here.

133
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,260
Fine. Everyone seems safe.

134
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,429
I'll remove my mask.

135
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,036
What's wrong, Near?

136
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,997
Are you still waiting for something?

137
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,335
Waiting... That's right.

138
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:38,633
I am waiting... for the one who
will solve everything, to arrive.

139
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,927
"The one who will
solve everything?"

140
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,639
He'll come soon.
So we must wait.

141
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,683
This building is completely sealed.

142
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,144
You can't see inside without
opening that door.

143
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,566
He'll come through that door...
or at least peek through it...

144
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,027
Who's going to come?

145
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,991
X- Kira. He's the one who is
currently killing in Kira's place...

146
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:09,372
He'll come with the notebook.
And he'll see me and write my name.

147
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,001
No, he'll probably try
to kill everyone here

148
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,919
who knows about
the notebook's existence.

149
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,259
Th-This makes no sense.
What are you talking about?!

150
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,094
Are you saying that
some third party...

151
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,639
is just going to come strolling by
with the notebook and kill us?!

152
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,850
And are you saying that we should
just let this happen?!

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,769
That's right...
Please listen.

154
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,983
If someone comes through that door,
just let him in...

155
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,029
If the door opens slightly,
act as if you don't notice.

156
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,614
Th-That's crazy. That's...!

157
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,784
He's already here.

158
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,428
LIGHT YAGAMI

159
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,608
Delete.

160
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,070
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.

161
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,116
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.
Delete!

162
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,786
Delete. Delete. Delete.

163
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,121
Delete.

164
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,539
Please do not move.

165
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,416
It's all right. You won't die.

166
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,711
- How can you be so sure, Near?!
- Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.

167
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,463
I've tampered with the notebook.

168
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,342
We took possession of the notebook
and replaced its pages.

169
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,929
The person behind the door...
who is killing for Kira...

170
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,640
has been using exactly
one page every day.

171
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,478
So I replaced the pages for today and
all subsequent days so no one will die.

172
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,398
Delete. Delete. Delete.
Delete. Delete...

173
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,400
Delete. Delete. Delete.
Delete. Delete!

174
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,818
Delete!

175
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,489
Delete!

176
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,345
X- Kira, who's beyond that door...

177
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,973
will eventually look inside...

178
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,517
to see if we're dead.

179
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,311
We can catch him when he does.

180
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,524
The one whose name isn't written
in the notebook is Kira.

181
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,864
Y- You're right... The one whose name
isn't written down would be Kira...

182
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,699
But...

183
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,630
<i>Exactly as planned!
Exactly as planned!</i>

184
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,132
<i>Exactly as planned!</i>

185
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,433
<i>Tampering with the notebook...
I knew it all along.</i>

186
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,728
<i>Near... You've been completely defeated!</i>

187
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,399
<i>The notebook you tampered with
was the fake that I had Mikami prepare!</i>

188
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,111
<i>And now, the one Mikami is
writing names in...</i>

189
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,697
<i>is the real notebook
that's been hidden!</i>

190
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,251
<i>I had Mikami make a fake notebook</i>

191
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,922
<i>and send Takada clippings
from the real one.</i>

192
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,801
<i>In other words, Takada was the one
who was really doing the killings...</i>

193
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:56,224
<i>I had Mikami write names in public,
numerous times in the fake notebook...</i>

194
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>so he would be noticed if
he was being followed.</i>

195
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>But even then, Takada was the one
who was doing the killings...</i>

196
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,733
<i>That is how I made them believe</i>

197
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,736
<i>that the Notebook that Mikami
had was the real one...</i>

198
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,534
<i>Mikami's daily behavior can
be called morbidly methodical.</i>

199
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,788
<i>He ﬁlls the notebook
with names one page a day...</i>

200
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:24,585
<i>Near. You noticed that and thought
of tampering with it.</i>

201
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,589
<i>In other words, you arranged it so that
on the day of our meeting,</i>

202
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,882
<i>the page would be on the right side.</i>

203
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,469
<i>You just had to change
the pages for that day on.</i>

204
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,888
<i>If you did,</i>

205
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,432
<i>no one would die from having
their names written in the notebook...</i>

206
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,476
<i>That was your plan!</i>

207
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,187
<i>That's why the meeting date
was not changed.</i>

208
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:48,651
<i>But I knew you were going to
tamper with the notebook, so...</i>

209
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,236
<i>I had Mikami</i>

210
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,283
I've confirmed it.

211
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,542
<i>This match was decided
at that point...</i>

212
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:10,590
<i>The notebook that Mikami brought today
is the real one I had him hide!</i>

213
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,851
<i>But Near, you had a chance.
You're soft‘...</i>

214
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,021
<i>You're nowhere as good as L...</i>

215
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>L would have noticed</i>

216
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,527
<i>there was a possibility that the notebook
was fake and would have tested it.</i>

217
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,863
<i>You had the opportunity...</i>

218
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,407
<i>I'm completely disappointed in you.</i>

219
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>This is no fun...
You tried to win too beautifully...</i>

220
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,168
<i>Well, that's ﬁne. Because of you...
Everyone's going to die.</i>

221
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,548
<i>And I, Kira will have
my perfect victory...</i>

222
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,483
To the person outside...

223
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,487
Did you write the names down
in the notebook?

224
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,156
<i>God!</i>

225
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,076
Yes, I've written them.

226
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,542
<i>No, not yet.
Don't laugh yet... hold it in...</i>

227
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,338
<i>They're all going to die 40 seconds
after he's written everyone's names...</i>

228
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,174
<i>35 seconds...</i>

229
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,094
<i>I'll claim my victory after 35 seconds...</i>

230
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,262
That's strange...

231
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,308
Why would he answer you
so earnestly

232
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,144
when you asked him if he had
written our names?

233
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,149
Who knows?
Maybe he's honest? No, he's confident?

234
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,610
Could it be that he's seen
through your plan?

235
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,905
Huh? Then that means
we're in big trouble...

236
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,740
Teru Mikami.

237
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,911
Come in if you'd like.

238
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,542
I know that you are doing
the killings for Kira.

239
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,671
There shouldn't be anything to be
afraid of if you've written our names.

240
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,297
Come right in.

241
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,593
Teru Mikami?

242
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,055
That's right.
Don't hide. Come in.

243
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,558
<i>God!</i>

244
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,165
<i>Well done, Mikami!</i>

245
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,169
How many seconds has it been since
you wrote down the first name?

246
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,847
30...

247
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,433

251
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,025
38!

252
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,526
39!

253
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,029
I win, Near!

254
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,822
40!
