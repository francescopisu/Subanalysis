1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>I'm going to change the dream</i>

7
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>Into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,465
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,635
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,671
What?!

17
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>There were another
23 heart attack victims yesterday?!</i>

18
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>As soon as we began to suspect
that Kira was a student,</i>

19
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>the timing of the killings changed as
if to contradict our theory.</i>

20
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,727
Does that mean that Kira knows
what the police know?

21
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771
When L discovers that information
from the investigation was leaked,

22
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,942
he's bound to search for leads on me
within the police force.

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,529
Someone's been following you
all this time.

24
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,825
That's a problem...

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,119
I'll get rid of him soon, Ryuk.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,080
A Shinigami's eyes...

27
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,834
...can see a human's name
and lifespan above their heads.

28
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,634
into Shinigami eyes.

29
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,845
The price for a Shinigami's eyes...

30
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,974
is half of that human's remaining lifetime.

31
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,769
So...

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,937
Light, what'll it be?

33
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,982
PURSUIT

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,235
I haven't seen Ryuk around lately...

35
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,781
Did he really lose his Death Note
in the Human World?

36
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,659
The Death Note was probably picked up
by a human before he got to it.

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,743
Couldn't be...

38
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,329
If that happened to him, he'd have to
follow that person around

39
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,332
until that person dies
or the Death Note is destroyed.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,336
Yeah... I can't picture Ryuk
doing something so tedious.

41
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,382
But I've heard that he was
carrying two Death Notes.

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,468
Seriously?
Why would he need two?

43
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,887
I have no idea what drives him to
do what he does.

44
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,974
In order for me to gain
the eyes of a Shinigami...

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,061
I have to offer half of my life.

46
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,979
Is that right?

47
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,523
Yeah.

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,774
So what'll it be?

49
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,359
Do you wanna make
a deal?

50
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,528
Ryuk.

51
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,700
This deal...
is out of the question.

52
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,172
Listen.

53
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,009
I want to create an ideal,
new world free from criminals.

54
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,471
I also intend to reign as
the god in that world for a long time.

55
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,933
I would consider it if
it lengthened my life,

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,935
but it's not worth talking
about if it's going to shorten it.

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,855
You, of all people,
should know that.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,776
Yeah, I just felt I should tell
you a deal like this exists.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,531
I don't want you to complain that
I didn't tell you about this earlier.

60
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,909
If you didn't tell me
about this earlier?

61
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,245
Don't you think
you're too late already?

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,206
You should have told me this
when we first met

63
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,127
or included this when you were writing
instructions in the Death Note...

64
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,962
Yeah. I guess you're right.

65
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,298
<i>Even though I'm a Shinigami,</i>

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>he's never been afraid of me or</i>

67
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,510
<i>tried to kiss my butt when
it comes to things like this.</i>

68
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,387
<i>He just gives me a hard time...</i>

69
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,852
Well?

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,481
You sure there isn't anything else you
want to tell me ahead of time?

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,274
Ryuk, the Shinigami?

72
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,610
Nope, there's nothing else...

73
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,236
<i>Probably...</i>

74
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,030
I see.
How disappointing.

75
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,740
"Disappointing"?

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,825
I may have seriously
considered the deal

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,119
if you offered me wings
rather than eyes.

78
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,290
Wouldn't flying around in the sky
with wings be godlike?

79
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,628
It's a dream that man
has had since ancient times.

80
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,298
You'd stand out if you sprouted
wings and started flying around.

81
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,009
I'd bet you'd get arrested
by the police just for that.

82
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,886
Ryuk, that was a joke.

83
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,725
However, if I continue to
cut deals for eyes and wings...

84
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,394
I'm going to end up becoming
a real Shinigami.

85
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,481
That could be amusing,
don't you think?

86
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,733
Don't worry.

87
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,028
Even without all that,
you're already...

88
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,447
a fine Shinigami!

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,701
The Shinigami Realm is
rotten these days.

90
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:31,623
They all live vacant lives
and only take human lives...

91
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,334
just because they don't want to die.

92
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
No one even knows...

93
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,464
why we exist.

94
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,426
I doubt there's any reason
at all for our existence.

95
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:50,141
You're much more of
a Shinigami than they are.

96
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,564
Well, from what you're saying, it sounds
like I'm doing a lot more work.

97
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,775
But don't lump me together
with the Shinigami.

98
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,613
I am using this Death Note
as a human for humans.

99
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,951
But, I wouldn't say that
the Shinigami Realm

100
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,579
is meaningless to humans either.

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,664
What do you mean?

102
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,457
Well, think about it.

103
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,294
Whenever a Shinigami like you
comes to the Human World

104
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,213
once every hundred, no,
every thousand years,

105
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,382
the Human World
changes greatly.

106
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,303
The Shinigami Realm's existence
is fear-fully meaningful.

107
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,096
I- Is that so?

108
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,683
You just told me that
the Shinigami Realm is rotten.

109
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,351
When you return there,
from this world,

110
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,521
how about using what you've
learned here to try to change it?

111
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:43,695
Light... you just may be
quite the positive thinker.

112
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,740
Of course, I am.

113
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,868
If I wasn't, I wouldn't be
trying to use

114
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,704
the Death Note to try and
make the world a better place.

115
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,375
That's it!

116
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,711
I've got it!

117
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,339
What's up?
What did you get?

118
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,762
How to find out the name of
the guy who was following me today.

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,472
How are you going to do it?

120
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,724
I'm going to use the rules of
the Death Note to my advantage.

121
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,643
If I write the cause of death...

122
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,519
I have an additional
6 minutes and 40 seconds

123
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,689
to record specific conditions
and time of death.

124
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,903
I wonder how free I can
be with these conditions?

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,197
I'm going to test it out.

126
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,200
THE FOLLOWING MORNING

127
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,287
Yes, it's me.

128
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,583
Another six inmates?

129
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,460
All heart attacks?!

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,920
It's Kira.

131
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,630
What?

132
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,300
Three of them exhibited bizarre behavior
before they died?!

133
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,302
What do you mean?!

134
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,096
They didn't just die from
simple heart attacks?

135
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,517
Well, they died of heart attacks,
but before one of them died...

136
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,521
he drew a strange symbol
on the wall with blood from his finger.

137
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,149
Another left a letter that doesn't seem
like a will or anything meaningful.

138
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,446
The third escaped just to go
to the employee bathroom.

139
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,496
Watari, what is it?

140
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,709
<i>More victims, but their circumstances
are unlike those we've had before.</i>

141
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,128
Unlike those before?

142
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,965
<i>I shall send you an image of
the picture and letter left at the scene.</i>

143
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,174
If you could.

144
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,470
<i>A note describing a fear of Kira.</i>

145
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,976
<i>This can be taken as
something a criminal might do, but...</i>

146
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,146
<i>Kira can control the time of death.</i>

147
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,858
<i>If he can control actions
right before death as well...</i>

148
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,192
<i>that would mean that...</i>

149
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,695
<i>Chief!</i>

150
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,657
<i>Regarding these current victims.</i>

151
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>Don't let the media know anything</i>

152
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,162
<i>aside from the fact that
they died of heart attacks.</i>

153
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>It's possible that Kira
was performing some kind of test.</i>

154
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:07,297
<i>If that's the case, we'd only
be giving him the results.</i>

155
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,923
I see...

156
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,675
|- | understand.

157
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,428
Performing tests on criminals?

158
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,721
That's horrible...

159
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,099
He's playing with peoples' lives
as if this is a game.

160
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,517
This is unforgivable!

161
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>If Kira is using criminals
as test subjects...</i>

162
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,151
<i>What is he trying to achieve?</i>

163
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,077
Look at this, Ryuk.

164
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:42,332
The results of yesterday's test have
already been input into Dad's computer.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,334
KIDNAPPING MURDER

166
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,628
KIDNAPPING MURDER

167
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,630
What do you mean by that?

168
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,507
One escaped...

169
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,675
and went to the bathroom
I had designated in the Death Note.

170
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,388
Another drew the same symbol
I had drawn in the Death Note.

171
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,231
These three did exactly what I wanted.

172
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,111
I purposely wrote very difficult tasks
for the other three.

173
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,199
DIES IN FRONT OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER FRANCE, TODAY AT 6 P.M.

174
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,539
It's physically impossible to go from
a prison in Japan to France in an hour.

175
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,209
So this never happened and ended
as just a regular heart attack.

176
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:31,881
The next was to "draw a picture of L's face
on the prison wall," but...

177
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,843
One can't draw the faces...
of people they don't know.

178
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,386
I see.

179
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,055
HEART ATTACK WRITES A NOTE STATING "I KNOW
THAT L IS SUSPICIOUS OF THE JAPANESE POLICE." DIES AT 6 P.M.

180
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,440
I thought this one might work,
but it didn't happen.

181
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,318
Which means that people can't write

182
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:57,198
about things they don't know or things
they didn't come up with on their own.

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,536
In short, it means that even
the Death Note can't do the impossible.

184
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,416
But as long as it's something
the person is realistically likely to do,

185
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,627
I can control them as much as
I want before he dies.

186
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,129
You've figured that out...

187
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,674
But what are you trying to do, Light?

188
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,262
L and the police will never
figure out my true goal.

189
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,055
The great detective
is probably trying

190
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,685
to decipher the picture and
the letter those criminals left.

191
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,397
<i>They're absolutely meaningless
fnal words...</i>

192
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:37,405
<i>If Kira used those criminals as guinea pigs,
he's about to start something.</i>

193
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,743
<i>If he moves now,
there is the chance that...</i>

194
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,495
<i>the FBI will notice someone
acting suspiciously.</i>

195
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,209
<i>But if he has a different goal in mind...</i>

196
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>the letter and picture might
be some kind of message...</i>

197
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
<i>Is this it?</i>

198
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,176
L DO YOU KNOW

199
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,886
Well... It's time for the main act.

200
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,429
The "main act"?

201
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,306
Yesterday on the news...

202
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,475
There was a drug addict who tried
to rob a bank,

203
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,893
WANTED CRIMINAL
KIICHIRO OSOREDA

204
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,146
I'll use him.

205
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,941
It's last minute, but I'm sure
I can find someone...

206
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,068
I'll try to ask out a few.

207
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,362
Ask out... "a few"?

208
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,325
Yeah... Ryuk, I may not look it,
but I'm pretty popular.

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:36,631
Hello? Huh, Light?
Good morning...

210
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,154
<i>He's still following me, isn't he?</i>

211
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,781
<i>That's perfect.</i>

212
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,658
<i>If my shadow wasn't here,</i>

213
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,160
<i>there would be no point in what
I'm going to do next.</i>

214
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,459
Light!

215
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,461
- A date?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,339
It's a date,
no matter how you look at it.

217
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,342
Even to my shadow...

218
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,344
It's not a normal date, is it?

219
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,056
You said you found a way
to find out your shadow's name, but...

220
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,018
What do you plan to do?

221
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:35,148
Huh? Ryuk, didn't you see
what I wrote in the Death Note?

222
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,401
Nah. It would be boring to peek.

223
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,070
Then just be patient and
watch what happens.

224
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,700
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

225
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,368
No, not at all!

226
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,580
Anyway, I haven't been to
Space Land since junior high!

227
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,709
I'm so excited!
And I get to be alone with you!

228
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,044
Y- Yeah.

229
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,716
<i>On weekdays, he only goes
to school and his prep courses.</i>

230
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,095
<i>An occasional date on his days off.
He's a normal...</i>

231
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,890
<i>...no, he is a serious
high school student.</i>

232
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,060
<i>Light Yagami, son of Chief Yagami...</i>

233
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,354
<i>No grounds for suspicion.</i>

234
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,107
<i>At any rate...</i>

235
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>Today is my last day of
following him.</i>

236
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,617
Light...

237
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,620
Didn't you say that you weren't going out
until entrance exams were over?

238
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,123
Yeah, but I did score number one
in the practice exams.

239
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,583
Your attitude's awful!

240
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,494
<i>It's him! He's here!</i>

241
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>Aside from him,
there are seven passengers.</i>

242
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,794
<i>This is going to work out perfectly.</i>

243
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,966
I'm taking control of this bus!

244
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,470
<i>A hijacking!
At a time like this?</i>

245
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,808
Don't make a fuss!
I'll kill anyone that moves.

246
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:39,188
Driver, you know the phone number
for Space Land's offices, don't you?

247
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,648
- Call them!
- Yes...

248
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,861
T- This is Sasaki, the driver of
bus number 174!

249
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,155
Tell them what's happening!

250
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,284
An armed man has
hijacked our bus!

251
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,452
Give me that.

252
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,037
You hear that? Listen carefully.

253
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,375
Bring Space Land's profits from yesterday
to two bus stops away from there.

254
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,043
Have a woman bring it
by car, alone!

255
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,880
Do it before this bus gets there!

256
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,339
If you try anything funny...

257
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,802
or call the police,
I'll kill all the passengers one by one!

258
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,896
<i>Yuri, don't worry.</i>

259
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,190
<i>I'll look for the chance
to grab his hand...</i>

260
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>that's holding the pistol.</i>

261
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,735
That's dangerous. Don't do it.

262
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,862
If it comes to that, I'll do it.

263
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,200
It's all right.
We don't have to pass notes.

264
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,162
As long as we whisper, he won't hear us
over the sound of the bus.

265
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,876
Do you have proof that
you're not his accomplice?

266
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,545
A- Accomplice?

267
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,880
It's pretty common.

268
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,842
The culprit pretends he's alone
and just in case...

269
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,595
he'll leave someone to
keep watch in the back.

270
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,015
What's wrong?

271
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,059
Oh no, do you really think...?

272
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,186
<i>I- I have no choice.</i>

273
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,605
<i>There is no way that
Light Yagami could be Kira.</i>

274
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,733
<i>Kira could kill the culprit
with a heart attack.</i>

275
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,070
Here's proof.
Take a look.

276
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,697
<i>FBI?!</i>

277
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:17,745
<i>I see, L's using the FBI to investigate
those connected to the Japanese police force!</i>

278
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,915
<i>His name is...
Raye Penber.</i>

279
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,752
I trust you.

280
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:30,466
I won't ask why an FBI agent
is on board with us... but...

281
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,635
- Do you have a gun?
- Yes, I do.

282
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,055
So if something happens,
I can rely on you, right?

283
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,306
Yes.

284
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,225
Shut up!

285
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,935
Do you want me to beat you to death?

286
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,565
<i>That man! He was on
the Japanese news two days ago.</i>

287
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,317
<i>He's a drug addict who tried
to rob a bank,</i>

288
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,736
<i>killed three civilians,
and ran away.</i>

289
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,072
<i>He's very dangerous.</i>

290
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,660
<i>Every thing will be all right.
He'll never point his gun at us.</i>

291
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,998
Hey, you! Don't move.

292
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,835
What's that piece of paper?

293
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,253
Hey you!

294
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,964
You were planning something back here
with notes, weren't you?

295
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,299
<i>Not good!</i>

296
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,675
<i>If he sees that note from earlier...</i>

297
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,178
<i>He'll discover that Light was planning
to jump him when he had the chance!</i>

298
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,016
MINAMI PARK BUS STOP 11:27

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,687
<i>All right!</i>

300
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,363
W- Who the hell are you?!

301
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:39,785
You in the back!
W- What are you trying to pull?

302
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,330
H- How long were you
hiding back there?!

303
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:48,502
Huh? You mean me?
You can see me right now?

304
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,838
D- Don't move!

305
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,715
I- I'll shoot!
You monster!

306
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,842
<i>This isn't good!
He's hallucinating!</i>

307
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,218
Everyone, get down!

308
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,640
Oh, I get it!

309
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,226
That note that Light just dropped...

310
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,313
was cut out of the Death Note.

311
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,860
He has this guy touch the note
and how, only he can see me.

312
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,737
That's so smart.

313
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,197
D- Don't come near me!

314
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,201
Sorry, pal.

315
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,496
I'm a Shinigami,
so that's not gonna kill me.

316
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,095
"Anyone who touches the Death Note
will be able to see me...

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,723

319

That's all stuff I've told Light...

320
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,690
Pretty impressive,
how he put it all together.

321
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,401
It's not surprising he's the nation's top
exam scorer...

322
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,611
He even used this hijacking

323
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,697
to get the name of the guy
who was following him...

324
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,115
without a lot of hassle.

325
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,576

00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,424
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

342
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

343
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

344
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:57,441
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

345
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,613
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

346
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

347
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,496
<i>To accomplish</i>

348
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

349
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:25,970
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

350
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,767
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

351
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,690
PREVIEW

352
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,109
I REQUEST THAT THE FOLLOWING EVENTS
REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN THE EIGHT OF US.

353
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,114
The remaining agents will
all die of heart attacks.

354
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,200
Farewell, Raye Penber.

355
