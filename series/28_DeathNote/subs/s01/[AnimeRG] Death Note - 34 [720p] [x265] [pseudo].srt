<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,496
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

10
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

15
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,288
<i>Are you worried?</i>

21
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,049
I'm going to announce my engagement
to him at the Pop Music Festival.

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:36,847
I used to like Kira as well,
but Light's going to catch him soon.

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,434
You'll probably get executed.

24
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:46,273
Send me a fan letter that
I can tell is from you.

25
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,484
Place within it
five blank notebook pages.

26
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,822
<i>Continue killing as usual
until I receive them.</i>

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,991
What about after you receive them?

28
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,161
Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as possible...

29
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,705
and act as if you're killing
using the fake.

30
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,583
What's up with that, lady?

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,210
You're wearing such a short skirt
even though it's winter...

32
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,420
S- Someone-!

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,177
Delete...

34
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,595
Mikami's getting off.

35
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,897
VIGILANCE

36
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,941
A man who was harassing
a woman collapsed.

37
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,444
He was in the same train car
as Mikami.

38
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,573
It happened a few seconds after
Mikami wrote something in a notebook.

39
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,116
It's probably...

40
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,160
Now we're sure.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,912
MIKAMI

42
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,208
First, we've got to get as close
as possible to Mikami.

43
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,419
But there's something
we need to be careful of.

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,798
That is the existence
of the Shinigami.

45
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,926
We must assume that if the Shinigami
discovers that we're following him,

46
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,136
he'll alert Mikami.

47
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,475
But the Shinigami can only be seen
by those who have touched the notebook.

48
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,187
Being careful of something
you can't see is difficult.

49
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,107
Even if it's difficult, please do it.

50
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,360
I understand.

51
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,912
<i>Light is going to meet Takada
again in this room today.</i>

52
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,915
<i>As soon as they began
their secret meeting...</i>

53
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,959
<i>Takada received a phone call
from Kira...</i>

54
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,253
<i>and the surveillance cameras
were removed.</i>

55
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,840
<i>The ﬁrst thought
that hit me was that...</i>

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>They could communicate
by writing messages...</i>

57
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,178
It looks fine.

58
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,475
There's nothing in this room
other than the wire on me.

59
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,937
Y- Yeah. All that's left
is the bathroom.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,195
<i>Why does Light care so much
about cameras and wiretaps?</i>

61
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>No, why is Kira allowing this
secret meeting to go on?</i>

62
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,077
<i>Something doesn't add up...</i>

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,586
<i>In the event that
they are writing notes...</i>

64
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,171
<i>The only thing that I can do is...</i>

65
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,679
Light...

66
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,266
I talked to Miss Amane
yesterday, alone.

67
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,893
About what?

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,771
Light's in trouble now!

69
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,815
Matsuda, you seem kind of happy.

70
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,860
Miss Amane said that she was going to
announce her engagement to you at...

71
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,029
the Pop Music Festival.

72
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,739
"WHAT IS MISA TO YOU?"

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,241
Trouble, trouble! Big trouble!

74
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,534
Matsuda, shut up!

75
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,622
Well, I just haven't been able
to break it to her.

76
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,832
She's nothing to me already...

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>That Misa,
always making things difﬁcult...</i>

78
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,632
<i>No, it's Takada as well.
Why are women so...?!</i>

79
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,053
<i>“Already?” Is that true?</i>

80
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,392
<i>She was in charge of
Kira's killing before T.</i>

81
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:15,357
<i>She gained Kira's power somehow
and discovered that I was Kira.</i>

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,483
<i>It couldn't be helped.</i>

83
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,862
<i>There would be no other reason why
I would choose such an impulsive woman.</i>

84
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>Amane was doing Kira's killings.
But right now, it's me.</i>

85
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>He had no choice with Amane.</i>

86
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,207
<i>But Yagami chose me.</i>

87
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,254
Miss Takada, believe me.
You're the only one for me now.

88
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,214
"You're the only one for me now?"

89
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,759
That's so unlike you,
such a predictable line...

90
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,594
It's definitely unlike Light...

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,596
<i>- to give such a brutal excuse.
- Those are my honest feelings.</i>

92
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,432
<i>- So, Amane or Takada. Which one is it?
- / Wonder how man y Women...</i>

93
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,642
<i>you've said that to?</i>

94
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,519
<i>- Well... He might be dating both.
- Takada, do you really think. -.</i>

95
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,895
<i>- Two-timing?
- I'm that kind Of guy?</i>

96
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,438
Do you think that's acceptable?!

97
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,898
<i>- Hey, I'm not the one...!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...</i>

98
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,149
Shut up!

99
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,990
It depends on you from now on,
but I'll trust you.

100
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,952
But I'll make things hell for you
if you're lying.

101
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,913
I'll tell Kira.

102
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,166
Kira, huh?

103
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,920
I know that the world needs
Kira right now,

104
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,922
but I've been thinking.

105
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,593
I wonder if I'll ever
be together with you...

106
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,012
In other words, I hate Kira

107
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,556
because he chose you as
his spokesperson...

108
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,060
It's fine if he kills criminals,
but We're not criminals...

109
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,730
We should have the right
to be happy.

110
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,612
"Together, peacefully and happily. "

111
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:48,658
TOGETHER, PEACEFULLY AND
HAPPILY. BUT THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN IF KIRA WASN'T AROUND.

112
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,495
Yeah. If only Kira wasn't around.

113
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,665
KIRA SHOULD BE ARRESTED.

114
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,709
"Kira should be arrested. "

115
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,715
You're right.

116
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,718
Kira needs to be arrested.

117
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,678
In order for us to be happy.

118
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,308
Miss Takada, are you serious?

119
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
Yes.

120
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,355
<i>But I'll need your help for that.</i>

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,814
<i>You'll be putting yourself in danger.</i>

122
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,108
I'll be defying the police,

123
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,820
and you'll be going against Kira
and the whole world.

124
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,366
Is that... all right with you?

125
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,960
Th-That's one long pause...

126
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,381
<i>It's ﬁne.</i>

127
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:50,303
"I'll help you if it means that
we can be happy together..

128
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,888
That's a big turn in our favor!

129
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,640
Just as I expected of Light!

130
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,475
He brought the conversation
from two-timing on Misa-Misa

131
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,269
to getting Takki to help him!

132
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,149
<i>Mikami is talking to himself!</i>

133
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,818
To himself?

134
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,696
<i>Yes. He's too far away for me
to record his voice...</i>

135
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>But I've got visuals of his mouth!</i>

136
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,827
<i>This is footage of Mikami
during his break at work...</i>

137
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,288
<i>Right here. He's saying something.</i>

138
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,416
Show it once more to us
in slow motion.

139
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,095
Shi... ni... ga... mi, huh?

140
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,346
But...

141
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>He seems to have reacted
to the scrap of paper at his feet.</i>

142
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
He just gave a small sigh.

143
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>He talks a bit more here.
I'll zoom in on his mouth.</i>

144
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,571
That... Shi... ni... ga... mi...

145
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:55,160
Just... gave... me...
the... note... book...

146
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,497
And... hasn't... appeared... since...

147
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,921
"That Shinigami just
gave me the notebook...

148
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,631
"and hasn't appeared since..

149
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,013
Mikami was given the notebook
by a Shinigami.

150
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,725
But the Shinigami hasn't
been following him.

151
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,272
I see...

152
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,987
Then I guess that'll be it for today...

153
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,781
Yeah...

154
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,826
It's finally over.

155
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,995
Today was really quite amazing.

156
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,498
It's tough to do this for several hours.

157
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,708
But you're still smiling.

158
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,795
Then I'll go to the hotel and checkout.

159
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,005
Thanks for your help!

160
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,965
Must be tough for Aizawa,

161
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,052
making all the reservations
and checking out of the hotels.

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,748
<i>It's gone... The mark I made
with my nail is gone!</i>

163
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>Two of the four marks
I left are gone...</i>

164
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,638
<i>The room is the way they left it.</i>

165
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,683
<i>The hotel staff hasn't come in yet...</i>

166
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,396
<i>So why has the notepad
been switched with a new one?</i>

167
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,984
<i>They're... passing notes!</i>

168
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,490
Yes?

169
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,621
What? You want to meet and talk
to Near directly?

170
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,756
Mr. Aizawa, it's been a while.

171
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,092
And also... nice to meet you.

172
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,971
There's no point in saying that
if I'm blindfolded.

173
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,891
He doesn't have any weapons
or cameras on him.

174
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,102
Then you can take off the blindfold.

175
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,321
Near, I believe you.

176
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,616
L and Takada are meeting
almost every night.

177
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
I know.

178
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,786
Then what about this?

179
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,331
There's no mistake that
they're passing notes!

180
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,586
Mr. Aizawa, please don't do
anything unnecessary.

181
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,379
"Do anything unnecessary?"

182
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,299
Yes. It's no longer a matter

183
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,469
of simply finding
evidence against Kira.

184
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:05,475
We must hit Kira with complete defeat
in order to stop him.

185
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,978
Mr. Aizawa, I'll say this bluntly.

186
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,315
You and the task force are
no longer a part of this battle.

187
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,196
But if you still want
to capture Kira,

188
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,741
just keep an eye on him,
as you've been doing.

189
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,993
Just keep an eye on him?

190
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,831
Yes. But there is a purpose
to keeping watch over L.

191
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,794
And that's part of my plan.

192
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,839
I want you to cooperate that way.

193
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,300
In order to win against Kira...

194
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,844
And watch...

195
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,223
the end of Kira.

196
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,909
<i>There's only a few minutes
left of this year,</i>

197
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>one that's been one full of
breakthroughs for me.</i>

198
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,462
<i>I'm Kiyomi Takada, your host.
Thank you very much for everything.</i>

199
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,674
The Pop Song Festival is
about to begin!

200
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,469
Matsuda, have you crosschecked
the Kira murders and the victims?

201
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,975
After Misa-Misa's performance!
She's this year's opening act!

202
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,065
W- What is it...?

203
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,279
We're the SPK...

204
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,448
We want you to come with us.

205
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,872
<i>I must apologize to everyone.</i>

206
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:57,587
<i>Unfortunately, this year's opener,
Misa Amane, has not arrived yet.</i>

207
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,506
<i>However...</i>

208
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,300
<i>- What's going on?
- unexpected things can happen...</i>

209
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,677
<i>- Mogi didn't tell me anything about this.
- at' the Pop Song F est/val.</i>

210
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,807
Go back to NHN immediately!

211
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:14,354
I'm already known as the queen
of last-minute cancellations!

212
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,106
Misa-Misa, stay calm.

213
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,941
Mochi, why?!

214
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,027
We need to do this to catch Kira.

215
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,654
That doesn't involve me!

216
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,158
If worse came to worst,
I was prepared to pull a gun on you...

217
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,371
But I'm glad that
you didn't resist, Mr. Mogi.

218
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,043
<i>I probably would have resisted if
I hadn't listened to what Aizawa said...</i>

219
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,798
<i>But hearing about the notepad,
there's no doubt that...</i>

220
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,927
What's going on?

221
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,721
Near.

222
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,264
<i>What is it, L?</i>

223
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,267
Mogi and Misa Amane
have gone missing.

224
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,438
<i>Yes. I've taken them
into my custody.</i>

225
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,107
What for?!

226
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,400
Why?

227
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,819
Just in case.

228
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>Near...</i>

229
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,368
Kidnapping and confinement
is a crime. Stop this immediately.

230
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>Well, Mr. Mogi and Amane
agreed to cooperate.</i>

231
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,584
I'll put them on the line.
Here you go.

232
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>Mogi, Misa, this is L.</i>

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,385
<i>Light!</i>

234
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,679
<i>It seems that Near's detaining you.</i>

235
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,306
Is it true that you agreed to it?

236
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:36,978
Yes...

237
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,729
<i>Mogi...</i>

238
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>I was against it!</i>

239
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,694
<i>But Mochi said it would
be better if we did as they said.</i>

240
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,780
<i>He said that we would
be killed if I didn't...</i>

241
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,909
I understand.
I guess it's fine if you both agreed.

242
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,915
<i>For the time being
I'm excluding Amane,</i>

243
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,668
<i>who was suspected of being
the Second Kira.</i>

244
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,962
Light Yagami...

245
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,674
You should know what
this action means...

246
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,052
<i>No way]</i>

247
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,221
<i>You're planning to end this
without Misa-Misa performing?!</i>

248
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,431
<i>Bring Misa-Misa out!</i>

249
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,475
Looks like Lidner and
the others succeeded.

250
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,936
<i>It's past nine...</i>

251
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,897
<i>All right, now it's my turn...</i>

252
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,640
The time that Mikami leaves work
differs only slightly.

253
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,143
He leads a completely routine life.

254
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,438
So he always goes to
that gym every week

255
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,691
on Monday and Thursday until 21:00?

256
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,736
<i>Yes. He's come at that time
for the past four years,</i>

257
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,279
<i>ever since he joined.</i>

258
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,406
<i>He hasn't even skipped
New Year's Day.</i>

259
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,618
<i>I became a member to conﬁrm it.</i>

260
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,541
Then can we assume that
he's going this 31st?

261
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,668
<i>Yes. He's someone who would
go on New Year's Day.</i>

262
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,462
<i>He's sure to go
on New Year's Eve, too.</i>

263
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,756
Gevanni.

264
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,427
Is it possible for you to touch
the notebook on the 31st at the gym?

265
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,808
Yes. I've already checked
the hotel's security.

266
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,311
There are no surveillance
cameras in the locker room.

267
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,813
<i>Then I'll ask you to do it.</i>

268
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,276
There's a possibility that I'll die

269
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,903
if there's a Shinigami with him,
isn't there?

270
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,572
<i>Yes.</i>

271
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,449
We need to confirm it.
That is why I'm asking you to do it.

272
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,537
Even if you don't see
a Shinigami after touching it...

273
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,872
I want you to continue to
watch him for a while

274
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,251
to see whether there is one with him.

275
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,422
<i>I'll have Rester do it
if you're too scared.</i>

276
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,509
I understand. I'll do it.

277
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:38,534
<i>If a Shinigami is with him...
No, I'm already here...</i>

278
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,870
<i>I have to touch it...</i>

279
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,069
<i>I have successfully touched
the notebook!</i>

280
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,906
<i>I cannot conﬁrm any Shinigami
at this time.</i>

281
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,243
Commander Rester,
connect me to Mr. Mogi.

282
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,082
Mr. Mogi. According to
the notebook's rules,

283
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,377
how long can a person be
controlled before death?

284
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,840
23 days, judging by the data from
Yotsuba's experiments.

285
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,467
<i>Are you sure?</i>

286
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,971
Yes. I think that Yotsuba's killings
have proven that.

287
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,932
Thank you very much.

288
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:49,438
Then it is possible that Gevanni
is already being controlled...

289
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,400
and is being made to say
that there is no Shinigami...

290
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,111
I'm going to confront L...

291
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,365
if Gevanni is still alive
24 days from now.

292
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,958
JANUARY 3

293
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,753
Yes. To think that
Amane would go missing...

294
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,173
<i>"Give T the order to tell you...</i>

295
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,175
<i>"once everything has been conﬁrmed.</i>

296
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,302
<i>"Once you get the message,</i>

297
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,388
<i>"send me a text message
or something...</i>

298
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,474
<i>"that says you want
to meet me quickly. "</i>

299
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,686
JANUARY 6

300
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,898
A photograph?

301
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,236
Yes. I want to see how it's written.

302
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,239
Any patterns as to
how it's being written,

303
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,826
if there are any quirks,
and what kind of notebook it is...

304
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,080
I want to see everything in detail
with my own eyes.

305
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,347
What do you think, Near?

306
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,101
Yes, Gevanni has done well.

307
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,603
The handwriting matches

308
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,230
that of Mikami's records
he wrote as a prosecutor.

309
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,233
This is definitely
Mikami's handwriting.

310
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,568
Yes.

311
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,361
We can do this...
