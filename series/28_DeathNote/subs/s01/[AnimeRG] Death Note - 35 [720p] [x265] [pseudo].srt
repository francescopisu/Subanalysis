Near, it went well.

23
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,428
I did everything that
you told me to do.

24
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,846
<i>Yes...</i>

25
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,943
MATSUMOTO

00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,366

27
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,952
That is all I have to tell you today.

28
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>Very well.</i>

29
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,458
I also have something
I want to tell you.

30
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>Yes.</i>

31
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,461
I've confirmed it.

32
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,723
Hm? A text message?

33
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,185
I WANT TO SEE YOU

34
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,395
I'm so jealous!

35
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,816
<i>I did it! That's the conﬁrmation
from Mikami.</i>

36
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,737
<i>I just have to wait for Near
to ask to meet me.</i>

37
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,615
<i>Near... I win!</i>

38
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,660
<i>I predicted what your plan was
going to be from the beginning!</i>

39
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,079
<i>This is Gevanni.</i>

40
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,373
<i>Near, I've checked the notebook.</i>

41
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,126
<i>For the past three days,</i>

42
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,670
<i>he's ﬁlled out one page every night
past midnight as he usually does.</i>

43
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,339
<i>The victims match up.</i>

44
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,217
<i>There's no change in
Mikami's behavior.</i>

45
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,135
I understand.

46
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,971
Then let's begin.

47
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,772
It's Near!

48
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,190
<i>He called!</i>

49
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,525
<i>L.</i>

50
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,693
What is it, Near?

51
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,487
<i>I want to meet you.</i>

52
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,447
What?

53
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,368
<i>I must meet you to discuss
the Kira case.</i>

54
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,955
But don't you suspect me
of being Kira?

55
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,833
You shouldn't want to meet me.

56
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:39,756
<i>Well, there's something that
I must show you personally.</i>

57
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,092
<i>Everything will be resolved
once I do that.</i>

58
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:48,014
Good. I want you to realize that
you're wrong about me.

59
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,726
<i>Near wants to prove Light is Kira,
and Light wants to kill Near...</i>

60
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:58,900
<i>The time has ﬁnally come...</i>

61
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,695
<i>Let's agree on some rules
regarding our meeting...</i>

62
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,656
Yes. Anything.

63
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,867
First...

64
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,161
All of our investigators
must be there...

65
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,250
In other words, everyone who
is looking for Kira will gather.

66
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,836
<i>I understand. That's ﬁne.</i>

67
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,297
As I said before,

68
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,676
there are a total of four SPK members,
including myself.

69
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,264
Mr. Mogi, who is here,
will accompany us.

70
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,475
Amane will be released
right before we meet.

71
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,728
She will not be told where
we'll be heading.

72
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,107
We shall meet you once you confirm
that Amane has been released.

73
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:40,859
How about it?

74
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,485
What should we do?

75
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,030
Near, I understand.

76
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,074
We have five investigators,
including myself...

77
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,537
No, Mogi is with you,
so aside from me, there are three.

78
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,333
Very well...
Now about our meeting place...

79
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,631
<i>Daikoku Wharf.</i>

80
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>An abandoned warehouse...</i>

81
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,427
<i>on the outskirts of
the South East side...</i>

82
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,429
<i>Nicknamed the Yellow Box.</i>

83
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,559
<i>I've already taken
the liberty of buying it.</i>

84
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,062
<i>How about that, Light Yagami?</i>

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,482
<i>You should be able to
put your plan into action here.</i>

86
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,567
One more thing.

87
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,027
I want you to bring

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,947
the notebook you have at
your headquarters, with you.

89
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,366
Why the notebook?

90
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,867
<i>A simple reason.</i>

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,206
There's no one to guard the notebook
if everyone leaves.

92
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,085
I promise you.
I won't try to steal it.

93
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,587
I won't even touch it.

94
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>I'll place my faith in you</i>

95
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,927
<i>if Mr. Aizawa can conﬁrm that it's
the notebook from your headquarters.</i>

96
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,304
All right.

97
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,849
<i>But someone other than L
will hold onto it.</i>

98
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,144
<i>Because I believe that L is Kira.</i>

99
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,608
I understand. But I will decide
who holds onto it. Is that all right?

100
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,445
<i>Yes. Then all that's left
is the time and date.</i>

101
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,782
<i>The time and date...
the question is what time.</i>

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,244
<i>Mikami kills right after midnight.</i>

103
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
<i>In the morning, he'll probably receive
a notice of the people to kill.</i>

104
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,666
<i>Taking his movements
into consideration...</i>

105
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,423
In three days...
On the 28th. How about 1 PM?

106
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>One o'clock, huh?</i>

107
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,760
<i>Just as I expected...</i>

108
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,055
<i>Near is calculating
Mikami's movements...</i>

109
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,393
That's fine.
It doesn't matter what time it is.

110
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,938
Then three days from now
at one o'clock.

111
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,273
<i>Yes.</i>

112
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,317
<i>Near.</i>

113
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>Light Yagami.</i>

114
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,363
<i>- I know what your plan is!
- I know what your plan is!</i>

115
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,657
<i>- I'm going to win!
- I'm going to win!</i>

116
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,000
Sorry, Miss Takada.
I'm a little busy today...

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,503
Busy? Does that mean that
you can't stay until morning?

118
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,338
Yeah, sorry.

119
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,550
The police are going to have
their hands full for two to three days.

120
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,385
How unfortunate...

121
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,267
<i>I've already given orders
to Mikami and Takada...</i>

122
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>This is the last order
I'll be giving...</i>

123
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,064
JANUARY 281:00 PM
DAIKOKU WHARF WAREHOUSE

124
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
It's a rebel!
Protect Miss Takada!

125
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,535
Miss Takada, are you all right?

126
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,786
Yes.

127
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,789
He's getting away! Follow him!

128
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,208
Miss Takada, please
get inside NHN quickly!

129
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,253
Don't! If someone like that
was just here...

130
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,005
It's too dangerous
in or around NHN!

131
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>Mello!</i>

132
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,093
At any rate, you should
get away from here!

133
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,137
Lady Takada, please get on!

134
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:39,973
Quickly!

135
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,599
Lady Takada, it's all right.

136
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,518
Get on quickly and
get out of here.

137
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,686
Yes...

138
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,653
Team A, Team B,
follow Lady Takada by car.

139
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,156
The other teams, go after
the car that just sped off!

140
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,252
All right! We've confirmed her safety.

141
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,171
Get Lady Takada
to car number seven.

142
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,805
No! He's taking Lady Takada?!

143
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,057
Damn it!

144
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,518
You idiot! Stop!

145
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,312
What if you hit Lady Takada?!

146
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,191
W- What are you doing?!

147
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,128
<i>One of them is heavily armed...</i>

148
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,758
NHN NEWS
TAKADA KIDNAPPED IN FRONT OF NHN?

149
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,302
<i>- Th-This is really bad...
- As reported Ledy Tekeda and her escort team...</i>

150
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,887
Is it Near again?

151
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,724
<i>Near, you promised that
we'd meet three days from now.</i>

152
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,727
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>

153
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,147
<i>No, this isn't his style.
It's more like...</i>

154
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,399
It's Near!

155
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,965
<i>So the cars
got ahead of me, huh?</i>

156
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,134
<i>How many escorts
does that Takada have?</i>

157
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,055
Come on!

158
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,685
Since when were the Japanese
allowed to carry such big guns?

159
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,980
I'm an accomplice in
the kidnapping of Miss Takada.

160
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,856
You've probably got
a lot of questions for me...

161
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:55,984
You won't shoot-!

162
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,792
Idiot. He probably wouldn't
have told us anything anyway.

163
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,714
Death is the only way to
pay for crimes against Kira.

164
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,304
<i>He's...</i>

165
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,475
<i>The person that Yagami warned me
to be most careful of. Mello...</i>

166
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,103
<i>Mihael Keehl...</i>

167
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,844
Take off everything you're wearing
and put it in there.

168
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,559
Huff)’-

169
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,936
I'll give you a blanket.

170
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,611
<i>L, the one who kidnapped Takada...</i>

171
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,112
<i>was not me.</i>

172
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,990
I see... If that's the case, then...

173
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
It's Mello.

174
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>Yes...</i>

175
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,745
I'll be honest.

176
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,831
The individual I placed
to guard Takada...

177
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,667
has confirmed that Mello was
the one who abducted her.

178
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,547
I'm sorry this happened while
we had an escort with her.

179
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,176
Near... Can't you contact Mello?

180
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>No, it's impossible.
I have a method, but...</i>

181
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,849
<i>There is no way that Mello would
respond in this situation.</i>

182
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,231
Let me take off my underwear...

183
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,525
after I wrap the blanket around me.

184
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,196
Fine.

185
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>NHN NEWS 7
LADY TAKADA KIDNAPPED</i>

186
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,395
<i>They are still tracking
Lady Takada's whereabouts</i>

187
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,730
You weren't able to get through
were you, Light?

188
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes.
Miss Takada's cell phone is off.

189
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,489
<i>I want to get in contact with
Takada as soon as possible,</i>

190
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,949
<i>but right now, all I can do is wait.</i>

191
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,441
<i>This is the only thing
I can do...</i>

192
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,859
<i>If I don't do it...</i>

193
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,697
<i>We are still unable to identify
the man who was shot.</i>

194
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,076
<i>Matt... I never thought
you would be killed...</i>

195
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>Forgive me...</i>

196
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,889
- Light!
- Impossible!

197
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,057
Everyone, be quiet.

198
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,643
Yes?

199
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,437
<i>Light... I...</i>

200
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,980
Miss Takada?!

201
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,191
Miss Takada, are you all right?!

202
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,695
<i>The only reason that she'd call me
without notice like this.</i>

203
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>means she escaped
from Mello... or...</i>

204
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,993
<i>Light, help me...!</i>

205
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,330
It's all right. Calm down and
answer my questions.

206
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,832
A- All right.

207
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,628
<i>First, location.
Do you know where you are?</i>

208
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,297
I don't know where I am...

209
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,133
I was put inside a truck.
It was locked from the outside...

210
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,886
We went on the freeway and

211
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,847
I once saw a sign that said
we were heading toward Nagano.

212
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,184
Right now, I'm inside a building...

213
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,354
<i>Miss Takada...
you are Kira's spokesperson.</i>

214
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,815
Do you remember telling me

215
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,193
that there might be people
who're after your life?

216
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,404
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

217
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,158
We talked about what
you would do in that situation.

218
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,743
Do you remember?

219
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,245
<i>I remember...</i>

220
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,290
I did as you said...

221
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,584
I did it...

222
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,835
<i>She did it!</i>

223
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,380
I didn't struggle even when
I was stripped naked...

224
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,008
I did exactly as you said.

225
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,346
I made survival my first priority...
and did it.

226
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,854
Light, I did everything
you told me to do...

227
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,398
Come quickly... Help me...!

228
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,649
Miss Takada...

229
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,986
You know what to do afterwards,
don't you?

230
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,157
<i>Do as many killings as
I can do while I can...</i>

231
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,452
|- | know...

232
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,203
- But Light...
- You can do it, can't you?

233
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,337
I can...

234
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,387
Aizawa, Ide, let's go.

235
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,349
- Okay.
- Matsuda, take care of headquarters.

236
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,808
All right.

237
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,112
<i>It's me...</i>

238
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>Send me as many names as
you can of those to be punished...</i>

239
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,158
<i>My email is...</i>

240
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,577
Yes, yes, I understand.

241
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,081
<i>The fact that
she's called me like this,</i>

242
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,416
<i>means that...
she's killed her kidnappers...</i>

243
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>Then the only thing
that's certain is that</i>

244
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,587
<i>she's in a situation where
she can't make any moves...</i>

245
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,801
Nakajima, I'm going to go to
the scene of the crime for the case.

246
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,219
Okay.

247
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,514
We've discovered the location
by tracing the call.

248
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,849
Head to Karuizawa by freeway.

249
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,351
Karuizawa, huh?

250
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,812
Damn it.
It'll take at least thirty minutes.

251
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,941
Hurry. It's Mello.
We don't know what he'll do.

252
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,317
Yeah...

253
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,949
<i>For God's sake...
Aizawa and Ide are so stupid!</i>

254
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,410
<i>They both got into
the front seat without a thought.</i>

255
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,286
<i>This is just too easy.</i>

256
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,544
<i>What...? Mello...!</i>

257
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,297
What's going on?!
