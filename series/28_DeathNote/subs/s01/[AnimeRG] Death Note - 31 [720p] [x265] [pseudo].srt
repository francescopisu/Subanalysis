<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai

<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>Wanna get them mad? Get them mad?
Get them mad? People</i>

00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,660
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,621
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

9
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,553
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

10
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

11
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:04,523
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

13
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,358
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

14
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,818
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,615
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>Are you worried?</i>

19
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,132
The current Kira is foolish and

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,967
his exchange with the Japanese
task force was far too convenient.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,176
Taking that into consideration...

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,721
Kira is probably conspiring with
the Japanese task force headquarters.

23
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,265
- Conspiring?
- If that's the case, then Kira is...

24
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,892
the new L.

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,395
Members of
the Japanese Task force:

26
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:49,735
Was there ever a time when
the Second L was thought to be Kira?

27
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>Near... I've got to kill him!</i>

28
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,200
Bad news!
Demegawa's on TV and...

29
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,662
I, Demegawa, along with
my comrades have finally pinpointed

30
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,414
the location of and surrounded...

31
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,252
the hideout of the evil organization
that is trying to catch our god, Kira.

32
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,214
TRANSFER

33
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:34,029
<i>Fellow Kira followers!
Do not rush in all at once.</i>

34
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,991
<i>The traitors may hide
among you to escape.</i>

35
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:44,247
I am Kira's voice.
Follow me and we will corner them...

36
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,209
Place them in front of the cameras...

37
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,252
And offer them to Kira!

38
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,304
I'm not going to miss them!

39
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,685
Near, you have to get out of there.

40
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,854
You have some nerve saying that...
being Kira.

41
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,148
You're still saying that?

42
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,735
There are other organizations
that are chasing Kira.

43
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,322
We get attacked as soon
as I begin to suspect you.

44
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,324
The timing is too convenient.

45
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,037
Near, you've made some kind of mistake
and are making too many assumptions.

46
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,915
Members of the task force...

47
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,460
<i>Kira is probably among you.</i>

48
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,629
<i>Think carefully.</i>

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,550
<i>"Light is Kira... "</i>

50
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,261
<i>My suspicions are
getting stronger again...</i>

51
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,390
<i>The former L also
thought that Light was Kira...</i>

52
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,066
The first wave of twenty people will...

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,986
break the door and get inside!
The second wave will stand by!

54
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,073
Idiot, out of the way!
We're the first wave!

55
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,200
What?! We're going first!

56
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,789
Near, we've got to
get away immediately.

57
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,125
They're really such foolish people.

58
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,838
I'm not surprised that there are
people who follow Kira.

59
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:22,888
Since they hope that Kira
will bring justice to evildoers.

60
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,308
The people who are storming
in here are different.

61
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,268
They really are worthless people...

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,897
Selfish people...
who only want to have some fun.

63
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,151
I know that, but right now...

64
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,821
Let's use L's fortune and
the Anti-Kira people we hired.

65
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,533
But if we carry out that plan once...

66
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,495
Let's do it.
We should be all ready prepared.

67
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,914
It should be interesting...

68
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,849
M- M...

69
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,311
It's money!

70
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,279
It's money!

71
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>Money?</i>

72
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,407
Wow! So much!

73
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,201
Amazing...

74
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,662
I wish I were there.

75
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,621
Matsuda...

76
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,207
Jeez. Humans are sure interesting.

77
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,711
Well, that can buy apples.
So I kind of understand.

78
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,964
<i>- I grabbed these 17/192'!
- Cut' if out!</i>

79
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
Out of the way!

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>Damn. Curse you, Near!</i>

81
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>He plans to use
this chaos to escape!</i>

82
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,972
<i>But then he'll be caught on
Demegawa's cameras...</i>

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,187
Pilot! Go to the floor where
the money is coming from!

84
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,274
Oh man. What is Deme doing?!

85
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,818
You can't buy love and peace
with money!

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,407
<i>A large ﬂurry of money is causing
a panic in Lower Manhattan.</i>

87
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,117
<i>It's the police!</i>

88
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,577
<i>The police?!</i>

89
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,371
<i>As you see they were called in
to contain this chaos!</i>

90
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,748
<i>This is bad... at this rate...</i>

91
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,546
Let's go.

92
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,383
Right now, we can just walk out
the entrance.

93
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,345
As expected, the police have to
take action in a riot like this.

94
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,098
<i>Damn it... They were prepared
for something like this...</i>

95
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>They plan to come out
disguised amongst the police!</i>

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>Telling Aizawa and the others
to watch over the police</i>

97
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,147
<i>is like saying that I'm Kira!</i>

98
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,816
<i>The police have come out
from the building.</i>

99
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,362
<i>Where is he?!</i>

100
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>He should be among them...</i>

101
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,532
<i>Where?!</i>

102
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,711
<i>Damn it...</i>

103
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,738
I wonder how much money that was...

104
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,781
Matsuda...

105
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,200
It was probably
about 10 million dollars...

106
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,534
How many apples is that?

107
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,252
Near!

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,837
Near?!

109
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>This is Near.</i>

110
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,222
We've reestablished a connection,

111
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,807
so I decided I should give you a call.

112
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,351
<i>Near, you're safe.</i>

113
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,520
Members of the task force...

114
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,941
I think it's about time that you have
some certainty about who Kira is.

115
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,152
<i>We were attacked at such
a convenient time.</i>

116
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>It's like saying that Kira is in
the Japanese Task Force Headquarters.</i>

117
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,199
<i>With this in mind,</i>

118
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,828
<i>you're worse than a preschooler if
you're not suspicious of the Second L.</i>

119
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,790
The number I gave the day
before is working again,

120
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,709
so call any time you like.

121
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,503
<i>Well, then...
I'll be waiting.</i>

122
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,346
He's pretty sure of himself.
Near's pretty bold.

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,687
Everyone, help Near if you want to.

124
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,315
I'm not satisfied with this situation.

125
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,863
Ideally, we should be
cooperating with the SPK.

126
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
Near is tripping us up, isn't he?

127
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,350
<i>When I think about...</i>

128
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>Deputy Director Yagami,
I don't want to suspect Light.</i>

129
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>But...</i>

130
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,315
Dad?

131
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,110
Welcome back.
So you're home today.

132
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,988
Yeah... You're still awake?

133
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,948
I have exams coming up...

134
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,325
I see.

135
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,285
Don't push yourself too hard.

136
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,329
Okay. You too.

137
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,520
<i>It's not unusual for someone
to want to contact Near.</i>

138
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,563
<i>The problem comes after that.</i>

139
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,651
<i>If I'm late to act,
something I can't ﬁx may happen...</i>

140
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,783
<i>I have no choice but to do it!</i>

141
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,580
It's an emergency order from Light.

142
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,253
Umm... number three...

143
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,132
Huh?

144
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,426
No way...

145
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,932
Yes, this is Near.

146
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>This is Aizawa of
the Japanese Task Force.</i>

147
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,161
The time has finally come...

148
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,874
In order to keep me safe and
for me to become a normal wife...

149
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,334
This is what Light wants for me!

150
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,087
He wants me to be happy
just as a woman should be...

151
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,631
Light... Thank you...

152
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,263
I see. How fascinating.

153
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,933
So, that L was detained for more
than 50 days...

154
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,812
and there were two suspects who were
cleared due to the 13-day rule.

155
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,482
Of course, that alone doesn't mean
that they're Kira...

156
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,569
<i>So L just simply released them?</i>

157
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,072
No... L had Deputy Director Yagami,
who was Bureau Chief at the time...

158
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,824
put on an act.

159
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:44,120
He said that they both had
been found to be Kira and Second Kira...

160
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,497
and were being taken to be executed...

161
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,667
During that, the Deputy Director...

162
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,838
pointed a gun at the suspects and said
that he would kill Kira and kill himself.

163
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,927
<i>We rationalized if they were Kira,</i>

164
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,471
<i>they would kill the Deputy Director
if pressed that far.</i>

165
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,017
<i>Kira is quite impressive...</i>

166
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,396
<i>He used his detainment to
demonstrate his innocence...</i>

167
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,694
<i>Did the suspect volunteer
himself to be detained?</i>

168
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,616
<i>Come to think of it,
Light did volunteer to be detained...</i>

169
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,204
<i>If he did,
then it's already decided...</i>

170
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,541
So who is it?
Who were those two suspects?

171
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,169
I can't tell you that much.

172
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,715
I'm still a member of the Japanese
Task Force and am working under L.

173
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,009
<i>I understand.</i>

174
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,388
Thank you very much for
your valuable information.

175
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,556
Especially the part about
the Shinigami eyes

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,600
that enable people
to see other's names.

177
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,894
<i>It's the ﬁrst I've heard of it.
It will be helpful. Good bye.</i>

178
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,114
Is it all right? Near, shouldn't you
have pressed a little more?

179
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,160
I think that his cooperation with us
is fine at this rate. Also...

180
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,413
I discovered
something very important...

181
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,666
Deputy Director Yagami and the person

182
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,502
who is suspected of being Kira
are parent and child.

183
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,088
That's the only thing it could be.

184
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,301
It's the only reason he would say
that he would kill Kira and kill himself...

185
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,304
Therefore...

186
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,433
The Second L, and the one
who I think is Kira, is...

187
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,686
Light Yagami.

188
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,779
Light.

189
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,281
Yes.

190
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,909
I'm going to tell you the truth.
I contacted Near.

191
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,666
Don't worry about it.

192
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,296
I suggested it...
So what did you say?

193
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,173
Oh...

194
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,762
No, I won't ask. It was strange of me
to ask about that.

195
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,517
I want to believe that
you're not Kira...

196
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,354
Sorry for doing this again,

197
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,315
but I want to observe you until
we catch Kira.

198
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,859
And Misa Amane as well.

199
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,737
I'm going to check your room
right now.

200
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,823
There's a possibility that Amane
has a notebook.

201
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,658
Hold on, Mr. Aizawa!

202
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,828
No, go right ahead.
You can prove to everyone that...

203
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,665
I'm not sneaking around
and contacting Misa.

204
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,932
<i>Mogi...</i>

205
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,309
I also want to make sure.

206
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,025
<i>It would be best if
Light isn't Kira, but...</i>

207
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,196
<i>If Amane has any evidence
linking her to Kira...</i>

208
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,115
<i>If that happens...</i>

209
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,061
Oh! Mochi and Monchichi!

210
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,063
It's been a while.

211
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,567
Light hasn't come back because
of the Kira investigation

212
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,860
so I've been so bored.

213
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,114
<i>It's impossible for her to have the notebook
on her while dressed like that...</i>

214
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,035
We were just told that there
were explosives planted at L's house.

215
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,246
We think it's a prank,
but we'd still like to check the room...

216
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,666
What?! Is Light all right?
I've got to call him.

217
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,042
You can't.

218
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,461
Why?

219
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,045
Light is all right.

220
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,716
He's busy with something right now,

221
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,676
so he handed the investigation to us.

222
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,678
I guess so.

223
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,725
Light loves me very much, so he'd
probably just worry if he heard my voice.

224
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,936
<i>Search as much
as you like, Aizawa...</i>

225
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,564
<i>You won't ﬁnd the notebook...</i>

226
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't want all this to ruin
the mood we have here.

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,333
We're not in a club.
You and Mogi should do as you see fit.

228
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,380
Oh. It's time for Kira's Kingdom.

229
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,385
KIRA'S KINGDOM

230
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,184
<i>Hello, supporters of Kira.
I am Demegawa, the voice of Kira.</i>

231
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:04,106
<i>Take a look. Kira's Kingdom
shares its name with this program.</i>

232
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,110
Its construction is going smoothly
thanks to your support.

233
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,323
<i>Let's welcome Kira here!</i>

234
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,494
Whoa... such bad taste...

235
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,585
Hey, is everything all right?

236
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,213
Yeah, it must have been a prank.

237
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,298
But just in case,

238
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,676
one of us is going to stay back to keep
watch over you for the next few days.

239
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,469
Okay. Thank you.

240
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,390
Mogi, you can go back
to headquarters. I'll stay.

241
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,518
Huh? Why Monchichi instead of Mochi?

242
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,937
Don't you trust me?

243
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,774
That's not it. You're just not Monchichi
since you cut your hair.

244
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,942
It's not cute anymore.

245
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,529
- Mogi!
- Yes. Sorry!

246
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,155
You stay here.

247
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,451
<i>We need everyone to
donate a million yen</i>

248
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,997
<i>in order to complete
construction of Kira's Kingdom!</i>

249
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,791
Sounds phony...

250
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,711
Yeah. It's no different from
any other suspicious group.

251
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,255
It doesn't seem like Kira...

252
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>Demegawa...
he's doing things on his own...</i>

253
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,345
<i>People will begin to drift away
from Kira if he does this.</i>

254
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,475
<i>I no longer need Demegawa... but...</i>

255
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,357
Oh, welcome back...

256
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,237
We didn't find a notebook in
Light and Misa's apartment.

257
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,032
- But...
- I understand.

258
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,744
Keep watch over me until
you're satisfied.

259
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
<i>Now...</i>

260
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,584
<i>Let me introduce Kira's Kingdom's
executive members I've handpicked!</i>

261
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,465

262
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,633
Delete.

263
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,267
<i>Together with Kira, we will...</i>

264
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,895
Delete.

265
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,650
Delete!

266
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,110
Delete!

267
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,499
Please save me!

268
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,092

What is this?

271
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,483
Why would Kira kill his supporters?

272
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,111
Do you suppose that he wanted to
stop them from going overboard?

273
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,488
That might be so.

274
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,699
But, this is horrible.

275
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,409

276
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,705
<i>There was no chance for Misa Amane
or Light to use the notebook...</i>

277
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,545
<i>Mikami... I can deﬁnitely use him!
Looks like I made the right choice...</i>

278
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:20,344
<i>He understands Kira's thoughts... ideals
... what he does and doesn't want.</i>

279
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,721
<i>He takes action without orders.</i>

280
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,683
<i>I made Misa relinquish ownership
of the Death Note...</i>

281
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,978
<i>Misa has lost all memory
of the Death Note</i>

282
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,689
<i>and I've sent the Death Note
to someone else.</i>

283
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,859
<i>Right now she cannot answer
any questions about it.</i>

284
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,694
<i>She's just an ordinary woman.</i>

285
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,405
<i>The question is...</i>

286
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,031
<i>the next owner.</i>

287
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,119
<i>He called upon Kira
through the television..</i>

288
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,329
<i>He worships Kira from
