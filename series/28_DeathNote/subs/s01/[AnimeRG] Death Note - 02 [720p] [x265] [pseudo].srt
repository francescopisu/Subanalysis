00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,631
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,342
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:13,514
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:48,465
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,927
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,244
<i>World.</i>

16
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,507
The human whose name is written
in this note shall die.

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,802
Please...

18
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,470
<i>- Stop!
- Now let's see...</i>

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>The Death Note is real!</i>

20
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,693
Don't think for a moment,

21
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,196
that any human who's used
the Death Note can go to Heaven or Hell.

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,867
I want the world to know...
of my existence!

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,078
And that there's someone who is
passing judgment onto them!

24
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,247
And I will become...

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,083
the god of this new world!

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,420
CONFRONTATION

27
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,135
I had no idea what he was thinking,
so I'm done with him.

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,305
Really? Then how was it
with that other older guy?

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,848
Mr. Yagami.

30
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,434
Please translate the sentence
into Japanese.

31
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,685
Yes.

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,524
"When finally, he fully succeeded
in making his dream a reality,

33
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:34,404
he was immersed in beatitude. "

34
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,615
Very good.

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,577
As usual, a perfect answer.

36
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,750
Well then, class is dismissed.

37
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,591
<i>â€ It's finally over.
â€ Where do you want to go after?</i>

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,094
<i>â€ School sure is boring.
â€ Hmm, where should we go?</i>

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
Hey, Light!

40
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,431
Light, are you listening to me?

41
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,891
Don't talk to me.

42
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,603
Others can hear my voice
when I talk, unlike yours.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,689
You're so boring.

44
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,316
Hey, Light! We're going to go...

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,984
Sorry, I have something to do.

46
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,196
You don't have anything to do.

47
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,199
Aren't you just going home
like you usually do?

48
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,910
What are you talking about?
I have something to do.

49
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,664
Something very important.

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,960
<i>Yamada is suspected of stabbing
a fellow employee in the abdomen</i>

51
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,671
<i>at a restaurant in Kabukicho,
Shinjuku, yesterday.</i>

52
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>The knife was from the restaurant
and was roughly twelve inches long.</i>

53
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,969
<i>- Hey!
- The suspect said...</i>

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>- Hey, Light!
- "he was being rude, so I just lost it. "</i>

55
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,556
What is it?

56
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,475
You're really working very hard.

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,728
I can't waste any time.

58
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,356
I only have a limited amount of time
to write names in the notebook...

59
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,110
The only time I have is when I get
home from school and until I go to bed.

60
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,238
I also need to maintain my grades.

61
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,282
I can't sleep during class.

62
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,827
I need to do all of my homework
for school and my prep classes.

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,163
Lack of sleep is dangerous.

64
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,457
It will affect my health
and concentration.

65
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,836
After all, I'm trying to change
this world into a utopia without evil.

66
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,921
There's never enough time.

67
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,844
Why did you lock the door, Light?

68
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,387
It's Sayu.

69
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,638
What is it?

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,265
Help me with my homework.

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,768
Okay, sure.

72
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,190
It's on quadratic equations!

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,026
I'm sorry if you were studying.

74
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,362
But it just doesn't make
any sense.

75
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,739
Please help me.

76
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,823
All right.

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,867
Light, be careful.

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,788
Any human who touches
the notebook in your drawer...

79
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,706
will be able to see me.

80
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,045
<i>He waits to tell me that
crucial detail now? Damn Shinigami!</i>

81
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,214
What's wrong, Light?

82
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,715
It's nothing.

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,968
Well, what exactly
don't you understand?

84
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,137
Well, umm...

85
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,388
I think everything.

86
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,350
From what we know,

87
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,935
there have been 52 deaths
just this past week.

88
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,354
All from heart attacks.

89
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:17,526
They're all criminals who were wanted
or being held in prison.

90
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,613
There are probably other criminals
whose deaths are still unaccounted for.

91
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,407
Does that mean the death toll
could easily be over a hundred?

92
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,789
Chief... we've already started!

93
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,000
I know.
I had a call from headquarters.

94
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,669
At any rate...

95
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,547
they were all criminals who
probably would have been executed.

96
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,340
Perhaps we shouldn't
concern ourselves...

97
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,424
Are you stupid?!

98
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,927
It doesn't matter if
they're criminals or on death row.

99
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,262
Killing them is still murder.

100
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,014
We aren't even sure that
they were murdered.

101
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,393
How can over 100 people
have heart attacks at the same time?!

102
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,103
It has got to be murder.

103
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:58,024
Is it even possible to kill
that many people at the same time?

104
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,320
We believe that a large organization
carefully orchestrated these killings.

105
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,781
If you say a large organization
is involved,

106
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,118
I can't help but think that
the FBI or CIA is involved.

107
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,953
I dare you to say that again!

108
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,831
Now, now.
Let's stop joking around.

109
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,834
We have to first clarify if these
are murders,

110
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,210
or strange coincidences.

111
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,379
But don't all the autopsy reports
say that

112
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,132
the deaths were caused
by inexplicable heart attacks?

113
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,636
I don't see what else can be learned
from just the way they died.

114
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,971
That's right!

115
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,891
It would be worth looking into
if they were stabbed with knives!

116
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,145
If that's the case,
we'll just have to have L solve this!

117
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,191
What do you think?

118
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,905
Chief, what is "L"?

119
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,782
This is your first time at
this conference, isn't it?

120
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,871
No one knows L's name, location
or what he looks like.

121
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,832
But he's managed to solve
every case he's taken,

122
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,584
no matter how difficult it is.

123
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,670
He's cracked many of
the world's unsolved cases.

124
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,631
He's our trump card,
our secret weapon.

125
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,382
Our last hope.

126
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,717
Something like that.

127
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:12,474
But isn't L so arrogant that he
only takes cases that interest him?

128
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,683
That's right.

129
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,561
We can't even contact him.

130
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,855
L is already involved.

131
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,579
L is already investigating this case.

132
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,539
Huh? Watari?

133
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,041
Watari?

134
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,044
He's the only man who can contact L.

135
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,339
Furthermore, Watari's identity
is also unknown...

136
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,216
Please be silent.

137
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,885
L will now speak.

138
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,141
<i>Members of the ICPO...</i>

139
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,228
<i>lam L.</i>

140
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:04,985
What are we doing sneaking around
such a desolate place, Light?

141
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,406
People who touch the Death Note
can see you, can't they?

142
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,243
I can't walk around with
something this dangerous.

143
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,746
Up until now, I thought that if
my family saw the notebook...

144
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,125
<i>I could pass it off as
a record of cases</i>

145
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,044
which I'm using to study
to become a detective.

146
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,089
But I'm walking a fine line
right now.

147
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,841
If I'm not careful,

148
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,467
I might end up killing...

149
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,761
my own family.

150
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,730
<i>This case is unprecedented
in scope and difficulty.</i>

151
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>It involves more people than
any other case preceding it.</i>

152
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,862
<i>It is also an unforgivable case
of serial murder.</i>

153
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,325
<i>In order to solve this case,
I need the ICPO...</i>

154
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,454
<i>no, various worldwide organizations,
to cooperate fully.</i>

155
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>I want you to decide whether
you'll support me at this conference.</i>

156
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:07,005
<i>Also... I strongly desire to work
with the Japanese Police.</i>

157
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,883
W- Why Japan?

158
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>Regardless of how many
suspects there are,</i>

159
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,056
<i>there's a strong possibility
that they are Japanese.</i>

160
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,809
<i>Even if they aren't Japanese,
they are hiding in Japan.</i>

161
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,644
What grounds do you
have for your claims?

162
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,147
<i>Why Japan?</i>

163
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,651
<i>I think I can show you very soon
by directly confronting the perpetrator.</i>

164
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,362
A direct confrontation?

165
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,450
<i>At any rate, I would like set up
headquarters in Japan.</i>

166
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,957
That was pretty easy to make...

167
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,169
Hmm? Does that mean you
were able to hide the notebook?

168
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,130
Yeah, in this drawer.

169
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,342
Does that count as a hiding place?

170
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,011
You left the key in the lock.

171
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,304
That's fine.

172
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,391
It's better that I intentionally
left the key in a noticeable place.

173
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,063
That's just a regular diary!

174
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,859
Most people will probably be satisfied
with the secrets of this drawer...

175
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,237
after reading this diary.

176
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,696
But...

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,032
The real key... is this.

178
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,370
There's nothing suspicious
about having one of these on my desk.

179
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,788
It's just a regular ballpoint pen.

180
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,206
I'll use the ink cartridge.

181
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,041
That's the key?

182
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,669
Yeah. On the back of the drawer...

183
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,296
there's a small hole that's hard
to notice if you don't look closely.

184
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,632
You put this in the hole.

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,722
I see.
It's got a false bottom.

186
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,935
Well, you also have the fake diary,
so I doubt anyone will find it.

187
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,436
That's not all.

188
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,357
Even if they discovered
it has a false bottom,

189
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,235
there would be no way that
they could take the notebook.

190
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,238
You see...

191
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,325
This ink cartridge is an insulator
so it doesn't channel electricity,

192
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,119
and stops the flow of electricity
in the circuit.

193
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,204
When the bottom of
this drawer is closed,

194
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,541
this piece of rubber also
stops the flow of electricity.

195
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,420
However, if someone were to
force open the bottom,

196
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,591
gasoline in thin plastic bags
will ignite at that moment and...

197
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,344
the notebook will instantly
be set aflame.

198
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
All evidence will be
completely destroyed.

199
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,056
That's how it's set up.

200
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,059
I can just say the reason
I set it up to burn was that,

201
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,897
"| didn't want anyone to
see my real diary. "

202
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,232
It's a believable excuse.

203
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,942
It is a notebook, after all.

204
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,404
I've heard when a human
gets a Death Note,

205
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,283
the biggest problem they have is
finding a good place to hide it.

206
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,787
But Light, you're probably
the first to go this far.

207
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,916
But that setup is really dangerous.

208
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,376
If you make
the slightest mistake,

209
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,295
you could be badly burned.

210
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,798
Dangerous?
You're talking nonsense again, Ryuk.

211
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,552
I've been putting myself
in danger from the very beginning.

212
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,096
Ever since I first got a hold
of the Death Note.

213
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,184
Compared to that,
this is hardly dangerous.

214
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,312
In fact, quite the opposite.
It protects me.

215
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,814
Which is better?

216
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,943
A small fire in the house,
or being executed?

217
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>Last night, within
the Tokyo West Penitentiary,</i>

218
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,796
<i>Naoki Kurotsukayama, aged thirty-two,
who was being detained for armed robbery...</i>

219
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,006
<i>is reported to have
died of a heart attack.</i>

220
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:41,302
<i>In response to the endless,
bizarre deaths of prisoners...</i>

221
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,972
That's amazing...
Bad guys just keep dying.

222
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,683
It's a little scary,
but it does feel great.

223
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,601
But we really can't
do anything bad now.

224
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,853
I wonder if the police are behind it.

225
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,147
The police don't have
that kind of power.

226
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,357
Don't you know about him?

227
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,650
Huh? About who?

228
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,069
It's Kira... Kira!

229
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,780
I wonder who's going
to be killed next...

230
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,533
KIRA, KILL EVERYONE

231
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,159
SEND MESSAGE?
SEND

232
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,329
ROCOCO KIRA, KILL
MISERY

233
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,916
Someone's already created a website.

234
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,878
"The legend of Kira the savior. "

235
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,965
That's pretty cool.
Is this about you?

236
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,052
Yeah. "Kira" seems to come from
the English word "killer. "

237
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,804
I don't like it too much, but...

238
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,266
I've become "Kira" to the world.

239
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,854
Just searching the word "Kira," and
countless sites like this one appear.

240
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,481
Television and newspapers have
only publicized

241
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,444
"the successive, mysterious deaths
of vicious criminals. "

242
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,656
But the people of the world
can already feel it.

243
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,367
The existence of someone
passing judgment.

244
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,077
Oh?

245
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,205
Ryuk, humans are like that.

246
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,376
For example, there's no way that

247
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,172
anyone would bring up the topic of
killing bad people in homeroom at school.

248
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,134
But if someone were to bring it up,
everyone would act pious.

249
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,969
<i>"That's wrong!"</i>

250
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,138
That's what they're bound to say.

251
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,183
Of course, it's the right thing to say.

252
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:15,271
Humans must put up a front
like that in public.

253
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,398
But their true feelings are there.

254
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,195
They may be afraid or won't acknowledge
my existence on the surface,

255
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,823
but on the internet,
where everyone can be anonymous...

256
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,617
Kira is already thriving.

257
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,163
They don't talk about it,
but they all understand.

258
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,041
Someone is making
the bad guys disappear.

259
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,838
Those who have a clean conscience
are cheering for Kira in their hearts...

260
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,465
And those who have done wrong

261
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,051
fear that heaven's judgment
will strike down upon them.

262
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,762
It's perfect.

263
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,848
Everything is going exactly as planned.

264
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,934
The Scheduled Program will be
interrupted for a Special Broadcast.

265
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,229
<i>We interrupt this program to
bring you</i>

266
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,525
<i>a special, worldwide broadcast from
the ICPO, Interpol.</i>

267
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,026
Hmm? What's this?

268
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,736
Interpol?

269
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,446
<i>We'll begin now.</i>

270
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,492
<i>lam Lind L. Tailor</i>

271
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,662
<i>the only person able to
mobilize the entire world's police.</i>

272
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>Also known as L.</i>

273
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,459
W- Who is this?

274
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,670
It's finally started.

275
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,215
He's never shown his face, right?

276
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,967
So why now?

277
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,344
It means L is serious.

278
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,346
<i>All right, L...</i>

279
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,682
<i>We're doing exactly
what you told us to do.</i>

280
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>Now, let's see you prove what
you said at the ICPO conference.</i>

281
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,565
<i>There has been a string of serial killings
targeting criminals.</i>

282
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:45,027
<i>This is the most atrocious act of murder
in history and it will not go unpunished.</i>

283
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,281
<i>I will definitely catch
the one behind the murders,</i>

284
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,908
<i>commonly known as "Kira. "</i>

285
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,578
He said he'll definitely catch you.

286
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,248
The fool.
There's no way he can catch me.

287
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,375
This is the Death Note!

288
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,504
If you don't have this,
there's no evidence.

289
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,424
There's no way you can catch me.

290
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,219
I knew that the police would
start investigating

291
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,305
and that someone like him
would turn up.

292
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,561
<i>Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind
your motive and why you're doing this.</i>

293
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,731
<i>But what you're doing is...</i>

294
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,024
<i>Evil!</i>

295
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,944
I'm evil?

296
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,448
I am justice!

297
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,909
I'm saving the meek, who fear evil.

298
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,827
I'm the man who will become...

299
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,120
the god of the ideal, new world!

300
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,041
All those who oppose that god...
are evil!

301
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,128
L, you're stupid.

302
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,549
This could've been more interesting
if you'd been a bit smarter...

303
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,067
The entire world is watching

304
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,029
to see what happens if
anyone defies me... L.

305
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
Just five more seconds...

306
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,663
Four... Three...

307
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,915
Two... One...

308
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,263
What's wrong?
Why don't you say something?

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,061
<i>This is u-unbelievable.</i>

310
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,522
<i>I had to check to be sure.</i>

311
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,232
<i>Who would have thought
you could have done this?</i>

312
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,529
<i>Kira, it seems you can kill people
without direct contact.</i>

313
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,533
<i>I couldn't believe it before
seeing it with my own eyes.</i>

314
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,952
<i>Listen to me, Kira.</i>

315
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,374
<i>If you just killed
the man on-screen, Lind L. Tailor,</i>

316
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>you just killed a man who was
scheduled to be executed today.</i>

317
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,046
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

318
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,548
What?!

319
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,883
<i>This criminal is someone who
the police caught secretly.</i>

320
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,012
<i>His capture wasn't broadcast
on television or the internet.</i>

321
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,850
<i>It seems that even you
couldn't get information on him.</i>

322
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,145
He got you.

323
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,607
<i>But I, L... do exist!</i>

324
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>So come on!
Try and kill me!</i>

325
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,988
Why that...!

326
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,241
- What's wrong? Do it quickly!
- What's going on?! This is unreal!

327
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,410
<i>- C'mon! Kill me!
- Are you trying to die, L?!</i>

328
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,871
- What's going on?
- It's Kira versus L!

329
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,456
It's a live murder!

330
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,957
<i>- Come on, Mia!
- This is scary!</i>

331
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,417
<i>Try and kill me!</i>

332
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,337
<i>What's the matter? You can't do it?!</i>

333
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,011
<i>It seems that you can't kill me.</i>

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,599
So, there are some people
that you can't kill.

335
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,435
You've given me a good clue.

336
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,148
<i>I'll tell you something good in return.</i>

337
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,194
<i>I told you that this is
a live broadcast worldwide, but...</i>

338
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,447
<i>This is only being broadcast
in the Kanto region of Japan.</i>

339
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,201
<i>I was planning on broadcasting this
in different areas at different times,</i>

340
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,827
<i>but it seems that I no longer need to.</i>

341
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,373
<i>I now know that you are based
in the Kanto region.</i>

342
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,334
This L guy is pretty good.

343
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,879
<i>The first victim was the perpetrator
of the random murders in Shinjuku.</i>

344
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,217
<i>The police overlooked this case
because it was so minor.</i>

345
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,553
<i>Of all the criminals who
died of heart attacks,</i>

346
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,139
<i>this one's crime
was the least serious.</i>

347
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,143
<i>only broadcast in Japan.</i>

348
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,605
I have been able
to deduce this much.

349
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,274
<i>You are in Japan</i>

350
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:57,321
<i>and your first victim
was your guinea pig.</i>

351
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,868
<i>You're just lucky that you're in Kanto,</i>

352
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,204
<i>the most heavily populated region
in Japan.</i>

353
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,292
<i>I never thought that things
would go quite so well, but...</i>

354
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>Kira, it probably won't be too long
before I can sentence you to death.</i>

355
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,759
L certainly lives up
to his reputation...

356
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,053
Yes, he's proved that
Kira exists,

357
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,849
that the killings took place,
and that Kira's in Japan.

358
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:31,355
<i>Kira, I'm interested how
you commit the murders.</i>

359
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,232
<i>But...</i>

360
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,443
I'll find that out
when I catch you.

361
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,530
Until we meet again...
Kira...

362
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,875
He's going to...

363
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,295
sentence me to death?

364
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,216
Interesting.
I'll accept your challenge.

365
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,053
<i>They both have to hunt
each other down...</i>

366
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,055
<i>but neither of them know each other's
name or what they look like.</i>

367
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,058
<i>And the first one
who's discovered, dies!</i>

368
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,562
<i>Humans sure are interesting!</i>

369
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,647
L...

370
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,732
Kira...!

371
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,402
- I will definitely find and finish you!
- I will definitely find and finish you!

372
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,571
- I am...
- lam...

373
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,239
- justice!
- Justice!

374
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,493
TO BE CONTINUED

375
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:30,956
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

376
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,420
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

377
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,840
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

378
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:45,429
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

379
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:51,769
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

380
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,398
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

381
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

382
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,866
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

383
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,745
<i>To accomplish</i>

384
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:20,506
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

385
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

386
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

387
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,105
PREVIEW

388
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,358
I'm not the one who's going to find L.

389
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,277
The police will track him down...

390
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,700
Looks like I may be able to provide
you with a little more entertainment, Ryuk.
