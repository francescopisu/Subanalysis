<i>You've dealt with it quickly, Mikami...</i>

145
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,507
<i>No. She's not a bad choice.</i>

146
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>I wouldn't have thought of her

147
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,845
<i>Things may be getting easier...</i>

148
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,892
<i>I want to contact him

149
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,145
<i>Kiyomi Takada...</i>

150
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,065
<i>I spoke to her when we
were on a debate show.</i>

151
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,569
<i>She was a sharp and
discerning host but...</i>

152
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,697
<i>Her attitude changed
when Kira was brought up.</i>

153
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>She has a uniquely strict way of thinking.
She hates crimes and social evils.</i>

154
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,541
<i>I talked to her privately
several times afterwards.</i>

155
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,126
<i>She clearly...</i>

156
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,003
<i>thinks like Kira...</i>

157
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>She's a journalist who is
most worthy of being Kira's voice...</i>

158
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,224
<i>Kiyomi Takada...</i>

159
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,312
<i>It would be too suspicious to choose
an ex-girlfriend as a spokesperson.</i>

160
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,065
<i>There was no sign of Light
sending any messages.</i>

161
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,735
<i>Am I reading too much into this?</i>

162
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,239
Everyone.
About our investigation...

163
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,992
I think we should incorporate
Kiyomi Takada from now on.

164
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,369
To be honest,

165
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,539
I was quite friendly with
her during my college days.

166
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,832
Oh?!

167
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,167
<i>He brought it up himself?!</i>

168
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,294
<i>That means he has
no intention of hiding that fact...</i>

169
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,924
If Kira is giving her orders
to read messages...

170
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:01,429
It might be our best option to
find a way to get Kira through her.

171
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,725
KIYOMI TAKADA CHOSEN AS
KIRA'S SPOKESPERSON

172
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:15,235
That's all right. I know her
cell phone number...

173
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,655
She'll meet me if I ask her to.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,909
That's some confidence.
So typical of you, Light.

175
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,664
But it'll probably be difficult
to get her to help catch Kira.

176
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,000
I talked to her about many things
during college.

177
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,921
She's quite...
the Kira-worshiper.

178
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,634
But we can use that.

179
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,763
Right now, even the police
say that they support Kira.

180
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,099
But actually they're doing nothing.

181
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,602
So I'll reveal that
I've joined the police

182
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:54,482
and ask her what I can do to
give instructions to Kira.

183
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,402
It wouldn't sound like a bad idea
to a Kira-supporter like herself.

184
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,779
Will it go well?!

185
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,323
I don't know. But it's worth trying.

186
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,160
I agree, we shouldn't ignore
a lead that's right before our eyes.

187
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,830
Then let's do this tonight, if possible.

188
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,123
Light!

189
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,127
I want to listen in on
your conversation with Takada.

190
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,878
Sure. I don't mind.

191
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,797
Actually, I want you to listen.

192
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,302
We don't know when she may
give us a hint about Kira.

193
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,803
Y- Yeah...

194
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,313
Hello?!

195
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,273
<i>Miss Takada, it's Yagami.</i>

196
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,025
<i>Yagami?!</i>

197
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,694
<i>It's been a while. What is it?!</i>

198
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,903
Miss Takada...

199
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,739
I'd like to discuss
something important with you.

200
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,782
Could you meet me?!

201
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,576
I want to ask a favor of you...

202
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,536
<i>A favor?!</i>

203
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,123
Yeah... It might be impossible,

204
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,918
since you're the woman
the whole world's watching, but...

205
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:02,175
I don't think you would have
called if that wasn't the case.

206
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
<i>You're right...</i>

207
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,471
Since we graduated college,

208
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,432
I've wanted to tell you,
but I've never had the chance...

209
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:15,897
But since we've had the chance
to connect through our jobs as adults...

210
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,483
I can't help but feel
that this is fate.

211
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,611
Where do you work now?

212
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,863
<i>I'm with the police right now...</i>

213
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>There's also something
I really wanted to tell you in person...</i>

214
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>Right now, the police won't
do anything to betray Kira...</i>

215
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, I may not be able to cooperate,
depending on what you say.

216
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,922
Thank you. I just want you to meet me
and listen to what I have to say.

217
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,800
Somewhere... just the two of us...

218
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,972
Okay... after tonight's
broadcast is finished...

219
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,851
All right. I'll find a hotel room.

220
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,562
<i>But is that all right?</i>

221
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,691
Yagami, I thought you were
living with Miss Amane.

222
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,653
Are you still happy together?

223
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,863
<i>Well...</i>

224
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,284
The truth is she doesn't have
the intelligence to be my partner...

225
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,328
Mochi.

226
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,413
Yes?

227
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,206
Your cooking is wonderful,

228
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,417
and I appreciate that you've been
doing everything for me,

229
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,626
but it's been five days.

230
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,794
Yes.

231
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,505
Light doesn't know about this,
does he?!

232
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,383
I'm beginning to get
a bad feeling about this.

233
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,467
Yes...

234
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,678
No matter how much Light trusts me...

235
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,055
<i>It would't be unusual if he thinks
I'm having an affair...</i>

236
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,391
<i>He'll deﬁnitely be jealous!</i>

237
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,812
<i>Near and the others told me that
this woman is the Second Kira.</i>

238
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>Bu! she is so stupid. - -
Can she really be- - -.7</i>

239
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,030
Kira hasn't tried to contact me yet...

240
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,995
<i>If... Kira is in a situation where he
couldn't contact me even if he wanted to...</i>

241
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,664
<i>He'll try to contact Takada ﬁrst...</i>

242
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,544
<i>Good evening.
This is the nine o'clock news.</i>

243
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,632
<i>Kira's words, which I will convey to you,
will become the law of this world.</i>

244
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,762
<i>Apart from those whose
existence itself is considered evil.</i>

245
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,892
<i>People who have an ability,
who do not use</i>

246
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,311
<i>their abilities, for the good of society
will also not be tolerated.</i>

247
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,564
What? Does that mean that
he's going to kill lazy people?!

248
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,274
You're kidding, right?!

249
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,153
<i>You're overdoing it, Mikami.
No, it's too early.</i>

250
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>I've got to contact Mikami...</i>

251
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,575
Matsuda, how is it going?!

252
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,746
Yes, the sound and visuals
are great. No blind spots!

253
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>- The nine o'clock news just ended.
- See you again.</i>

254
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,667
Light, I'll be heading back.

255
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,752
Okay.

256
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,663
I've wanted to see you...

257
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,211
<i>I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.</i>

258
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,671
<i>Please have a seat.</i>

259
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:34,011
It doesn't seem like it's been
that long now that you're here...

260
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,028
What's wrong with Light?!
He's silent.

261
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,447
He'll look suspicious if he doesn't
say something quickly.

262
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,909
Ide... Have you ever been in love?!

263
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,327
_ Ho" What?!

264
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,954
The mood's good.

265
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,581
That's not what I meant.

266
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,752
Sorry.

267
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
Kira...

268
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>Is it Mikami?!</i>

269
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,760
She said Kira right now!

270
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,637
Is Kira contacting her directly?!

271
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,015
You should answer it.

272
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,474
Y- Yes...

273
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,437
Hello? No, I'm with a friend...

274
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,063
There's no one else...

275
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,941
<i>If luck is on my side
I'll get on the phone...</i>

276
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,153
<i>Mikami... can you bring me luck?</i>

277
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,739
<i>We decided to meet unexpectedly...</i>

278
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,534
<i>Someone who could privately
call on Kira's spokesperson...</i>

279
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,245
Pass the phone over to your friend.

280
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,750
He wants me to give
the phone to you...

281
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,086
<i>Choosing you was
the best decision I made.</i>

282
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,049
She's passed the phone to Light...

283
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,176
It's dangerous if it's really Kira!

284
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,178
Hello?

285
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,388
<i>Who are you?!</i>

286
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,935
November 26?! Five pages?!
What are you talking about?!

287
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,147
God!

288
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,193
<i>All right... Mikami...
How much have you ﬁgured out?</i>

289
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,862
<i>You can't move freely now...</i>

290
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,322
Yes.

291
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,865
<i>You're being watched right now.</i>

292
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,033
Yes.

293
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,160
Are you really Kira?!

294
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,038
<i>Is he asking me to kill right now?!</i>

295
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,373
Turn to Sakura TV.

296
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,875
What? Sakura TV?!

297
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,543
Sakura TV.

298
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>We're going to call back Kira
with whatever it takes!</i>

299
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,009
He died!

300
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,552
This is bad! He's the real thing!

301
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,847
<i>- Mikami... you're better than I expected.
- Yes...</i>

302
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,477
KIRA WANTS TO HAVE THE ROOM CHECKED FOR DEVICES.
I'M REMOVING EVERYTHING BEFORE HE SEES THEM.

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,562
It can't be helped...

304
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,984
What... is the meaning of this?!

305
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,696
Now I can talk to you
without any constraints.

306
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,284
Listen, Kiyomi... I'm Kira.

307
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,832
That's right. I'm Kira.
That's all...

308
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>Yagami is... Kira.</i>

309
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,465
Listen. I won't allow you
to ask Kiyomi...

310
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>who I am.</i>

311
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,429
Yes. I leave the rest to you, God...

312
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,848
Understand?

313
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,101
I am Kira and that man right now is

314
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,603
someone with whom I've shared
Kira's power.

315
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,232
Y- You really are amazing...

316
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:39,530
You're the only man I've respected
and admired my entire life.

317
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,116
For you to be Kira...

318
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,118
That's too amazing!

319
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,664
With me... you're...

320
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,125
going to become the goddess
of the new world...

321
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,420
Yagami...

322
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,305
Light, are you all right?!

323
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,850
Yes. Things went well with Takada.

324
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:13,397
I'm going to pretend to go outwith her
so I can find out more about Kira.
