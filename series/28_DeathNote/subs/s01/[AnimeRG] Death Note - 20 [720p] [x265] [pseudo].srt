<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,439
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity

16
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,275
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,526
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

21
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,371
<i>Are you worried?</i>

00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,505
MAKESHIFT

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,133
<i>Let's begin our meeting.</i>

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,387
Only seven out of the eight are present.
That means that...

25
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,973
They probably killed one of them.

26
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,978
<i>For the further advancement
of the Yotsuba Group...</i>

27
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>who shall we kill?</i>

28
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,692
See? It's like I said.

29
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>This is bad.
If things continue like this...</i>

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,240
<i>Before that, we have several topics
which we should discuss.</i>

31
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,535
First, concerning Hatori's death...

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,120
That couldn't be helped.

33
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,333
To be honest,
I'm relieved that he's dead.

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,253
Kira has clearly shown
what'll happen

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,631
to whoever tries
to leave these meetings.

36
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,386
I think we all know what
Hatori's death means.

37
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,347
Take it to heart.

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,184
<i>Next, Era/do Coil's report...</i>

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,521
One of their colleagues just died.
Is that it?!

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,777
Five million dollars.
Just for this report, huh?

41
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,239
He hasn't found anything
important about L,

42
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,117
like his face and name.

43
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,871
Is this Coil really of any use?

44
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,289
Well, wait.

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,708
At the end of this report...

46
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,880
Coil warns us that we shouldn't
take L's existence lightly.

47
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,008
It says, "if you continue with
your current pace of killing..

48
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,970
"for Yotsuba's benefit...
every week on Fridays and Saturdays..

49
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,683
<i>"L could possibly
connect you with Kira. "</i>

50
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:11,400
It's impressive that Coil has
figured out what we've been doing.

51
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,736
At any rate, we should stop killing...

52
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,946
<i>every weekend.</i>

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,283
This is amazing.
It's like they're confessing.

54
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,495
Yeah... As long as
we have this video,

55
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,372
we could probably arrest
all seven of them.

56
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,083
<i>This is deﬁnitely bad...</i>

57
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,711
Kira isn't very flexible either.

58
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,256
It would be nice if he killed
at various times during the week.

59
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,426
The fact that Coil noticed this,

60
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,220
makes it dangerous to
continue killing at our current pace.

61
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,681
From now on,
we should be even more careful

62
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,767
<i>and make sure no one ever ﬁnds out.</i>

63
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,813
Now, on to the main topic.

64
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,107
<i>Who shall we kill?</i>

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,071
We must stop E.L.F. Insurance

66
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,115
from expanding their business
into the Japanese market.

67
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,535
That will hurt not only Yotsuba,
but many other companies' customer base.

68
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,370
Agreed.

69
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:10,000
So, do we agree for these people
from E.L.F. to die by accidental deaths?

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,334
No objections.

71
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,295
What is this?

72
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,088
How can they do this so easily?

73
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,968
<i>Another person is Santaro Zenzai,
a member of the Kugisawa Group.</i>

74
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,804
<i>He's protesting Yotsuba's plans
for the resort development.</i>

75
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,016
<i>Zenzai suffers from
high blood pressure.</i>

76
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,686
<i>So... it is possible to have him to
die of a stroke at a designated time.</i>

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,313
<i>Is this all right?</i>

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>No objections.</i>

79
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,650
Kira.. accidental death...
death by illness...

80
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,611
designated time of deaths.

81
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,698
It's as we thought.
There's no mistake.

82
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:48,079
No. Unfortunately, we can only say that
after those people they named die.

83
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:55,462
As long as we continue to monitor
what these seven say at their meetings,

84
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,759
their actions, and whether
the people they name die...

85
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,386
we'll definitely catch Kira.

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,222
Ryuzaki!

87
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,600
What is it?
Both of you in unison...

88
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,269
I can't go along with your idea!

89
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,563
- It's wrong!
- Yes!

90
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,940
<i>Here it comes...</i>

91
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,526
You seem to plan on catching Kira

92
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,530
by allowing these seven to continue
to murder, but I can't let them!

93
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,408
That's right. It's apparent that
these seven are committing murder!

94
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,080
Can't we prove it's them by
Matsuda's testimony and this footage?

95
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,916
This is problematic.

96
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,585
If we caught them now,

97
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,337
everything we've done until
now will go to waste.

98
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,383
<i>So the E.L.F. will be
three weeks later.</i>

99
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,553
<i>We'll ask Kira to have Zenzai
killed this weekend.</i>

100
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,679
<i>Agreed?</i>

101
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>No objections.</i>

102
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,058
If it's this weekend,
there's not much time left!

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,062
Light, you know the cell phone numbers
of those seven, right?

104
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,313
Yeah.

105
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,898
Any one of them will do.

106
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm going to call one of the seven
to try and stop the murders!

107
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,319
Please wait.

108
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,408
If we do that just three days
after Aiber's made contact with them,

109
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,411
we'll arouse suspicion that
our investigation is catching up to them.

110
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,580
It's also highly likely

111
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,750
that we won't be able to
determine who Kira is.

112
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,878
We've come this far,

113
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,713
and we'll have to start over again.

114
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,094
To catch Kira...

115
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,513
we need proof.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,354
Ryuzaki, if Kira is among these seven,

117
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,940
isn't it fair to assume that
if we call one of them...

118
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,777
there's a one in seven chance that
that person is Kira?

119
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,947
At most, I would think there's
two of them.

120
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,283
So it's two out of seven...

121
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,952
If we're prepared to let them know

122
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,871
that the investigation is
catching up to them,

123
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,040
then let's risk it on those odds.

124
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,584
I'm going to borrow
the name Ryuzaki.

125
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,377
From the sound of the conversation...

126
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,962
the one who seems the least
likely to be Kira

127
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,132
and who carries some
weight on the board is...

128
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,134
- Ooi!
- Namikawa.

129
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,679
If you're going to make a call,
use this phone.

130
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,849
It can't be traced or tapped.

131
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,978
I really think it would
be faster if...

132
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,190
we killed the executives of
our rival companies one by one.

133
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,484
That would be going a bit far.

134
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,611
Let's kill them and
split their stocks.

135
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,821
<i>You're Reiji Namikawa,</i>

136
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,407
<i>the V. P. of Yotsuba Group's
Sales Department One, aren't you?</i>

137
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,160
Yes, I am... and?

138
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,955
<i>Listen and respond as you see ﬁt.</i>

139
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,082
<i>lam L.</i>

140
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,673
<i>I've planted cameras and wires
in that meeting room...</i>

141
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,384
<i>and I'm recording footage
of your entire meeting.</i>

142
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,095
The opening topic
was Mr. Hatori's death.

143
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,098
Now you're deciding on who to kill.

144
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,016
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

145
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,268
<i>He's been watching everything!</i>

146
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,479
If you aren't Kira...

147
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,191
or if you aren't someone who
can directly contact Kira...

148
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,693
<i>then let's make a deal.</i>

149
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,236
<i>A deal?!</i>

150
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>Delay the death of E.L.F. 's president
and Mr. Zenzai one month.</i>

151
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>This shouldn't be difﬁcult for you.</i>

152
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,289
- Yes, I see...
- If we want to randomize the deaths...

153
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,958
- Yes... Go on...
- just throw darts at a calendar.

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,501
If you do this,

155
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,297
and cooperate with us from now on,
your crime... no...

156
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,050
<i>everyone other than
Kira will not be charged...</i>

157
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,094
<i>under the belief that they were
threatened by Kira</i>

158
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,595
<i>into participating in the meetings.</i>

159
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,889
Ah... I see...

160
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,434
<i>My only option is join L.</i>

161
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,895
<i>No, I'll be killed if Kira ﬁnds out
that I've sided with L.</i>

162
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>What should I do?</i>

163
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,400
If you reveal this conversation,
it'll cause a panic.

164
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,569
There would be no advantage for you.

165
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,946
Everyone will be caught.

166
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,783
But my goal is to go
one-on-one against Kira.

167
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>Listen... If L wins against Kira,
you'll be acquitted.</i>

168
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>If Kira wins against me,
you'll carry on with your luxurious life.</i>

169
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,297
<i>Or you can remain a spectator and
go along with either side.</i>

170
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,926
Whoever wins, L or Kira,
it's no loss to you.

171
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,014
<i>However, it would be a loss
to you if you were caught right now.</i>

172
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,435
<i>He already knows the answer
I would have given.</i>

173
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,937
<i>That's all...</i>

174
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,481
Okay. On Monday...

175
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,902
What's wrong, Namikawa?
Who was it from?

176
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,613
Nothing, a subordinate of mine
messed up

177
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,947
and I'll have to fix it on Monday.

178
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,951
Sorry for interrupting.
Let's get back on topic.

179
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,039
Regarding on when we should kill
those E.L.F. guys and Zenzai.

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,167
How about this?

181
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,212
We give Coil one month
to discover L's identity.

182
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:53,384
If he doesn't, we'll be forced to
kill them at various dates.

183
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,180
Next, we'll give him another month
and repeat the process.

184
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,807
Once we've dealt with L,

185
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,975
we'll go back to two to
three people a week.

186
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,396
In other words, we should make
dealing with L our first priority.

187
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,524
I see...

188
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,652
Indeed. If we kill L,
we won't have anything in our way.

189
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,987
Until then, we should be careful...

190
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,448
Yeah... It sounds good to me.

191
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,369
Well, we've got to be
extremely careful.

192
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,413
Then we'll give Coil one month.

193
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,165
No objections.

194
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>L... that should satisfy you...</i>

195
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>But we'll still hold these meetings
every week. That's all for now.</i>

196
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,966
It went well...

197
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,384
Yeah...

198
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,511
You really are amazing, Light.

199
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,472
Not only did you delay the killing,

200
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,684
we may be able to get
information from Namikawa.

201
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,020
Furthermore, it looked like
something I would do...

202
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,606
You thought of it faster than I did.

203
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,067
At this rate...

204
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,404
If I die...

205
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,074
you could probably become
the successor to the "L" name...

206
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,118
Why are you talking about
such morbid things?

207
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,872
We have a month to figure out
Kira's identity

208
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,832
and gather evidence against him.

209
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,792
The challenge is just beginning.

210
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,169
Yes...

211
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,797
But you're the one who
first noticed Yotsuba.

212
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,134
You may be more capable than I am.

213
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,596
You might be able to do it.

214
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,308
If I die...

215
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,895
would you take over for me as L?

216
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,955
If I die, would you take over for me?

217
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,874
As L.

218
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,420
<i>If this is all an act and he is Kira,
he's sure to say yes...</i>

219
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,340
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

220
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,843
As long as we have this,
won't we die together?

221
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,680
I get it...

222
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,307
Sorry Ryuzaki...

223
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,394
I'm going to tell everyone
what you're thinking.

224
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,565
Ryuzaki thinks that if I'm Kira,

225
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,403
I'm either just pretending I'm not him
and putting on an act...

226
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,906
or that Kira's power has been
passed to someone else...

227
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,201
...and I have no memory
that I was Kira.

228
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,370
One of those two possibilities.

229
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,374
If it's the first...
If I'm putting on an act,

230
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,542
these handcuffs will never come off.

231
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,796
No, even if it was
the other possibility,

232
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,214
he probably wouldn't take them off.

233
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,425
Ryuzaki thinks that I'm Kira.

234
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,553
Even if that power has been
passed to someone else...

235
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,390
he assumes that I would have
planned things

236
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,891
to have it return to me again.

237
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,895
In other words, he doesn't think
I was being controlled.

238
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,314
I passed the power on

239
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,943
and planned for it to come back
to me once I've been cleared.

240
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,073
<i>Amazing... You ﬁgured out
exactly what I was thinking.</i>

241
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,658
Ryuzaki's line of reasoning is,

242
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,121
"Light will become Kira
once he steals L's position. "

243
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,164
Correct.

244
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,500
To acquire the position of L...

245
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,420
and be able to freely control
the police,

246
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,921
while being Kira in secret...

247
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,965
would be the ultimate.

248
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,261
<i>I could do that... no, I would do it.</i>

249
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,804
That's what you meant, didn't you?

250
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,056
Yes.

251
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,683
But what about now?

252
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,396
You should know by now that
I'm probably not acting.

253
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,443
If you were acting and
trying to steal my position as L...

254
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,487
there's no way that you'd reveal
your plan in front of everyone.

255
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,281
Is that what you mean?

256
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
Ryuzaki...

257
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,874
Even if I capture the current Kira...

258
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,500
do you really think...

259
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,544
that I'd become Kira, a murderer?

260
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,172
Do I look like that kind of person?

261
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,430
That's what I think,
and that's how you look.

262
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,190
Not again...

263
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,359
Okay! Once is enough!

264
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,111
Let's just leave it as a draw!

265
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,364
Yeah...

266
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,700
Anyways, we have to catch the Kira
that's in front of our eyes.

267
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,870
As long as I have the handcuffs,
you shouldn't have any complaints.

268
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,041
I suppose so.
We only have a month.

269
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,002
- Ryuzaki...
- Yes?

270
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,546
If we can use
that meeting as evidence,

271
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,967
and capture the seven of them,
won't the murders of criminals stop?

272
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,552
<i>Not again...</i>

273
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
Unfortunately, no.

274
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,014
No?

275
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,184
We're not sure if Kira
is among those seven.

276
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,439
If they just have a connection to him,
Kira will simply kill them.

277
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,901
We have to be absolutely sure
that Kira is among them,

278
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,278
or there's no point in
catching them now.

279
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,822
Even if he is...

280
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,200
it's difficult to determine
who's Kira right now.

281
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,453
I think it's still too early.

282
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:17,083
But, if you can't say that
he's definitely among the seven...

283
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,087
there's still a chance that the murders
will stop if we arrest them.

284
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,591
It's like my dad says.
There is a chance.

285
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,843
Um, on second thought...

286
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,596
I think I'll go after Kira by myself.

287
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,768
You can use these headquarters,
as will I.

288
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,940
You can do things your way
and arrest them if you wish.

289
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,360
I shall investigate as
I wish in my own way.

290
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,029
We'll only get into arguments
if we don't.

291
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,948
Let's split up and act separately.

292
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,536
In other words, you just want to
figure out who Kira is, huh?

293
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,915
Yes. This case will never be solved
if we don't capture Kira.

294
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,751
I can't say that stopping
the deaths of a number of people

295
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,837
right before our eyes, is meaningless...

296
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,133
But if we don't find the truth,

297
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,219
Kira will appear again and
the victims will increase in the end.

298
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,512
That's why...

299
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,516
I think it's more important
to figure out who Kira is.

300
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,729
I'm opposed to arresting
the seven men,

301
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,815
if you want to do that,
then you take responsibility for it.

302
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,818
I will pursue Kira by myself.

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,653
We only have one month.

304
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,239
I wonder who will be faster?

305
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
Ryuzaki... Where are you going?

306
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,660
Amane's room.

307
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,997
Sorry, Light, I know
you're on your father's side, but...

308
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,417
I can't remove these handcuffs,
so you're going to have to come with me.

309
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,221
Light! Did we have a date today?

310
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,056
Along with Mr. Ryuzaki...

311
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,099
Misa...

312
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,769
Do you love Light?

313
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,231
Yes... very much.

314
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,566
But you also worship Kira.

315
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,276
Yes...

316
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,696
So who would you pick,
Light or Kira?

317
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,242
Light, of course.

318
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,286
What? I'm grateful to Kira
and want to meet him,

319
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,914
but that's not love.
Definitely Light.

320
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,291
Light wants to catch Kira.

321
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418
Isn't that right, Light?

322
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,337
Yeah. Of course.

323
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,216
It seems he wants to catch him.
Now what'll you do?

324
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,761
If Light wants to catch him,
then I want Light to catch him.

325
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,723
So would you want to help
Light by working with him...

326
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,642
on the investigation?

327
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,143
Ryuzaki!

328
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,355
Yeah! I'll do anything for Light!

329
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,899
Wait a second.
What are you thinking?!

330
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,987
Aiber will pose as Eraldo Coil
and tell those seven men that...

331
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,907
he learned that Misa Amane might
be able to identify L.

332
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,868
And that L brought her in
for questioning

333
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,288
because he suspected that
she was the Second Kira.

334
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,582
<i>Well, that £9 true.</i>

335
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,502
If they know that Misa Amane
might know L...

336
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,256
they'll have her appear in
their commercials

337
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,758
and try to ask her about
various things.

338
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,094
Since Mr. Matsuda's screw up...

339
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,431
there were talks about using her
in their commercials.

340
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,391
Yeah. Yeah.

341
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,435
- That's no good.
- Why?

342
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,354
Because it would subject
you to danger.

343
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,316
Huh?! You're worried about me?

344
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,609
Yay!

345
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,196
But this is nothing if it's for you.

346
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,492
Listen, Misa, if they know that
you might know who L is...

347
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,704
we don't know what means they'll use
to get that information out of you.

348
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,708
It's all right. I won't say anything
under any kind of torture.

349
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,501
Yes. That is true...

350
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,005
Besides, Kira can control
his victims' actions before death.

351
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,590
There is a good chance that

352
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,051
he might try to get her
to talk and kill her.

353
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,970
No, if he kills L, then he won't have
any use for her and

354
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,473
Kira would kill Misa
to keep her silent.

355
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,016
I wouldn't like that...

356
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,476
Light.

357
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,521
If we win, Misa won't die.

358
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,440
Also...

359
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,652
as long as we're handcuffed,
we'll share the same fate.

360
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,113
If I die, you'll die too.

361
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,617
In that case, Misa is the one
who would grieve the most.

362
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,704
It's either we both die,
or we catch Kira.

363
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,331
Now which will you choose?

364
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,210
Catch Kira!
I can't live in a world without Light.

365
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,419
Yes, that's correct.

366
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,254
Hey, Ryuzaki, that's messed up.

367
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,007
We have no time.
I'm desperate.

368
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:40,262
Besides, Misa Amane's...
bravery and love for you...

369
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,806
are the greatest in the world.

370
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,849
Ryuzaki...

371
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,437
I think I've been wrong
about you all this time.

372
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,189
I called you a pervert and all...

373
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,693
You really do understand me!

374
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,614
Yes. Misa is the perfect,
most worthy woman for Light.

375
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,366
Yay!

376
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,576
Thank you, Ryuzaki.

377
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,079
I could fall in love with you,
you know.

378
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,831
Uh... That's a little...

379
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,334
How about being friends, Ryuzaki?

380
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,754
Yes. I've made another friend.

381
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah. All of Light's friends
are my friends.

382
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,970
<i>Let's all be friends!</i>

383
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,430
<i>Yay!</i>

384
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,935
And I'll never betray
any of my friends.

385
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,521
With our powers combined,
let's arrest Kira!

386
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,022
No, but...

387
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,025
Yagami is taking a different
investigative approach from us

388
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,736
and will be working with
his father and the others.

389
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,321
You and I will be together, Misa.

390
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,906
Huh? What's up with that?

391
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,867
That was dirty, Ryuzaki.

392
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,995
Now my only choice is to
join your investigation...

393
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,455
No, that's quite all right.

394
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,416
What are you talking about?
Light will be joining us!

395
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,917
No, it's not like that...

396
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm opposed to this investigation.
It's too dangerous for you.

397
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,423
Light...

398
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,759
Thank you for thinking about me.

399
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,763
But let me do this.
I want to be of use to you.

400
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,516
I want to be of use to you and
I want you to love me even more.

401
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,268
Plus, I...

402
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,188
<i>would gladly die for you.</i>

403
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,858
Right now, it will be difficult
to arrest the seven of them...

404
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,237
Mogi, Matsuda,
do you have any good ideas?

405
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,659

Director Nishinaka,
Light and the others...

423
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,280
And now even the Shinigami's
asking me to act!

424
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,906
This is a lot of work.

425
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,577
It looks like I might be in
a big commercial. I am so popular!
