00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,547
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,602
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,323
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,790
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,382
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:17,369
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,590
OVERCAST

17
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,558
<i>Regardless of how she came to
her conclusion,</i>

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,019
<i>she knows the truth.</i>

19
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,272
<i>If she gives this information
to the police...</i>

20
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,318
<i>they'll ﬁgure out that
Light Yagami equals Kira.</i>

21
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,445
<i>I have to ﬁnish her off.</i>

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,488
What's wrong?

23
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,533
Oh, nothing...

24
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,872
I've been going over
what you just told me

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,542
and I think that we should investigate
that theory as soon as possible.

26
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,419
Really?

27
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,879
Yes.

28
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,714
Have you told this to anyone else?

29
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,216
No, you're the first.

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,553
You're lucky.

31
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,430
But how are you going to
eliminate her?

32
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,641
Wouldn't it be bad
if you did it here?

33
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,144
<i>I've already ﬁgured that out...
without you telling me.</i>

34
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,980
Wow! So out in the open.

35
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,026
Could you tell me the date
and time of the bus-jacking incident?

36
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,488
It was on December 20,
in front of Asagao Hill.

37
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,866
At 11:02.
Headed to Space Land.

38
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,414
December 20.
Headed to Space Land, right?

39
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,749
Yes.

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,503
SHOKO MAKI
SUICIDE JANUARY 1, 2007

41
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,423
COMMITS SUICIDE IN A WAY THAT NOBCDDY VVILL BE INCONVENIENCED AND HER BODY
WILL NOT BE DISCOVERED. DIES BY IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN WITHIN 48 HOURS.

42
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,594
<i>Now no one will ﬁnd her body.</i>

43
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,554
<i>Even if they do ﬁnd her,</i>

44
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,557
<i>they'll assume that she killed herself
because of her ﬁance.</i>

45
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,271
<i>Ryuk, what's so funny?</i>

46
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,572
I'm very sorry for questioning
all of you individually.

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,450
Kira is not one of us.

48
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,997
Ryuzaki, how can you definitely
say that he's not among us?

49
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:31,670
To be honest, I set some traps
to check if you were Kira, but...

50
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,507
I didn't feel the need to
set them on any of you.

51
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,345
Excuse me.

52
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,935
<i>After he told us to
turn off our cell phones...!</i>

53
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,645
I got it.

54
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,313
I'm just about finished.

55
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,399
Enter with your key.

56
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,861
Watari is on his way.

57
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,864
I understand.

58
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,617
If it's all right,
I'll report this incident.

59
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,997
No, I'd like to report it myself.

60
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,001
After talking to you, I've decided to
do it as soon as possible.

61
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,671
I suppose you're right.

62
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,469
<i>Just ten seconds until 1:15...</i>

63
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>I want to see how this woman dies,
but I can't be caught following her.</i>

64
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>Go on.. hurry to your death!</i>

65
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,705
Kira will definitely
be caught, won't he?

66
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,507
<i>What's wrong? The time has passed...</i>

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>That's odd.</i>

68
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>Why isn't this woman leaving?</i>

69
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,641
<i>My tests have proved that</i>

70
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>I've proved many times that
I should be able</i>

71
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>to control her within
these circumstances.</i>

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,572
<i>$0 Why?</i>

73
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>Ryuk...</i>

74
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

75
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,917
<i>he was laughing oddly when
I was writing in the Death Note...</i>

76
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,752
<i>That's not all.</i>

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>The way he laughed when I asked
for her name was also bizarre...</i>

78
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>Both were times when something had
to do with her name...</i>

79
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,636
<i>An alias!</i>

80
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,565
Thank you all for working so hard.

81
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,609
T- This person is Watari?

82
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,778
Um, where are your usual clothes?

83
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,364
If I had dressed like I usually do,

84
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,116
it would be like telling everyone
I'm Watari.

85
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,703
It would also give away Ryuzaki's
location in this hotel.

86
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,663
|- | see.

87
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:18,295
Showing my face in front of you
all means you've won Ryuzaki's trust.

88
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,881
|- | feel kind of honored...

89
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,178
Ryuzaki, I've brought what
you've requested.

90
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,514
Please pass them out to everyone.

91
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
Yes.

92
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,354
These are everyone's new police IDs.

93
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,981
New?

94
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,819
<i>An alias.
That's the only thing it could be!</i>

95
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,823
<i>Ryuk can see her real name.</i>

96
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,034
<i>That's why he was laughing.</i>

97
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,829
<i>This woman was being careful
from the start.</i>

98
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,664
<i>That's right.</i>

99
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,752
<i>She believes that Raye died...
because he showed his ID.</i>

100
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,714
<i>That's why she's acting without
revealing her identity.</i>

101
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,507
<i>This isn't good.</i>

102
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,093
<i>It's even harder to ask
for the real name</i>

103
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,471
<i>of someone who has already
given an alias.</i>

104
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,599
<i>If I keep asking her persistently,
she'll get suspicious.</i>

105
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,686
<i>More importantly, it's suspicious
that I knew she was using an alias.</i>

106
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,482
I should be getting back soon.

107
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,235
Someone might have come back.

108
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,197
Oh, yeah.
I suppose you're right.

109
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,407
Hopefully, someone did.

110
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,076
Yes.

111
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>Damn it...!</i>

112
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>It would also be unnatural
to try to turn her back.</i>

113
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,756
<i>What should I do? At this rate...</i>

114
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,841
<i>Oh no...</i>

115
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,219
<i>If my father calls...</i>

116
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,805
<i>I promised her that I'd let her
talk to him!</i>

117
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,182
<i>It's all over if he calls!</i>

118
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>What do I do?</i>

119
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:02,107
<i>What am I thinking about?
I can just turn off my cell phone.</i>

120
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,318
<i>Calm down.</i>

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,405
<i>I just have to ﬁnd out her name.</i>

122
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>Her purse, her pocket,
she's got to have a driver's license...</i>

123
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,953
<i>or some sort of personal ID
on her somewhere.</i>

124
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>She's a woman.</i>

125
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,540
<i>If it comes down to it,
I can use force...</i>

126
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,709
<i>That's stupid!</i>

127
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,044
<i>I can '1' do anything that'll
cause a stir here- -.</i>

128
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>I've got to get her to
somewhere isolated.</i>

129
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,425
<i>Where? What explanation
can I offer...</i>

130
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,428
<i>...this extremely cautious woman?</i>

131
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,014
<i>No, I've got to change
my plan of attack...</i>

132
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,348
<i>I can do this.</i>

133
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,726
<i>I can get her name without
setting any alarms off.</i>

134
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,604
Light.

135
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,441
We can do that eye deal anytime...

136
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,068
It's no different from putting
on contact lenses.

137
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,695
It takes just a few seconds.

138
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>I won't have my remaining life
halved by the likes of this woman.</i>

139
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,495
<i>No, I won't ever consider the deal!</i>

140
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
<i>Don't bother me.</i>

141
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,623
<i>Shut up, Shinigami!</i>

142
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,334
Excuse me.

143
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,461
Yes?

144
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,213
Do you still have business
at the police department?

145
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,883
I'll be all right by myself.

146
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,219
I understand.

147
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,431
Our names and ranks are all fake.

148
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,892
Fake police IDs?!

149
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,520
Kira requires a name
and a face to kill.

150
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,274
We are challenging Kira
with that premise in mind.

151
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,026
This is only natural.

152
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,613
B- But a police officer
with a fake ID is...

153
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,158
No, if Kira needs a name to kill,

154
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,496
an alias would go a long way
in protecting our lives.

155
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,498
We should carry these around.

156
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,416
I think so, too.

157
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,584
Yeah.

158
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,379
When you have to give out
your name to strangers,

159
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,216
use the alias in your IDs.

160
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,675
Yes.

161
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,387
Please be careful not to use them

162
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,889
inside the police headquarters.

163
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,183
It could cause problems.

164
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,143
Understood.

165
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:07,524
Well then...
I want everyone to wear these belts.

166
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,817
Belts?

167
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,362
There is a tracking device
in the buckle.

168
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,698
This way, Ryuzaki will know
your whereabouts.

169
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,118
And when you press
the buckle twice...

170
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,205
My cell phone will ring.

171
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,709
And I'll call you back immediately.

172
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,672
In the morning, you will go to work
at the police department.

173
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,715
Later, using this method...

174
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,344
I shall confirm our hotel
and room number.

175
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,139
Please use this
for emergencies as well.

176
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,057
This is kind of cool.

177
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,643
It's like we're a special force
chasing Kira!

178
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:44,978
Matsuda!

179
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,563
This isn't child's play.

180
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,314
Don't joke around.

181
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,941
Okay.. -

182
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,443
Thank you very much.

183
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,531
Thanks to you, I have gained
confidence in my theory.

184
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,074
Not at all...

185
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,417
<i>Since Ryuk brought up the eye deal...</i>

186
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>There's no doubt.
She's using an alias.</i>

187
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>At this rate, with her theory that
Kira was on the bus...</i>

188
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,595
<i>and given the people Raye Penber
was tasked to investigate,</i>

189
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,847
<i>the police will immediately suspect me.</i>

190
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,852
Hey, she's leaving.
Is that okay?

191
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,106
<i>It should be about ﬁve minutes until
she reaches the police headquarters...</i>

192
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>Think...</i>

193
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,111
<i>How can I get her name
within ﬁve minutes?</i>

194
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,293
<i>She's going to
the police headquarters.</i>

195
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,631
<i>If someone from the task force
has returned, I'm ﬁnished.</i>

196
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,885
<i>Somehow, I've got to ﬁnd out
her real name and eliminate her...</i>

197
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,305
<i>Now there are only three minutes until
she reaches the police headquarters.</i>

198
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,641
<i>All right.</i>

199
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,644
What are you going to do?

200
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,895
Excuse me.

201
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,979
Yes?

202
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,149
There's something I haven't told you.

203
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,317
Okay.. -

204
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,489
It's impossible to contact anyone
directly in headquarters.

205
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,117
<i>I have to conduct this conversation
naturally and</i>

206
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>connect it to something
that she'll latch onto.</i>

207
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,665
<i>Within that time,
I'll draw out her name.</i>

208
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,583
<i>I can do this.</i>

209
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,835
What do you mean?

210
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,964
Don't you think that it's odd
that there's no one at headquarters?

211
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,507
Y- Yes.

212
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,592
I thought it was strange, but...

213
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:45,848
The team investigating Kira is structured
so no one knows who is involved.

214
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,188
If the general public knows how
the team is structured,

215
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,192
a tragedy like the one involving
your fiancé may happen again...

216
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,782
I understand.

217
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,869
That's why you were told
that no one was at the headquarters.

218
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,539
In other words,

219
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,043
you will never be allowed to talk
directly to someone from headquarters.

220
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,882
<i>That's good, Light.</i>

221
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,636
Why do you know so much?

222
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,889
She's pretty sharp.

223
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,478
I guess I have no choice.
I shall tell you...

224
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,190
It's because I'm a member of
the task force.

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,736
You're part of the task force?

226
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,154
Yes.

227
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,365
L is currently in charge
of the task force.

228
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,201
Yes, I thought so.

229
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,414
L was troubled because there weren't
enough detectives at headquarters.

230
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,667
Many quit because
they're afraid of Kira.

231
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm just a high school student, but...

232
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:02,258
I've helped the police
solve two cases in the past.

233
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,053
So he was convinced by that...?

234
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,930
I can enter the headquarters
whenever I wish,

235
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,933
and I'm allowed to investigate
on my own.

236
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,271
In other words, the people who
are currently at task force headquarters...

237
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,608
are the chosen few who...

238
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:22,403
are trusted and highly qualified

239
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,917
I understand.

240
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,962
But just in case,
I think I'll visit the headquarters.

241
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,798
Thank you very much.

242
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,135
Please wait!

243
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,098
I just told you that
you can't talk to anyone.

244
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,309
I would like to talk directly to L.

245
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,484
Come to think of it,
who's at headquarters now?

246
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,611
Right now, no one.

247
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,154
That's not good.

248
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,491
Have at least one person
there at all times.

249
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,826
Understood.

250
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,994
Aizawa, if you could
stay there for today...

251
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,997
Okay. I can get there
quickly from here.

252
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,500
Ms. Maki, please wait.

253
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,585
It's impossible to meet L.

254
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,170
It's useless.

255
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,137
He might... allow me to meet him.

256
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,012
What?

257
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,307
I only followed his orders from
beyond a computer screen, but...

258
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:39,439
Two years ago in America
I worked on a case under L.

259
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,191
You worked under L?

260
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,864
Until three months ago,
I was an FBI agent.

261
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,201
<i>This is it...
I can use this.</i>

262
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,704
Is that so?

263
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:59,709
It's no wonder. Your actions are
not amateurish.

264
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,546
You move carefully and wisely
as you get to the heart of the matter.

265
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,840
I'd like to learn from you.

266
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,219
It's amazing how you can
line up all those lies like that.

267
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,473
I must approach this case
in my own way.

268
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:18,060
I have to suspect the police
and even the people within task force.

269
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,980
But I trust L.

270
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,734
I thought that
if I went to headquarters

271
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:30,740
and have them verify my name and face...
I'd be able to speak directly to L.

272
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,533
I see...

273
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,579
But why did you tell me that
you wanted to talk to L?

274
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,916
When I wasn't allowed to see
someone from the task force,

275
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,877
I was angry and then
I ran into someone

276
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,254
who claimed to be
the son of the lead detective...

277
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,924
No, that's not it.

278
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,927
I'll tell you the truth.

279
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,596
You seemed like L.

280
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,266
I felt that you two are similar.

281
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,402
Shall we investigate
the case together?

282
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,403
Huh?

283
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,449
Will you work as
a member in the task force?

284
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,078
Of course,
not just anybody is allowed.

285
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,706
But we need people like you!

286
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,752
You could be doing more than
gathering general information.

287
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,588
You were an FBI agent.

288
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,758
You're more talented than
our current detectives.

289
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,302
Even L trusted you.

290
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,640
To join the task force,
you need proper identification,

291
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,434
a recommendation from
a current detective on the team,

292
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,728
and finally L's permission.

293
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,981
You want me to join
the task force?

294
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,651
It's fate that we met here!

295
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,320
I'll recommend you!

296
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,993
Oh, sorry.

297
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,995
I just got a little excited...

298
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,580
N- No, it's okay...

299
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,667
Even if you can cooperate
with the investigation,

300
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,086
I understand you have personal
circumstances to attend to.

301
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,505
Especially since you live in America...

302
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,342
I was planning to continue living
with my fiancé in America,

303
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,595
he and I were to be
married this spring.

304
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,847
But now that he's dead...

305
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,350
I have no idea what I'll do now...

306
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,518
<i>All right...</i>

307
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,146
<i>I've come this far,
I just have to push a little bit...</i>

308
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,357
But you're still very young
and beautiful.

309
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,610
You shouldn't be involved
in such a dangerous investigation...

310
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,863
No! I don't have anything to lose.

311
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,323
I want to catch Kira!

312
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,825
It's all I want to do!

313
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,994
Please let me investigate with you!

314
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,463
Thank goodness.

315
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,300
Well, may I see something that may act
as some form of personal ID?

316
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,385
Well...

317
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,637
Yes?

318
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,350
Actually, that name I gave you earlier
was not my real name...

319
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,893
I'm very sorry.

320
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,480
That's all right.

321
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,192
Amazing! Who would have thought
you were being so careful?

322
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,319
You're one step ahead of me.

323
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,572
That's even further proof
that you're qualified.

324
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,075
Is a Japanese driver's license okay?

325
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,409
Yes.

326
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,763
<i>I made it...</i>

327
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,349
NAOMI MISORA DOB 2/11/1979

328
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,934
NAOMI MISORA SUICIDE 1/1/2007 COMMITS SUICIDE IN A WAY THAT NOBODY WILL BE INCONVENIENCED
AND HER BODY VVILL NOT BE DISCOVERED. DIES BY IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN WITHIN 48 HOURS.

329
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,283
Excuse me, but why do you
keep looking at your watch?

330
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,619
Oh... this?

331
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,372
It's because...

332
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,043
I'm Kira.

333
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,950
What's the matter?

334
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,245
There's something I have to do.

335
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
Oh.

336
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,668
My father's cell phone is on now.

337
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,129
Don't you want to talk to him?

338
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,674
I have nothing I want to talk about.

339
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,345
Good bye, Miss Naomi Misora.

340
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,868
TO BE CONTINUED

341
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,208
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

342
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:37,671
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

343
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>I'm holding these feelings
that I can't give up in my heart</i>

344
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

345
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,650
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

346
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,239
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

347
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:07,076
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

348
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,746
