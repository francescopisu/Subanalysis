00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

2
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,317
<i>Easy easy banzai Easy easy banzai
Easy easy banzai Human</i>

3
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:31,448
<i>Wanna get them mad? Get them mad?
Get them mad? People</i>

4
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,535
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

5
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,496
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern
Crime won't disappear Forever</i>

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>What's up? Full of causes for concern</i>

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

9
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>Hey Hey! A hymn to humanity
Love has gone People, are you worried?</i>

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>Hey Hey! Subservient People!</i>

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

16
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,528
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

17
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

18
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?!</i>

19
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,288
<i>Are you worried?</i>

20
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,709
What seems to be the trouble, Ryuzaki?

21
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,219
What's wrong?

22
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:03,016
SILENCE

23
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:11,274
The corner of this page from
this killer notebook is ripped out.

24
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,819
Would someone still die
if their name was written

25
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,945
on the part that has been cut out?

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,655
Who knows?

27
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,991
I haven't used it in that way,
so I don't know.

28
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,037
Then do Shinigami only eat apples?

29
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,497
No.

30
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,169
But a Shinigami's organs are devolved...
no, evolved.

31
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,796
So there's no need for us to eat...

32
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,173
Yagami...

33
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,430
You've finally been freed,
but hardly leave the headquarters...

34
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,641
Even if Misa comes to visit,

35
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,143
you only chat with her
for a few minutes.

36
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,021
You're free to go outside and
have a love life, you know.

37
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,567
We still haven't solved the Kira case.

38
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,486
I'm not in the mood for love.

39
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,116
Or, are you trying to say that
I'm a nuisance if I stay here?

40
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,618
No...

41
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,479
<i>Right now, I'm in no position
to be punishing criminals.</i>

42
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,982
<i>Misa, punish them for me.</i>

43
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,782
<i>Misa...
Let's make a new world together.</i>

44
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>Be... careful.</i>

45
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,813
<i>God... is watching.</i>

46
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:21,488
<i>Please hold my hand...
In the dark alley.</i>

47
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,742
<i>Even if I'm alone
and far away...</i>

48
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>You'll always...
find me...</i>

49
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:40,048
<i>You tell me...
everything you know.</i>

50
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,720
<i>Even if...
I don't remember...</i>

51
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,890
<i>You tell me...</i>

52
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:55,063
<i>many times.</i>

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,487
<i>But what do I do...</i>

54
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:11,746
<i>once I know everything?</i>

55
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,797
What's going on?

56
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,300
The murders of criminals have
begun again?

57
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,468
There were sixteen
just yesterday.

58
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,054
They were broadcast after
Higuchi died...

59
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,056
That's thorough, isn't it?

60
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,810
I guess that means that Higuchi
wasn't necessarily Kira...

61
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,313
No. We're positive that

62
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,940
Higuchi was the one killing criminals
until we caught him.

63
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,068
Then does that mean that
another Kira has appeared?

64
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,447
Why?!

65
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,407
Damn it... curse Kira...

66
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,328
<i>Kira appears now...
What's going on?</i>

67
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>What is going on?</i>

68
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,791
<i>There's only Misa...</i>

69
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,086
This happened as soon as
Misa was freed, didn't it?

70
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,507
Ryuzaki, are you still saying that?
Misa is not involved.

71
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,802
It happened as soon as Higuchi died.

72
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,804
You're right...

73
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,811
Well, if there is another notebook
and someone is using it...

74
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,149
I'll catch him.

75
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,158
<i>The Shinigami said
it didn't know, but...</i>

76
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,163
<i>If someone could kill by writing a name
on a clipping from the notebook...</i>

77
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,834
<i>It's not impossible...</i>

78
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,381
<i>But.. whoever writes
a name in this notebook...</i>

79
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,051
<i>Has to write another name
within thirteen days or die...</i>

80
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,222
<i>Light Yagami and
Misa Amane are alive...</i>

81
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,685
<i>Thirteen days...
This is the only...</i>

82
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,857
Ryuzaki, even if we do catch the person
who was writing in the notebook...

83
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,320
Can we really convict and punish him
as a serial killer?

84
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,615
Well, of course!

85
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,536
He wrote countless names knowing
that people would die.

86
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,413
We should kill him

87
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,999
if we don't want the existence
of the notebook to go public.

88
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,835
Killing him is harsh,

89
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,754
but I bet that's what our superiors
would demand.

90
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,717
If he admits to killing with
the notebook, he'd get the death penalty.

91
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,385
Or at least a life sentence.

92
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,055
Something like that.

93
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,559
<i>What are you thinking,
Light Yagami?</i>

94
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,562
<i>If Misa is caught,
you'll also be...</i>

95
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,566
<i>So that's it!</i>

96
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,027
<i>You bastard!</i>

97
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:54,409
<i>Light Yagami is sure that
I'll save Misa's life.</i>

98
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,120
<i>In order to save Misa
in this situation</i>

99
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,541
<i>I'll have to write
Ryuzaki's real name in my notebook.</i>

100
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,086
<i>And if I kill Ryuzaki...</i>

101
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>It will definitely affect
Misa's lifespan and I'll die as well...</i>

102
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>Light Yagami is making
everything go his way...</i>

103
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,769
<i>What are you going to do, Rem?</i>

104
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>I know completely that
despite being a Shinigami,</i>

105
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,690
<i>you care deeply about Misa.</i>

106
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,362
<i>Misa's life has been halved.
There's no way you'd abandon her.</i>

107
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,240
<i>Think about Misa's happiness.</i>

108
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,096
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?

109
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,354
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?!

110
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,827
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

111
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,873
Well, I'm not doing
anything in particular, but...

112
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,750
The sound of bells...

113
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,794
Bells...?

114
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,754
Yes.

115
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,841
The bells have been
really noisy today...

116
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,388
I don't hear anything.

117
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,765
Really?

118
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,393
They've been ringing
all day and...

119
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,104
I can't help but feel curious...

120
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,816
Do you suppose it's a church?
A wedding?

121
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,735
Or, perhaps...

122
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,236
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

123
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,031
Don't say such silly things.
Let's go back.

124
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,075
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,746
Everything I say is
complete nonsense, so...

126
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,915
please, don't believe any of it.

127
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,592
That's right, Ryuzaki.

128
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,970
Most of what you say is nonsense.

129
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,973
There would be no end if
I took you seriously all the time.

130
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,935
I know that the best.

131
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,105
Yes, that's right, Light.

132
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,611
But... it's true for both of us.

133
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:19,989
What do you mean?

134
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,663
Have you ever told the truth
at any point since you were born?

135
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,963
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

136
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,882
It's true, I lie once in a while.

137
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,427
But... how many people live
their entire lives

138
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,305
only telling the truth?

139
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,142
Humans aren't perfect.

140
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,186
Everyone lies.

141
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,188
Even so...

142
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,317
I've been careful not to
tell lies that hurt others.

143
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,319
That's my answer.

144
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,866
I thought you'd say that.

145
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,082
Let's go back. We're drenched.

146
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,710
Yeah.

147
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,098
Well, that was awful!

148
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,685
It's your fault.
You were standing in that rain.

149
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,980
You're right. I'm sorry.

150
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,740
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

151
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,700
I thought I'd help you...

152
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,994
Since you're enthusiastically
drying yourself off...

153
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,496
You don't have to do that.

154
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,498
I can give you a massage as well.

155
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,917
It's the least I can do to atone.

156
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,503
I'm pretty good at it.

157
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,298
Do as you please.

158
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,966
All right.

159
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
Hey...

160
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,726
You'll get used to it.

161
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,071
You're still wet.

162
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,141
It's sad...

164
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,976
What?

165
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,730
We'll soon part ways.

166
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,323
Yes?

167
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,619
All right. I'll come immediately.

168
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's go, Light.

169
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,545
It seems it went well.

170
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,267
Oh, Ryuzaki!
What is the meaning of this?!

171
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,561
I heard that you got approval
from another country

172
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,020
to use the notebook
for an execution!

173
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,815
Watari... Good job.

174
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,233
<i>Not at all.</i>

175
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,359
I know it's sudden, but let's...

176
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,112
make arrangements to
transport the notebook.

177
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,697
<i>Yes.</i>

178
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,615
Ryuzaki, what's the meaning of this?

179
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,035
It means that I'm going to
try out the notebook for real.

180
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,999
That's pointless!
We don't have to do that at this point!

181
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,501
We already know that the power
of the notebook is real, don't we?

182
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,212
Besides, who's going to
write the name?

183
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,380
Once you write in the notebook

184
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,384
you have to continue writing names
every thirteen days forever!

185
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,053
The one who's going to write
the name

186
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,016
is someone who'll be executed
within thirteen days.

187
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,059
If he's still alive after thirteen days...

188
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,354
we've made a deal
to commute his execution.

189
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,274
But we can't sacrifice people's lives...

190
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,609
Just a little more.

191
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,694
If we just clear this...

192
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,905
the case will be solved.

193
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,369
W- What's this?!

194
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,579
A blackout?!

195
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,508
<i>Watari?</i>

196
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,761
<i>Watari!</i>

197
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,683
Data deletion?
What's the meaning of this?!

198
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,395
I told Watari to erase all information...

199
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,233
in the event that something
happened to him.

200
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,401
If something happened?

201
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:08,903
Could it be?!

202
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,530
Where's the Shinigami?

203
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,198
Come to think of it, I don't see it...

204
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,701
It's not here!

205
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,119
What's the meaning of this?!

206
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,163
Everyone...
The Shinigaâ€!

207
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,488
Ryuzaki! What's wrong?!

208
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,305
Hey! Ryuzaki!

209
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,932
What's wrong?!
Get a hold of yourself!

210
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,851
- What happened?!
- What's going on...?

211
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,397
Calm down, Light!

212
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,857
We're going to be killed!

213
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,568
Watari, Ryuzaki, we're next!

214
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,208
Damn it!

215
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,169
Where are you, Shinigami?!
Come out!

216
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,046
Light!

217
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,257
You must know something!
Come out!

218
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,302
Let's search as well.

219
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,679
Yes!

220
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,055
Mogi, please take care of him.

221
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,473
Yes.

222
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,120
Everyone, come here.

223
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,081
What is this?

224
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,332
Sand?

225
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,500
What's going on?

226
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,587
Whatever it is... Whatever happened...

227
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,258
I will avenge Ryuzaki...

228
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,846
Solving this case will
be our gift...

229
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,475
to Watari and the other victims...
for all people...

230
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,936
Light...

231
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,312
That's right, Light.

232
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,442
Yeah, but... we're going to be killed.

233
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,902
Isn't that what this means?

234
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,948
Mr. Matsuda, if you're scared of dying,
leave the investigation.

235
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,201
Only people who have chosen to
risk their lives should be here.

236
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,704
Oh... no. That's right, but...

237
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,875
Light, don't talk like Ryuzaki...

238
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,684
<i>Everyone in my way is gone...</i>

239
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,154
