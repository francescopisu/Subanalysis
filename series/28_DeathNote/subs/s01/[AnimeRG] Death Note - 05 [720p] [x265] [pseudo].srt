00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:18,602

00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:39,790
<i>The dream into reality</i>

00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>The ending</i>

00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,446

00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,553
DECEMBER 20, 11:50 AM

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,441
Hey...

19
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,692
Yes?

20
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,237
I'm actually here in Japan on
a secret investigation.

21
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,532
If the Japanese police were to...

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,035
I understand.

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,787
I won't tell anyone that I met you.

24
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,789
Including my father...

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,542
Please excuse me...

26
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>It's just as I thought.</i>

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,008
<i>I also don't want the police
to know</i>

28
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,345
<i>that I've come into contact
with an FBI agent.</i>

29
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,681
<i>If my father ever found out,
he'd tell L.</i>

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,601
<i>Raye doesn't suspect me at all...</i>

31
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,979
<i>The police will deal with
what happened just now</i>

32
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>as a regular accident.</i>

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,081
Welcome back.

34
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,957
Good to be back.

35
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,296
What's the matter?
Why the big sigh?

36
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,798
Raye... What happened?

37
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,260
I got mixed up in a bus jacking.

38
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,179
A "bus-jacking"?

39
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,892
A man who robbed a bank
two days ago tried to hijack a bus.

40
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,561
Japan has become a scary place.

41
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,732
Does that mean you were
also riding on that bus?

42
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
Yeah.

43
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,405
In the end, the suspect jumped
out of the bus and was hit by a car.

44
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,908
Did the suspect die?

45
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,952
Yeah. Probably...

46
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,246
I didn't have any time to
watch what happened.

47
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,747
Raye...

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,418
Do you really think
that was an accident?

49
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,169
What do you mean?

50
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,130
Well, you were on that bus

51
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,923
because you were investigating
someone, weren't you?

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,592
The criminal probably died...

53
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,803
Doesn't that mean...

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,599
Hey, you were indeed once
a brilliant FBI agent.

55
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,686
But now you're my fiancée.

56
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,981
You're no longer an agent.

57
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,652
Don't say anything about
the Kira case.

58
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,571
Don't get involved or take risks.

59
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,531
That's what we agreed on

60
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,702
when I brought you with me here
so we could meet your parents.

61
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,163
I understand, Raye.

62
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,622
It's just a force of habit.

63
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,874
Sorry.

64
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,335
No, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,629
Once we have a family,

66
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,758
you'll be so busy that
you'll forget that you were an agent.

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,886
You won't have time
for that habit to come out.

68
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:28,310
Instead, help me think of something that
will make that father of yours like me more.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,605
Oh...

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,817
Are you going to write down
the name of the agent now?

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,988
No. I'm going to write his name
a week from today.

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,909
If he dies right after I meet him,
I'll look suspicious.

73
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,286
It would be better to do it

74
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,790
once they've investigated
more people involved with the police.

75
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,878
For now, I'll use some
more inmates to toy with L.

76
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,881
<i>L.</i>

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,886
<i>There is another dying
message left by a victim.</i>

78
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,554
Please send an image to me.

79
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,892
Gods of Death...

80
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,980
"L, do you know? Gods of Death. "

81
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,610
Does he want to say
that Gods of Death exist?

82
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,278
Watari.

83
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,865
Tell the police to keep
watch on the prison.

84
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,786
There may be someone else
who will leave a message.

85
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,746
<i>I understand.</i>

86
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,709
DECEMBER 27, 3:00 PM

87
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,174
There sure are a lot of humans...

88
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,968
Are you going to do it here?

89
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,970
I'll show you what I've learned

90
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,849
from all of the experiments and research
I've done in the past few days...

91
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,058
"Experiments"?

92
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,309
Yes.

93
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:56,982
I've been testing different killing
methods on the criminals in this area...

94
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,986
ACCIDENTAL DEATH DECEMBER 26, 8:30
PM DIES AFTER GETTING HIT BY A CAR.

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,489
Then, when I write a name
in afterwards, it becomes true.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,493
<i>That's something even I didn't know...</i>

97
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,328
He's here...

98
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,372
Right on time...

99
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,837
Mr. Raye Penber.

100
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,506
I'll kill you if you turn around.

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,092
I am Kira.

102
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,931
If you turn around or
put your hand in your pocket,

103
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,474
I Will kill you.

104
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,810
<i>I- It couldn't be...</i>

105
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,771
<i>But this voice...
I've heard it somewhere...</i>

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,066
I shall first prove to
you that I am Kira.

107
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,403
I'll kill the man
with the glasses...

108
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,449
working at the coffee shop
you are looking at.

109
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,992
T- That's impossible!

110
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,785
Don't do it!

111
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,459
I had no choice.

112
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,003
I thought that if I didn't kill
at least one person,

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,504
you wouldn't believe me.

114
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,301
That man has been repeatedly
accused of sexual assault,

115
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,137
but the police have never convicted
him due to lack of evidence.

116
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,390
He was a menace and
deserved to be punished.

117
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,977
You may already have
heard from L,

118
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:20,023
that I cannot kill someone
unless I know his face.

119
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:25,111
I could kill everyone you see here.

120
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,739
If you have any requests,
I'll do it.

121
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,658
D- Don't do it.

122
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,826
I believe that you're Kira...

123
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,081
Of course, you care more about
your loved ones more

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,293
than the people here, don't you?

125
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,172
Consider them hostages.

126
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,466
Y- You know about her?!

127
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,220
That's right.

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,305
I've been studying you.

129
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,517
I will kill everyone,

130
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,437
including your family if
you don't do exactly as I say.

131
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,147
You included, of course.

132
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,774
|- | understand.

133
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,484
What do you want me to do?

134
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,903
You have a computer
with you, don't you?

135
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,282
Is there a file on the agents
who've come to Japan?

136
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,495
My laptop is for work. I always
carry it around with me.

137
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,789
But those files aren't in it.

138
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,874
Then take this envelope.

139
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,465
First, take out the transceiver
and put on the earphone.

140
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>A transceiver...</i>

141
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,137
<i>It's almost like a toy...</i>

142
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,391
<i>But this won't leave
a transmission record anywhere</i>

143
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,269
<i>and we can converse at
close distances even underground.</i>

144
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,562
<i>He's thought this out.</i>

145
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,190
<i>Please take the Yamanote Line.</i>

146
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,610
<i>It doesn't matter if you take
the inner circle or outer circle.</i>

147
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,868
SHIBUYA - SHINAGAWA

148
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,537
<i>Even while you're on the train,
keep your eyes forward...</i>

149
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,122
<i>...focused on one spot.</i>

150
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>Don't forget, I can kill at any time.</i>

151
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,504
<i>Once you're on the train,
sit in the corner closest to the door.</i>

152
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>If it's taken, wait until it's free.</i>

153
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,442
<i>First, I must tell you something.</i>

154
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,904
<i>If your answer differs signiﬁcantly
from what I expect,</i>

155
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>I will kill your girlfriend.</i>

156
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,533
<i>Of the FBI agents who have
come to Japan,</i>

157
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,911
<i>how many are there and
how are they organized?</i>

158
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,662
<i>Please answer
into the transceiver.</i>

159
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,290
I've heard it's f-four teams...

160
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,000
a total of twelve people...

161
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,587
<i>Next, take out what's in the envelope.</i>

162
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,513
<i>What... is this?</i>

163
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,473
<i>Of those investigators...</i>

164
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,478
<i>Write the name of the agent
who is directly in charge of you all...</i>

165
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,897
<i>in the space at the top.</i>

166
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,399
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

167
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,818
<i>What is he planning?</i>

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,154
<i>But I have to do as he says.</i>

169
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,241
<i>He shouldn't be able to kill
with just names alone...</i>

170
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>Next, open your laptop.</i>

171
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,539
<i>You should be receiving
a ﬁle from your superior soon.</i>

172
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>A ﬁle of all the names and faces
of the FBI agents who came to Japan.</i>

173
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,629
<i>T- This is... What's going on?</i>

174
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>Now, like you just did,</i>

175
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,680
<i>take a good look at each agent's face as
you write their names on the envelope.</i>

176
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,516
<i>I don't understand.</i>

177
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,144
<i>What is Kira trying to do?</i>

178
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,396
<i>What is he doing?</i>

179
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,443
<i>It seems like you're done.</i>

180
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,655
Now put the transceiver and
envelope with the names on it

181
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,575
back into their original envelope
and put them on the rack.

182
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,244
Now put your hands on your lap
and continue riding the train

183
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>without making any movements for
about thirty minutes.</i>

184
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,707
<i>When you are sure that
nobody has noticed</i>

185
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,836
<i>that you have forgotten the envelope...
get off of the train.</i>

186
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,802
<i>Why? Why can't I remember
that voice?</i>

187
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,980
<i>Kira...</i>

188
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>Who are you?</i>

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
<i>Light... Yagami...</i>

190
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,173
Farewell, Raye Penber.

191
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,768
<i>Raye Penber wrote those names
on pages taken from the Death Note.</i>

192
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,940
<i>He unwittingly killed
all of his colleagues.</i>

193
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>Penber's superior died after sending him
the ﬁle on all of the agents.</i>

194
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,241
<i>The rest of the agents all died
of heart attacks</i>

195
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,534
<i>after the ﬁle was received.</i>

196
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>L... We have a call
from the Director of the FBI.</i>

197
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,889
It's me...

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,140
I've just got word
from Japan that

199
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,477
<i>all of our agents have died.</i>

200
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,689
They all died of heart attacks.

201
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,191
I can only think that
Kira killed them.

202
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,694
L, I'm very sorry, but...

203
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,823
The FBI will call off
our investigation in Japan.

204
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>It's from Chief Yagami.</i>

205
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,081
<i>L, I've just spoken with
the FBI Director.</i>

206
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,375
<i>According to him,</i>

207
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,338
<i>you were investigating everyone here
involved with the task force.</i>

208
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,507
Yes.

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,883
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

210
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,012
<i>Are you saying that you suspect us?</i>

211
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,308
I decided that it was necessary
to learn Kira's identity.

212
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,268
<i>I cannot condone this.</i>

213
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,729
<i>I cannot believe
that you would spy...</i>

214
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,064
on your colleagues...

215
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,776
We can't trust L...

216
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,280
Besides, Kira killed
those FBI agents, right?

217
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,032
Even if they're not criminals,

218
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,950
he'll kill anyone who
stands in his way!

219
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,329
<i>Kira's really just a murderer!</i>

220
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,833
<i>L. Another victim has
left a message.</i>

221
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,340
L, do you know? Gods of Death...

222
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,845
love apples...

223
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,306
<i>Damn you, Kira!</i>

224
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,731
Raye's... dead...

225
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,736
No, he was killed by Kira...

226
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,993
What? A family meeting?

227
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,830
Even if I kept it secret,
you'd find out sooner or later.

228
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,457
So I'm going to tell you now.

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:40,380
I am currently in charge of
conducting the Kira investigation.

230
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,298
No way!

231
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,051
Dad, you really are amazing.

232
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,553
That isn't what I wanted to say.

233
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,432
Yesterday...

234
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:58,022
twelve FBI agents,
sent to Japan to find Kira, died.

235
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,400
Does that mean that
they were killed by Kira?

236
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,484
What?!

237
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:06,406
It means Kira might kill anyone
who tries to apprehend him...

238
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,866
It's a cold
and ruthless crime

239
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,118
more fearsome than anything
we've encountered before.

240
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,994
Many of my officers have quit.

241
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,497
Dad, you should quit too!

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,791
I don't want you to die!

243
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,044
She's right. You should place
your life before your job.

244
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,006
No. I will not remove myself
from this case.

245
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,426
I will not yield to evil.

246
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,636
Dad...

247
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,929
Dear...

248
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:36,227
Dad, that's admirable.
I'm proud of you.

249
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
If anything ever happens to you,

250
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,692
I'll see that
Kira gets executed.

251
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,950
Kira will probably kill all who
oppose him,

252
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,702
even if they're not criminals.

253
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,122
We may all be killed by Kira...

254
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,210
Think of your lives,
your families, and friends.

255
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,756
If anyone wants to be removed
from this investigation, please resign.

256
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,135
If you resign,
you will not be demoted.

257
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,344
I promise you.

258
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,474
I want those with the confidence
to stay on the case to fight Kira,

259
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,811
even if going after him means
sacrificing everything.

260
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,980
That is all.

261
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,900
Hey...
What are you going to do?

262
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,234
Yeah...

263
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,446
Yeah, right, that's him.

264
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,199
I remember him because
he said, "Get down. "

265
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,243
But I don't really remember
the other passengers...

266
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
I see.

267
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,665
I understand.
Thank you very much.

268
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,547
<i>If what I'm thinking is correct,</i>

269
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,425
<i>Kira could have been
among those passengers...</i>

270
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,430
<i>If that's so, I can ﬁnd Kira
along the path this bus takes.</i>

271
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,974
SERIAL MURDER
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

272
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,984
Only five people, huh?
Six including myself.

273
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,615
No, I should say as many as five
of you are willing to risk your lives.

274
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,453
<i>I trust all of you who have
a strong sense of justice.</i>

275
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,623
W- Wait just a moment.

276
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,626
L says he trusts us, but...

277
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,420
We don't trust L.

278
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,676
L, we have decided to
risk our lives to catch Kira.

279
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,805
You should know what
we mean by that.

280
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,268
But you never show your face
and just order us around...

281
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,146
We cannot work with
someone like that!

282
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,151
L.

283
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,865
If you want to work with us
and want to catch Kira...

284
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,868
Would it be possible for
you to come here?

285
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:05,001
<i>Earlier, I said that I trust you all.</i>

286
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,887
PLEASE KEEP WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
A SECRET BETWEEN THE EIGHT OF US.

287
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,223
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE SIX OF YOU,
WHOM I TRUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

288
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,103
BEFORE THAT, I WANT YOU ALL TO GO
OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE BUILDING

289
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,565
AND DECIDE ONCE MORE
IF YOU TRUST ME OR NOT.

290
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,817
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY AND
NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION

291
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,320
Why does he suddenly
want to work with just the six of us?

292
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:37,450
If he's solved numerous difficult
cases by himself,

293
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,577
he should do the same
this time, too.

294
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,788
And judging by the way that L
has been conducting the investigation,

295
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,000
he'll probably send a double
to meet us.

296
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,128
A double, huh? It's possible...

297
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,048
|- | trust L.

298
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,385
I also think we need L's help
in this case.

299
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,387
Me too...

300
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,057
L said from the beginning that...

301
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,810
he needed the police's help
in this case.

302
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,271
Perhaps you could
think of it like this.

303
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,691
L was waiting
for this to happen.

304
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,902
For what to happen?

305
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,904
There were people
in the investigation

306
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,782
who distrusted L
from the beginning.

307
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,202
Then we had detectives
continuously resign...

308
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,247
and confidential information
was leaked.

309
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,541
You can't run an investigation
unless you trust your partners.

310
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,919
In other words, L was waiting
for the task force

311
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,381
to get down to the people he can trust

312
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,966
and who will face evil
without fear.

313
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,551
Yes.

314
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,181
I'll resign rather than
join up with L.

315
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,642
Don't worry.

316
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,687
I won't trail you and
try to find L.

317
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,318
I trust L and will try
to cooperate with him.

318
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,611
Me too...

319
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,494
<i>I am currently in a room
at the 719/70 Hotel.</i>

320
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,081
<i>I shall be switching hotels from
now on every few days.</i>

321
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>From now on, I want you to
think of these rooms as...</i>

322
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>the de facto HQ of
the investigation.</i>

323
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,214
<i>If you can agree to these terms...</i>

324
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,760
<i>I want you to split into two groups,
with a 30-minute interval between you,</i>

325
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>and come here by...
twelve o'clock midnight.</i>

326
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:33,566
<i>Kira, we're even in how far we've
closed the distance between us.</i>

327
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,943
<i>Fine.</i>

328
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>I'll show myself to others as L
for the ﬁrst time.</i>

329
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>If you manage to ﬁnd out
about this, you'll deﬁnitely move in closer.</i>

330
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,582
<i>Bring it on.</i>

331
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,503
<i>I did a lot these past few days.</i>

332
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,672
<i>Think.</i>

333
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,924
<i>Was there something that I missed?</i>

334
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,886
<i>And... what is my next move?</i>

335
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,516
<i>L, the real battle starts now.</i>

336
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,651
Please come in.

337
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,827
TO BE CONTINUED

338
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,249
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

339
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

340
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,175
I'm holding these feelings

341
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:46,639
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

342
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

343
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,608
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

344
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:03,322
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

345
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:07,117
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

346
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,788
<i>To accomplish</i>

347
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:21,590
