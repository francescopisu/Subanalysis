<i>The future that

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:48,465
<i>The ending</i>

<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,641
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

<i>World</i>

16
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,465
Matsuda! This isn't child's play.
Don't joke around.

17
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,675
Okay.. -

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,928
This is the Kira case!
Take it seriously!

19
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,054
Sorry.

20
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,932
Matsuda!
I mean, Mr. Matsuda, please stop.

21
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,100
Matsuda...?

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,935
I don't want to be dead weight.

23
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,021
Ryuzaki!

24
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,941
Is there anything I can do
besides being a manager?

25
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,068
Could you get me
another cup of coffee?

26
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,445
What?

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,285
I want to play a more active role!

00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,667

So please...

31
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,672
don't say you're going home.

32
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,259
Stay by my side, forever...

33
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,304
Oh! Mr. Director...

34
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,474
I have a boyfriend.
Can we cut the love scenes please?

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,017
Wait a second!

36
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,685
Where is this coming from?!

37
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,437
Can't we fake a kiss?

38
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,857
We can't make a movie like that!

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,108
If I say no, then it's no!

00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,660
<i>Yotsuba Group's Tokyo head ofﬁce...</i>

00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:48,210
<i>Deaths that are beneﬁcial to Yotsuba

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,639
<i>Matsuda is a natural at that.</i>

48
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,182

Hey, Matsu!

52
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,946
He went off somewhere.

53
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
Huh?!

54
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,510
So...

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,345
Please check this list.

56
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,930
Understood.

57
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,894
<i>Would I punish evil-doers
if I could kill</i>

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,605
<i>just by seeing
someone's face and name?</i>

59
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,818
<i>Indeed, there are people that
the world can do without...</i>

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,654
<i>But I don't think that
I would become a murderer: -.</i>

61
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,866
<i>just to change the world...</i>

62
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,869
<i>I'm thinking too hard about this.</i>

63
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>There's no way that anyone
could murder so many people...</i>

64
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,706
<i>- and not have any memories of doing so.
- What's wrong?</i>

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,917
You're staring at me...

66
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,255
You're angry that I'm
the only one eating cake, aren't you?

67
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,132
No, that's not it...

68
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,342
- Here.
- I wasn't envying you.

69
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>Ryuzaki.</i>

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,471
What is it, Watari?

71
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,768
<i>Detective Era/do Coil has been
asked to uncover L's identity.</i>

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,857
Isn't Eraldo Coil the man who's
the next greatest detective after L?

73
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,109
Who in the world would
send such a request?

74
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,489
<i>The person who requested it is the V.P.
of the rights and planning department</i>

75
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,990
<i>of Yotsuba Group's main ofﬁce,</i>

76
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,159
<i>Massahiko Kida.</i>

77
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,161
So it was Yotsuba!

78
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,705
Yotsuba is linked to Kira.

79
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,666
If they want L's identity,

80
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,085
then that means they
probably want to kill him.

81
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,087
That's not good.

82
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,217
We're already shorthanded,
and now we have to worry about Coil too?

83
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,889
It's all right. The detective known
as Eraldo Coil is me.

84
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:12,354
The three top detectives in the world,
L, Coil, and Deneuve...

85
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,022
are all me.

86
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,943
People who are trying to uncover me
usually fall for this.

87
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,031
I'll give you a strawberry,
so please keep it a secret.

88
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,159
As I expected of you, Ryuzaki.

89
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,718
<i>Maybe I should leave
while I have a chance.</i>

90
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,012
<i>No, then there would have been
no point in coming here.</i>

91
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,766
<i>Should I wait until everyone's gone
and search the ofﬁces?</i>

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,310
<i>No, if I were caught doing that...</i>

93
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>It's probably better if I leave...</i>

94
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,482
Not that again.

95
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,150
I'm exhausted...

96
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,611
At least it's before the weekend.

97
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,739
We don't know how long
these secret meetings last.

98
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,617
If these were on a Monday, I'd get
depressed about coming to the office.

99
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>Secret meetings? All right!</i>

100
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,339
<i>The nineteenth ﬂoor!</i>

101
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,176
<i>I've come this far!</i>

102
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,387
<i>I'm going to do this!</i>

103
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,725
Okay. I just have to get
close to him, right?

104
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Leave it to me.

105
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,856
I just have to make it possible to get
around the security cameras and systems

106
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,985
at the Yotsuba Tokyo main offices,
where this guy works, right?

107
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:47,657
Yes... It is safe to assume that
Kira and Yotsuba are connected.

108
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,076
We're going to check Yotsuba

109
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,414
to see who and how many
have the power.

110
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,416
It is important that we gain
a clear understanding quickly.

111
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,734
We must not allow Yotsuba to

112
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,945
figure out that we are
investigating them.

113
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,532
If someone notices, please assume that
we'll no longer be able to catch Kira.

114
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,745
<i>Damn it. I can't hear them clearly.</i>

115
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,415
<i>If I could only hear one thing,
something important...</i>

116
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,380
Rather, he's in the way.

117
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,048
Let's kill him and split up his stocks.

118
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,050
<i>I just heard them say, "kill"!</i>

119
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,220
Damn it, Kira sure is...

120
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,640
<i>Kira! There it is! Kira!
There it is! What?!</i>

121
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,559
<i>"Let's have Kira kill him"?
I heard it!</i>

122
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,603
<i>They're really working with Kira...</i>

123
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>I did it... I did a great job!</i>

124
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,783
Who are you?!

125
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,579
Please be sure not to act
out of panic or haste.

126
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,124
And don't take matters
into your own hands.

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>Ryuzaki...</i>

128
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,669
What is it, Watari?

129
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,589
<i>Matsuda has sent
an emergency signal from his belt...</i>

130
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,717
From where?

131
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,638
Well, it seems it's coming from within
Yotsuba Tokyo's main offices.

132
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,561
My name is Taro Matsui.
An agent with Yoshida Productions!

133
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,106
How would you like to use
our top multi-talented star, Misa Amane,

134
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,694
as the new spokeswoman for
your company and for your commercials?!

135
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,239
Forget about everything I just said.

136
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,825
We'll need to rethink our strategy.

137
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,537
Matsuda, you idiot!

138
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,844
Yoshida Productions...

139
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,304
Taro Matsui...

140
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,141
He doesn't have anything
suspicious on him.

141
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,852
And he doesn't seem to
be a corporate spy.

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,396
Yes, well, please...

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,232
Please take Misa-Misa
into consideration.

144
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,779
<i>These two are only lookouts...</i>

145
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,824
<i>The rest of them must be talking about
how to dispose of me.</i>

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,785
<i>Am I going to be killed?</i>

147
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,871
<i>I wonder if the emergency signal
was received...</i>

148
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,458
<i>Anyway, I wonder if
Ryuzaki will save me.</i>

149
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,169
<i>What's gonna happen to me?</i>

150
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,927
You can answer it.
Don't say that you're here.

151
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,598
Hold it away from your ear,
so we can hear.

152
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,433
Okay.. -

153
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,686
Hello?

154
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>Hey, Matsui!</i>

155
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,399
<i>Ryuzaki!</i>

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,279
<i>It's me... Asahi.
Been a while!</i>

157
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,532
Oh... Asahi, it's been a while.

158
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,077
You don't sound like you're out.
You home already?

159
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>Yeah...</i>

160
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,455
Are you by yourself?

161
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,542
Yeah... I'm by myself.
What's up?

162
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,878
Misa Amane is somewhere else.
Matsuda is alone.

163
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,382
Wanna go drinking?

164
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:37,137
<i>What? Now?
Sorry, I'm gonna have to pass...</i>

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,721
What the hell?

166
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,224
Don't tell me you're going through
money troubles again?

167
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,475
<i>"Troubles?"</i>

168
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,355
Yeah, my finances are totally
in trouble. That's obvious.

169
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,358
Matsuda's totally in trouble.

170
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,818
Oh well.

171
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>I'll ask you out again
some other time. Later...</i>

172
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,414
So what do you think
about Misa-Misa?

173
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,041
I think she'll be great
for your company.

174
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,714
If you're going to pitch someone,
shouldn't you bring them with you?

175
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,885
Are you really her manager?

176
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,805
Well, right now she's filming
a movie nearby.

177
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,391
I'll call her here once she's finished.

178
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,727
Please make her the spokeswoman
of your company!

179
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,438
<i>I better keep stalling...</i>

180
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,483
Misa's phone is on voice-mail.

181
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,737
I left her a message to call us.

182
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,072
What are we going to do, Ryuzaki?

183
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,450
Well...

184
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,538
If Matsuda dies, that would justify
the suspicion against Yotsuba.

185
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,168
Let's just watch the situation
for a while.

186
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,379
What shall we do?

187
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,757
The question is whether
he heard us or not.

188
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,302
There is a possibility.
We've got to kill him.

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,513
But did he really come to
pitch his client to us?

190
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,058
Could he be a police officer?

191
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,893
He can't be.

192
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,605
The Japanese police have completely
withdrawn from the Kira case.

193
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,274
It doesn't matter who he is.

194
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,777
We have to kill him.

195
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,369
It might be good to have her
as the face of our company.

196
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,541
Right? Her shoot will finish soon,
so please wait a moment.

197
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,464
I'm tired.

198
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,262
A message from Light!

199
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,186
Misa...

200
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,981
<i>Light... Sorry I've been
working so much.</i>

201
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,190
<i>I'll be ﬁnished soon.</i>

202
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,193
Misa, you're not
with Matsuda, are you?

203
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,947
He's horrible!
He just abandoned me here...

204
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,784
Oh, I'm getting a call
on my work phone.

205
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,995
It's from Matsu.

206
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,372
Misa got a call from Matsuda.

207
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,875
Tell Misa to let us listen in as well.

208
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,381
<i>Misa-Misa, when you're ﬁnished with the shoot,
come to Yotsuba's main Tokyo ofﬁces.</i>

209
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,343
You may be able to appear
in Yotsuba's commercials.

210
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,845
I'm negotiating with them right now.

211
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,181
What? Really?
That's amazing, Matsu!

212
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,850
So that's what you've been up to!

213
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,144
<i>I'll do my best!</i>

214
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,813
<i>Yeah. It's a short trip by taxi.</i>

215
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,445
Light, we may be able to
save Matsuda.

216
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:46,409
But we'll need Misa's help.
I'm sure she'll listen to you.

217
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,205
I'm Misa-Misa!

218
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,209
I don't do nudes,
but swimsuits and lingerie are okay!

219
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,587
Pleased to meet you!

220
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,968
She's really cute in person.

221
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,096
That's not the problem right now,
don't you think?

222
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,640
Matsu, since this is for Yotsuba,

223
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,435
I got the okay from the offices
to have a special reception.

224
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,354
Hm? Special?

225
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,106
Good evening!

226
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,525
Pleased to meet you!

227
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,072
We'll be entertaining you with
all the girls from the agency tonight!

228
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,575
Hey, don't you think this is
headed in a weird direction?

229
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,494
It can't be helped.

230
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,081
Right now, we can't leave
that manager alone.

231
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,958
Since we're here,
I'm just going to enjoy myself.

232
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,593
<i>Ryuzaki and the others
can see us from here.</i>

233
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,178
<i>I might be saved...</i>

234
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,933
Here! Please drink! Drink!

235
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,227
<i>This is heaven.</i>

236
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,980
Misa's pretty good at this.

237
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,155
Now then...

238
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,284
I'm going to the restroom.

239
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,587
Ryuzaki, are you watching?

240
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,005
Yes.

241
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,173
<i>Umm, sorry, I...</i>

242
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,050
Never mind that already.

243
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,385
<i>Yes.</i>

244
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,761
The eight who are here,
were having a meeting

245
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,222
to determine
who they would get Kira to kill.

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,768
I heard it clearly.
It's definitely them.

247
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,645
It's probably true.

248
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,400
But if you did overhear them,
then they should be trying to kill you.

249
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,944
I figured that...

250
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,321
Is there anything I can do?

251
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,867
<i>Luckily, you're still alive,
so we may be able to save you.</i>

252
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,452
<i>But for that to happen...</i>

253
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,996
You must die before they kill you.

254
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
What?

255
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,791
I want you to listen to me very closely.

256
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,009
You can't mean...

257
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,970
That's impossible!

258
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,890
Isn't that so?

259
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,099
In other words...

260
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,727
No, there are some exes
that I still think about.

261
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,062
Our company is still expanding.

262
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,904
What's going on?!

263
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>Man... I am so drunk.</i>

264
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,371
It feels good!

265
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,250
Hey, is everyone having fun?

266
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,587
That's no good.
You should be enjoying yourselves...

267
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,174
Now, everyone...
The thing you've been waiting for!

268
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,219
Showtime with Taro Matsui!

269
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,640
Hey, what are you doing?

270
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,477
Go, Mr. Matsui!

271
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,437
Alley oop...

272
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,568
Hey, you're drunk!
That's dangerous.

273
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,112
It's all right...

274
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,532
I always do this.

275
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,582
- Stop it! It's dangerous!
- You idiot!

276
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,668
It's all right...

277
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,397
He fell!

278
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,276
This is bad...

279
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,194
Oh no!

280
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,447
I heard a thud so I came out,
how horrible!

281
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,492
<i>- Call emergency! Call Emergency!
- Man, this role sucks...</i>

282
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,913
Everyone, leave this to us and go home.

283
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,206
What? But...

284
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,876
It's all right. But please consider me
for the commercial.

285
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,505
Hurry. It will be bad if
the press sees us here.

286
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
Yeah.

287
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,345
What's going on?!
Did someone jump?!

288
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,350
Well, it's good that we saw him
die right before our eyes.

289
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,185
Hey!

290
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,158
I know we're shorthanded,
but I don't like doing this.

291
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,202
Matsuda, you idiot.

292
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,846
Misa Amane's manager dies...

293
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,770
UNKNOWN NUMBER

294
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
Yes?

295
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,190
<i>You're Masahiko Kida, V. P. of
the Rights and Planning Department...</i>

296
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,568
<i>at the Yotsuba Group's main
Tokyo branch, aren't you?</i>

297
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,613
Yes, that's right.
Who are you?

298
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,785
My name is Eraldo Coil.
I'd like to discuss my terms with you.

299
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,374
A $2 million advance and
$8 million upon completion?

300
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,708
Are you out of your mind?

301
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,211
And even if we don't
commission him,

302
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,588
we have to pay him $2 million
to keep him silent.

303
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,882
Hush money, huh?

304
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,261
We should assume that
Coil knows quite a bit already.

305
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,767
That's pretty bad.
I want out of these meetings!

306
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,311
I don't know who Kira is,

307
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,231
but I don't want to get wrapped up
in this and get myself arrested!

308
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
Hatori...

309
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,571
You're going to be dead tomorrow.

310
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,706
Wait! I was just joking!

311
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,710
I'll do it.
I'll stay and do it!

312
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,294
So what are we going to do?

313
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,090
Coil is willing to accept our job
despite what he knows.

314
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,551
He'll become partners
with us as long as we pay him.

315
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,927
That's what it means.

316
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,140
We need to have someone
as skilled as Coil on our side.

317
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,850
That's right. Pay him.

318
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,268
It doesn't matter how much it'll cost.

319
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,603
That's right, pay him!

320
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,492
All right, we'll contract Coil.

321
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,161
Any objections?

322
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,454
No objections.

323
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,666
L, are you listening?

324
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,463
I'm so disappointed.
The security level here is horrible.

325
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,424
They only have a contract
with a security company.

326
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,760
There weren't even any
wiretap detectors.

327
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,930
It's been one week since I snuck in.

328
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,100
Things seem to be
moving very smoothly.

329
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,727
We're almost there.

330
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,480
One of them...

331
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,816
is Kira.

332
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,986
<i>Now then,
let's commence our regular meeting.</i>

333
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,323
There only appears to be
seven of them instead of eight.

334
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,826
TO BE CONTINUED

335
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:31,373
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

336
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:36,754
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

337
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,466
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

338
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:45,763
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

339
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:52,144
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

340
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:57,441
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

341
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,404
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

342
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

343
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,870
<i>To accomplish</i>

344
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,631
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

345
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,845
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

346
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:31,684
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

347
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,439
