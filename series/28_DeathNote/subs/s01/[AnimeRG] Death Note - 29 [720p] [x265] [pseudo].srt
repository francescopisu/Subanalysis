FATHER

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,011
Ryuk.

28
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,019
Sidoh, why are you here?

29
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,316
Hey, don't follow me!

30
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,403
I want my notebook back.

31
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,073
<i>Yeah... I ﬁgured it'd be that...</i>

32
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,116
Well... to be honest,

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,704
things have gotten complicated
so I don't know where it is now...

34
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,665
That's so irresponsible.

35
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,671
You're still following me?

36
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,798
Give me back my notebook!

37
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,299
I don't know where it is...

38
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,346
If you want it back, go look for it...

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,353
Wammy's House wasn't
simply an orphanage...

40
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,481
it was an institution for
brilliant children...

41
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:14,903
to raise them to become
the Second L... L's successor...

42
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,698
<i>'1 is successors... ”</i>

43
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,868
The one who ranked at the top
was a boy called Near.

44
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,121
<i>Near... N... Huh?</i>

45
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:30,585
And the boy N mentioned, Mello,
was ranked next after Near.

46
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,340
<i>Near is L's successor...
There's no mistake...</i>

47
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,884
<i>N is commanding the SPK...</i>

48
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,389
<i>No... Mello probably wanted to
become L's successor...</i>

49
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,766
<i>If that's the case,
Mello would probably</i>

50
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,103
<i>want to use any means necessary
to get the notebook before Near...</i>

51
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,397
<i>Near is convinced
that Mello is involved.</i>

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,109
<i>He's certain that he is...</i>

53
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,361
These are sketches
of both of them.

54
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,905
There are no photographs of them.

55
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,492
<i>L's successor...</i>

56
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,536
<i>I'm still...</i>

57
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,329
<i>ﬁghting L...</i>

58
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,168
<i>At any rate,
I have to ﬁgure out</i>

59
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,879
<i>where Mello and
his Maﬁa associates are located...</i>

60
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>I've already had Misa check
a list of wanted Maﬁa members</i>

61
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>with her Shinigami eyes...</i>

62
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,513
Oh! There he is! Someone
whose name I can't see!

63
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,559
Number 105! His name is listed
as Jack Neylon, but...

64
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,853
His real name is Kal Snyder!

65
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,938
<i>With the Death Note,</i>

66
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,776
<i>I made Snyder send a letter to
tell me where his hideout is...</i>

67
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,278
<i>It should be coming soon!</i>

68
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,575
Light! You've got a letter...

69
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,037
<i>He is in Los Angeles!</i>

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,665
<i>I did it! I've completely
surpassed both of them!</i>

71
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,045
<i>I'm deﬁnitely the strongest as long as
I have the Death Note and Misa's eyes!</i>

72
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,554
Light, I've been a big help, haven't I?

73
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,682
Yeah, I love you, Misa.

74
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:37,504
The only thing I have to do
is see how far I can control people.

75
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:43,134
<i>I'd like everyone to see me...
so I can talk to them.</i>

76
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,180
<i>The owner is Snyder...</i>

77
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>I guess I have to make him
touch the notebook...</i>

78
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,191
<i>Oh, well...
Wheee... plop.</i>

79
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,111
What the hell?
The notebook moved on its own...

80
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,656
It's a notebook that
can kill people.

81
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,741
I wouldn't be surprised
if it were alive!

82
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,372
B- Boss!
The guy with the dirty clothes...

83
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,832
Is he new?

84
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm not a new guy,
I'm a Shinigami...

85
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,670
Shinigami?

86
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,633
If you want others to see me,

87
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,177
you have to make them
touch the notebook.

88
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,891
He says you can see him
if you touch the notebook...

89
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,184
Everyone, touch it!

90
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,103
There's nothing wrong with me!

91
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,691
Fine... Everyone...

92
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,277
Touch the notebook.

93
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,821
- Woah!
- What's this?!

94
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,573
- I couldn't see him before.
- Boss! Shall I kill him?!

95
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,498
It's no use. Humans can't kill me.

96
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,254
Seems this Shinigami's real.

97
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,340
And it looks like
he's telling the truth.

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,346
Ryuk. Right now I'm going to
relinquish ownership of this notebook.

99
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,767
Follow the person
who I give it to.

100
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,811
What's this? You're relinquishing
your ownership?

101
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,315
Won't you lose your memory
if you do that?

102
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,150
Misa, lend me your notebook.

103
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:28,657
If I do this, I won't lose my memory
even if I relinquish my ownership.

104
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,951
I'll give you as many pages
as you need.

105
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,496
From now on, you shall be Kira.
Can you do that?

106
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,875
That's fine, but...
what are you going to do?

107
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,252
I'll explain that right now...

108
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,755
Mistakes will not be allowed.

109
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,470
Chocolate is... good...

110
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,348
Hey! So is what you just said true?!

111
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,309
"If the person using the note
fails to consecutively write

112
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,645
names of people to be killed
within 13 days of each other,

113
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,729
then the user will die. "

114
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,316
"if you make this note unusable
by tearing it up or burning it,

115
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,194
all the humans who have touched
the note till then will die. "

116
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,572
These two rules were made up?!

117
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,076
Yeah. Those are definitely fake.

118
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,872
A Shinigami probably wrote that
as a joke before giving it to a human.

119
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,503
<i>We can disprove the thirteen-day rule
by using a single person...</i>

120
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>The problem is whether this notebook had
passed through Kira's hands or not...</i>

121
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,636
<i>If it has, whether Kira know
these rules were fake or not...</i>

122
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>If Kira knows, then they could be
used to his advantage...</i>

123
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,605
<i>Especially the thirteen-day rule which
lets anyone prove they're innocent.</i>

124
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,152
Sidoh, keep guard outside.

125
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,531
You can't be seen by humans, so
at least you're useful for something...

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,366
Keep watch outside.

127
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,784
Got it?

128
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,870
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,290
<i>He's scaly for a human...</i>

130
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,006
This is Yagami.

131
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,758
<i>This is Kira.</i>

132
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,384
What did you say?

133
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,469
Kira?

134
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,847
<i>The notebook that the Japanese
task force had in its possession</i>

135
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,766
<i>was stolen by criminals, wasn't it?</i>

136
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,186
<i>Do you have any proof that
you're Kira?!</i>

137
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,440
<i>Proof? Now that the notebook
has been passed,</i>

138
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,861
<i>there's no way I can prove that
I'm Kira by predicting killings.</i>

139
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>But you'll receive proof that
I am Kira soon.</i>

140
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,620
<i>It's my notebook.</i>

141
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,497
What is the meaning of this?

142
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,709
<i>The notebook I'm giving you
allows me to know a person's name</i>

143
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>by seeing their face...</i>

144
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,047
<i>Got that?</i>

145
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,924
Calm down...

146
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,301
and... listen to... me...

147
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,889
<i>On November 10, at 23:59,</i>

148
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,685
<i>E very maﬁa member that I have
gathered information on</i>

149
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>from the FBI and
other organizations will die.</i>

150
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,529
<i>I've already written it in my notebook,
so it cannot be changed.</i>

151
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,990
<i>I also know where their hideout is.</i>

152
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>I shall send that information
along with the notebook...</i>

153
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,495
<i>In other words...</i>

154
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>On November 10, at 23:59...</i>

155
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:30,171
<i>This moment is your best chance...
to get the notebook back.</i>

156
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,232
What should we do?

157
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,735
If the members of the mafia are going
to die on the day that Kira specified,

158
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,404
there would be an opportunity.

159
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,991
I resent the idea of following
Kira's plan, but it's a good plan.

160
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,659
That's right.

161
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,999
But it doesn't...

162
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,961
do us any good just by knowing
when the mafia are doing to die.

163
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,506
Mr. Ide, you know the answer.

164
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,009
We'll have the Shinigami follow us...

165
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,972
W- We do the eye deal and
kill them for sure...

166
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,516
I'll do the deal.

167
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,353
N- No way! I'll do the deal...

168
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,065
I handed over the notebook
to begin with.

169
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,695
Because of that,
I even thought of killing myself...

170
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,157
I'll use the notebook
to kill the criminals...

171
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,828
And after thirteen days,
I'll die too...

172
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,041
<i>If Dad ever writes a name
in the notebook...</i>

173
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,959
<i>When that happens...</i>

174
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,925
NOVEMBER 10, 23:47

175
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,264
Is everyone ready?

176
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,766
<i>We're ready.</i>

177
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,477
Then... Deputy Director Yagami...

178
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,564
It's time to make the eye deal
with the Shinigami...

179
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,736
Ryuk, please.

180
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,155
I understand...

181
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,126
Deputy Director Yagami,

182
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,671
take a look at the photographs
of the criminals I gave you.

183
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,756
<i>Can you see their names
and life-spans?</i>

184
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah... | can...

185
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,720
Your signal to go is when
their names disappear.

186
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,287
We're going in!

187
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,011
<i>I knew it, Kira was involved...</i>

188
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,680
<i>I never thought he'd go this far...</i>

189
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,765
<i>My perfect plan isn't ready...</i>

190
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,727
<i>Damn! What is Sidoh doing?</i>

191
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,314
Just be quiet and watch, Sidoh!

192
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,484
You'll get your notebook
as long as you don't interfere.

193
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,449
Roy! Skyer!

194
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,576
The notebook is under Rod!

195
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,703
Bring it up to the monitor room!

196
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,882
Don't move!

197
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,392
L, we've captured two of them.

198
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,977
We've also safely retrieved
the notebook!

199
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,355
<i>We're going back now!</i>

200
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,982
No, not yet.

201
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>We still haven't found anyone
who resembles Mello.</i>

202
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,115
<i>He's hiding somewhere
in the building.</i>

203
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,536
We've come this far. Use caution,
and hunt him down.

204
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,429
- What's was that?
- An explosion?

205
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,099
Don't move.

206
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,227
I've just blown up
the two entrances.

207
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,604
But that was only a warning.

208
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,315
Next, I'll blow up
the entire building...

209
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>Do what I say...</i>

210
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>It's Mello!</i>

211
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,455
Yagami again, huh?
Maybe I should have killed you?

212
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,919
I never thought I would be bargaining
for the notebook with you again.

213
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:30,138
M- I-H-A-E-L - K-E-E-H-L...

214
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,308
Your real name is... Mihael Keehl.

215
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,602
<i>Damn if! How did he-.7</i>

216
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,563
<i>I did it!</i>

217
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,023
Give up, Mello.

218
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,694
I won't kill you if you surrender.

219
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,447
<i>What? Why are you being stupid?</i>

220
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,574
<i>Hurry! Write his name
in the notebook and kill him!</i>

221
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,787
You'll die if I write your name
in this notebook.

222
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,249
Throw down the detonator
and raise your hands!

223
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,342
- Yagami...
- Don't move!

224
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,803
I only have to write your last name!

225
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,346
It won't take a second.

226
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,558
<i>You idiot... Just write it. Write it!</i>

227
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,938
Sorry... I really didn't
want to kill you...

228
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,071
Yagami, you've...

229
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,824
never killed anyone before,
have you?

230
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,165
Gun shots?!

231
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,174
Deputy Director!

232
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,051
Jose! Grab the notebook!

233
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,261
Damn... This guy...

234
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,679
He won't let go of the notebook!

235
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,681
Why... you!

236
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,155
Deputy Director!

237
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,034
This is it, Mello!

238
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,702
Hands in the air now!

239
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,393
<i>Matsuda, are you okay?</i>

240
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,019
<i>I don't think so...</i>

241
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,479
<i>He's okay...</i>

242
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,024
<i>L, I don't see any sign of Mello!</i>

243
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,235
<i>W- What?</i>

244
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,863
<i>Damn it. He got away?!</i>

245
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,408
<i>That's why I told my him
to kill him quickly...</i>

246
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:11,048
Dad, Dad! Please, don't die!

247
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,885
Light...

248
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,304
Dad!

249
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,518
I'm so glad...

250
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,189
Yeah, I'm glad too, Dad.

251
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,734
Light...

252
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,823
I still have the Shinigami eyes.

253
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:43,039
According to that Shinigami, Ryuk,

254
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,460
I can't see the lifespans of those
who own the notebook...

255
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,712
Light...

256
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,299
You're not Kira...

257
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,346
I'm really... glad...

258
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,142
Of course.
You were still worried about that?

259
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,479
Dad, don't say anything unnecessary.

260
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,566
<i>That's important, but there's something
even more important right now.</i>

261
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,735
<i>He has to write Mello's name
in the notebook...</i>

262
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,530
S- Sorry...

263
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:23,162
In the end, |... | couldn't kill him...

264
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>It might not be good to say that
"it's not too late, " here...</i>

265
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,918
<i>No, it depends on how I do it...</i>

266
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,755
<i>At a time like this... I can be
distraught to a certain extent...</i>

267
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,926
Dad! Write his name!

268
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,887
Write his name with
the last of your strength!

269
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,139
You can't just let him beat you!

270
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,228
Dad!

271
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,481
Light...

272
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,747
I'm sorry...

273
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,791
Dad!

274
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,209
Dad!

275
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,669
Dad!

276
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,381
Don't you die! You idiot!

277
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,496
You're the Shinigami who came to
take back this notebook, right?

278
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,123
Yes.

279
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,209
Even if it benefits
the Kira investigation,

280
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,211
we only need one
of these notebooks...

281
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,589
I'll give it back to you.

282
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,810
<i>Those who use the notebook
are cursed with misfortune, huh?</i>

283
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,481
<i>Well, it's not as if Soichiro
actually used the notebook.</i>

284
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,567
<i>He died believing that
his son isn't Kira.</i>

285
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>So I guess he was happy...</i>

286

If Kira rules the world,
he is justice.

From now, the world will
gradually lean in favor of Kira.

305

Kira will become justice.
