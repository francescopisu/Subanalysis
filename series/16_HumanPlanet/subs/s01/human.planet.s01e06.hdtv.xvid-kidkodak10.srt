1
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:10,129
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

2
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,931
That creature is us.

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:22,934
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

4
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:28,051
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

5
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:32,732
This is the Human Planet.

6
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:48,414
Grass is a remarkable plant.

7
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:52,450
It supports a great abundance of life.

8
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:57,127
Wheat, rice, barley and corn,

9
00:00:57,177 --> 00:01:00,533
they're all grasses and they feed us.

10
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:07,216
And the grasslands feed the animals
that feed our world too.

11
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:14,250
Our lives on the grasslands have
transformed the planet,

12
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:16,333
from the prairies of America

13
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,335
to the rice terraces of China.

14
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,014
But it's not been easy.

15
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:27,970
It's taken every last ounce of
human courage and ingenuity

16
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:31,930
to become masters of the grasslands.

17
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:13,089
Dawn on the savannah
in southern Kenya.

18
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:19,848
It's the moment Rakita and his mates
have been waiting for.

19
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:25,815
The wildebeest migration has arrived.

20
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:33,532
Here, lush grasses support the largest
herds of animals in the world.

21
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:37,490
A bounty of opportunity
for these Dorobo hunters.

22
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:44,370
But there's fierce competition
for all this meat on the hoof

23
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:48,808
from some of the world's
most efficient killers.

24
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,326
So how do mere humans,
without fangs or claws,

25
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:25,689
who can't outrun a wildebeest,
get a meal around here?

26
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:32,212
Rakita uses brains and teamwork.

27
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:40,013
His plan is to let the lions
kill the wildebeest,

28
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:44,255
then he'll steal their dinner
from right under their noses.

29
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,735
His two friends are essential.

30
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:53,053
Lions aren't easily intimidated.

31
00:03:56,497 --> 00:04:01,252
First, Rakita must find the tracks
of a lion pride on the hunt.

32
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:04,972
(WHISPERING)

33
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,735
At 65, he's a veteran hunter
and takes the lead.

34
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:18,372
They must watch their backs -
this is man-eater territory.

35
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:22,729
(THEY WHISPER)

36
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:44,606
All the signs point to
a fresh kill nearby.

37
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:11,576
Rakita's been attacked by lions before.
He knows this could end badly.

38
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:44,853
They're up against 1 5 hungry lions,
but, if they act as one,

39
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:49,607
they might just intimidate the lions
and push them off their kill.

40
00:05:56,577 --> 00:06:01,810
They make their move.
Self-confidence is everything.

41
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:11,056
This is the ultimate face-off.

42
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:22,254
Suddenly, the lions back off.

43
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:40,853
Rakita has just minutes before
the lions realise it's a bluff.

44
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:58,449
In a matter of seconds, he butchers
the haunch of the wildebeest,

45
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,567
and they beat a hasty retreat.

46
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:29,416
This is a scene which has played out
throughout human existence,

47
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:34,451
hunters using brains, not brawn,
to outwit their mighty competitors.

48
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:23,690
Getting another animal
to do the killing for you is clever,

49
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,935
but making the kill yourself is
an even bigger challenge.

50
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,136
At the other end of Africa, on the edge
of the Kalahari Desert,

51
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:41,730
lies a much drier grassland,
supporting far fewer animals.

52
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:44,974
There's no free lunch here.

53
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,852
!Kun and N/ /ao are
Ju/'hoansi bushmen.

54
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,969
!Kun is a master hunter,

55
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:59,330
one of a handful of Ju/'hoansi who
still have the skills to hunt big game.

56
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:04,815
So !Kun is teaching his apprentice
to keep this precious knowledge alive.

57
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,777
The hunt begins by kindling fire.

58
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:31,485
They burn the grass from around the
only waterhole for many kilometres.

59
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:38,091
They know the animals will
ultimately come to drink here

60
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:42,130
and when they do,
they'll have nowhere to hide.

61
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:50,895
Their bows and dart arrows are
too small to kill outright,

62
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,895
so they refine their weapons.

63
00:09:55,337 --> 00:10:00,775
!Kun, the master, knows exactly
where to find poison.

64
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:07,849
Within this hardened sand shell
is a beetle grub.

65
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:13,972
Ifjust one drop of beetle juice gets
into the tiniest cut, it will kill him.

66
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:17,646
He anoints his arrows with great care.

67
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:27,526
But their prey are wily too,
so they build a grass hide.

68
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:30,250
This is an ambush.

69
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:37,809
!Kun wants his apprentice to get
his first kudu.

70
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:44,853
(WHISPERS)

71
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:52,655
The antelope's acute hearing
and sharp eyes

72
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:56,610
mean he must learn to move silently
and without being seen.

73
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:03,087
But N/ /ao has been spotted.

74
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:08,295
The moment is lost.

75
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:09,929
(WHISPERS)

76
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:27,655
Two days later, the bushmen are
still in their hide,

77
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:31,133
hoping that the kudus'thirst
will overcome their fear.

78
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,129
But they stay away.

79
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:41,091
Then even the master
is caught unprepared.

80
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,528
It's a leopard.

81
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:48,490
Suddenly the hunters risk
becoming the hunted.

82
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:58,087
A leopard's jaws have the power
to crush a human skull.

83
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:27,014
They're praying
the leopard hasn't seen them.

84
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:30,732
N/ /ao lies low in the shadows.

85
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:43,331
This time they've managed
to remain undetected.

86
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:55,250
It's day six in the hide

87
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,767
and the apprentice is no closer
to getting a meal.

88
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,853
A new group of kudu come in.

89
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:09,896
They've got one chance.

90
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:14,095
Both men raise their bows.

91
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:20,329
Bull's-eye! An arrow has hit home
and the kudu scatter.

92
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,855
The injured kudu will run
for many kilometres

93
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:42,448
with the poison arrow in its flank,
as the toxins slowly take effect.

94
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,412
The pursuit begins.

95
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,537
First, they must find the arrow shaft.

96
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:55,014
It will show them which tracks to follow
and also who made the hit.

97
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,887
From here on, it's all about tracking.

98
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:23,207
The ground is criss-crossed
with hoof prints.

99
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:26,852
The wrong decision will mean
a wild-goose chase.

100
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:58,611
While tracking,

101
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:02,696
the hunters look at the landscape
through the eyes of their prey.

102
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:19,167
After ten hours, they finally catch up
with the kudu.

103
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:33,416
The poison has weakened it.
She's exhausted, near death.

104
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:42,972
N/ /ao aims a spear to the heart
to deliver a swift end.

105
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:14,051
After seven days,
N/ /ao has finally killed his first kudu.

106
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:21,130
Now there is one more person
in the world who can do this.

107
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:24,931
The meat they'll carry home will feed
their whole village.

108
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:28,367
And every part of the animal
will be put to use.

109
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:38,050
This burnt landscape looks dead,
but grass is incredibly resilient.

110
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:42,134
With the first drops of rain,
it regenerates.

111
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,731
And where these rains become floods,

112
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:51,690
grass grows to keep pace
with the rising waters.

113
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,251
Around the world,

114
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:59,528
many grasslands undergo
such extreme seasonal changes,

115
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,932
bringing new opportunities,

116
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,969
but also lurking dangers.

117
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:15,168
In Cambodia, the grasslands around
Tonle Sap lake are flooding...

118
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:20,734
...and for a few short weeks
there are rich pickings to be had.

119
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:26,295
It's Vaana's big chance
to make a killing.

120
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:34,526
He's here to hunt an unexpected,
hidden and potentially fatal wild prey.

121
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:02,494
Vaana's hunting skill lies
in recognising

122
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:07,657
the difference between an easy meal
and a deadly catch.

123
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,933
But it's not fish he's after.

124
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,775
It's snakes!

125
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:27,976
There are many millions of them
in this flooded grassland.

126
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:32,613
Most are edible water snakes
but some are venomous.

127
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:38,135
If he pulls up a cobra,
its bite could kill him.

128
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:42,372
It's a game of Russian roulette.

129
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:51,370
Even his five-year-old son
has to be a snake expert.

130
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:55,854
Knowing which is which
means survival here.

131
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,693
The snakes gather
in these huge numbers

132
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:03,650
to hunt the fish which spawn
in the submerged grass.

133
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,295
It's no time to be squeamish.

134
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:21,457
Every escapee sees Vaana's profits
slither away.

135
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,971
Vaana's whole family must
get to grips with snakes.

136
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:46,647
For the kids,
they are welcome new toys.

137
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:28,655
Vaana's catch is destined for
the biggest snake market in the world.

138
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:33,691
Over 6 million snakes change hands
in a matter of weeks.

139
00:20:57,097 --> 00:21:00,089
His payment for
a week's snake wrangling...

140
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:03,174
60p.

141
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:21,326
But survival in the grasslands
isn't all about hunting.

142
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:30,569
In East Africa, the Masai have learnt
how to collaborate with a wild bird

143
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:35,054
to get a sweet treat they can only get
if they work together.

144
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,607
(WHISTLING)

145
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:44,091
Leitato is whistling to attract
a honey guide.

146
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,850
It's a bird that is aptly named.

147
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:56,970
The honey guide answers
their whistles

148
00:21:57,017 --> 00:22:01,010
with a call it only uses
to talk to humans.

149
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:16,852
She starts a game of
Follow My Leader...

150
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:24,976
...since only she can smell
the food they're after.

151
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:34,449
When she's close to the prize,
she changes her call,

152
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,614
letting them know
they're getting hotter.

153
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:55,927
The boys have hit the jackpot -
a beehive. The bird's job is done.

154
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:14,371
Now they have to fulfil their part of
the bargain -getting the honey out.

155
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:24,250
It's hidden deep in the tree protected
by hundreds of angry African bees.

156
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:32,135
They use smoke to calm them.

157
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:40,290
But it doesn't make the stings
any less painful.

158
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:57,535
The boys know they have to pay
their guide.

159
00:23:57,577 --> 00:24:01,536
Honeycomb with added grubs.

160
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:20,253
It's the perfect partnership,
but, as every Masai boy knows,

161
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,936
if you don't give the honey guide
its reward,

162
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:26,333
next time it will lead you
to a lion's den!

163
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:36,329
So we've learnt how to find food
in the wild grasslands,

164
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:40,052
either on our own,
or with a bit of help from others.

165
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:46,049
But our mastery of the grasslands
took a huge leap forward

166
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:49,851
when we learnt how to exploit
the grass itself.

167
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:57,337
Wheat, maize and rice all started life
as wild grasses,

168
00:24:57,377 --> 00:25:00,096
which we've bred into crops.

169
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:09,134
This has enabled us to feed
millions of people every year,

170
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:13,853
and so we've settled down
and built homes beside our fields.

171
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,373
But this man-made abundance
is irresistible

172
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,090
to many animals we now call pests.

173
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:36,090
On the African plains these cereal killers
come in plague proportions.

174
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,929
Isiah lives in Tanzania.

175
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:50,530
His rice harvest is just days away, but
he knows an aerial attack is imminent.

176
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:04,846
He must be vigilant, ever alert
to the sound he dreads.

177
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,533
The noise comes first...

178
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,169
(BIRDS TWEETING)

179
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,888
...then the advance party...

180
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:25,166
...followed by the swarm.

181
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:29,249
They are quelea.

182
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:34,166
They come in their millions
and people call them locust birds.

183
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,774
They are the most numerous
bird species on Earth,

184
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:53,535
ravenous for grain.

185
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,048
(IMITATES BIRD CALL)

186
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:07,217
Isiah and his neighbours must try
to prevent the quelea from settling,

187
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:11,216
otherwise the flock will strip
their crop in an hour.

188
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:20,605
It's not a battle he can win,
it's about limiting his losses.

189
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:31,176
As the seeds ripen, these migrant flocks
never stand still.

190
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:34,653
But they do have an Achilles heel.

191
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:37,973
In order to breed,
the quelea must stop,

192
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:41,896
weaving thousands of nests
in tight colonies.

193
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:47,531
This is the farmers'chance
to strike back.

194
00:27:55,817 --> 00:28:01,175
While most of the flock is away feeding,
a deadly trap is laid.

195
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:18,449
The birds return as dusk falls.

196
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:59,530
So far, we're one step ahead
in the arms race with the pests.

197
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:03,614
And our ability to manipulate
the grasslands

198
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:06,046
has gone from strength
to strength.

199
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:12,452
We have supersized
these man-made grasslands...

200
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:17,056
...sculpting mountains, felling forests

201
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:20,328
and redesigning the very surface
of our planet.

202
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:28,212
Seven grasses feed
almost seven billion people.

203
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:33,013
They supply three-quarters
of our carbohydrates,

204
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:36,367
bread and pasta,
noodles and porridge.

205
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:47,489
These artificial great plains are
making wild grasslands

206
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,893
amongst the most endangered
habitats on Earth.

207
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:59,612
Yet it was on the wild grasslands,
which support vast grazing herds,

208
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:03,047
that we achieved perhaps
our greatest triumph...

209
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:06,772
to subjugate these animals
to our needs.

210
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:11,011
Controlling a plant is one thing,

211
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:14,333
but dominating a creature
with its own free will

212
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:17,767
requires a far higher level
of manipulation.

213
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:25,409
The Mongolian steppe is
the biggest grassland on Earth.

214
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:31,736
There are more horses running wild here
than anywhere else in the world.

215
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:38,737
The Mongols'ability to tame horses

216
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:42,486
has made these nomads
masters of the steppe.

217
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:46,610
and, in a family of horsemen,
Ulaana is the best.

218
00:30:51,497 --> 00:30:53,806
He's got riding in his blood.

219
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:58,214
His ancestor Genghis Khan used
horse power to build an empire

220
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:03,092
but today, Ulaana's family face
a different challenge.

221
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:14,246
They must use their horses'speed
and stamina to capture wild mares.

222
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:25,695
Driving the wild herd back to the ger
camp is only the beginning of a day

223
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:29,696
that will test Ulaana's agility
and strength to the limit.

224
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:41,175
Ultimately he's after the mare's milk,
but it's not that straightforward.

225
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,253
These wild mares don't give up
their milk easily.

226
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:57,527
They have to be tricked into it.

227
00:31:57,577 --> 00:32:01,729
His success will depend on
total partnership with his horse.

228
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:25,846
First, Ulaana lassoes the foals,
so the mares will stay close.

229
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:29,253
But even the foals are feisty.

230
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:37,056
Ulaana leans behind his horse,

231
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:41,170
using its strength and weight
to resist the pull of the foal.

232
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:51,691
He must balance at a gallop,
using only his knees.

233
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:06,695
Once he's caught a foal,

234
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:11,447
his cousin Tungaa must get
a halter on before it escapes.

235
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,411
It is the first time they have felt
the touch of a human hand.

236
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:23,486
Once they're tethered,
Ulaana can move on to the mares.

237
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:30,775
This is the real battle -
mares are five times his weight.

238
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:59,773
With Ulaana at full stretch,
everyone lends a hand.

239
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:38,769
After two exhausting hours,
the men begin to get the upper hand.

240
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,575
Haltered and hobbled,
this mare is finally subdued.

241
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:59,247
Then they're left to calm down
with their foals.

242
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:05,652
Only with the foal suckling
will the mare let down her milk

243
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:10,487
and then Tungaa has a brief chance
to draw some off for the family.

244
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:22,093
But Mongolians prefer their milk
with a twist.

245
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:29,808
Their innovation has been to ferment
this sugary milk into airag,

246
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,576
a slightly alcoholic yoghurt.

247
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:43,410
The yoghurt bacteria turns the milk

248
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,255
into their most nutritious
summer food.

249
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,653
Without harming their animals,

250
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:28,212
Ulaana's family can live off them
year after year,

251
00:36:28,257 --> 00:36:30,452
turning the goodness of grass
into yoghurt

252
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:36,208
but, having bound their lives to
the grazing herds, they are nomads,

253
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:40,808
following the herds on their perpetual
search for fresh pastures.

254
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:21,614
In other cultures, we have taken
this mastery a step further,

255
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,217
taming and breeding the wild herds,

256
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:27,454
making them docile
and easy to handle.

257
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:32,650
In the African savannah,
herders keep their cattle close.

258
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:34,335
They are owned now

259
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:39,929
and, like property owners everywhere,
men will fight to protect them.

260
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:45,174
In the grasslands of
southern Ethiopia,

261
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:48,493
the Suri take this protection
to extremes.

262
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:54,689
Here, rival tribes even fight battles
over cattle.

263
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:58,616
So Suri herders must become warriors.

264
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:08,136
Shahuri will stop at nothing
to defend his herd.

265
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:29,216
For the Suri, cattle are currency.

266
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:33,011
Too valuable to kill,
they care for them intimately.

267
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:44,776
Every year Shahuri must undergo
a ritual trial of courage

268
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:48,776
to prove he's got what it takes
to be a cattle warrior.

269
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:56,250
He gets strength for the combat ahead
directly from his cows

270
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,253
by drinking their blood.

271
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:01,733
It may look brutal,
but it doesn't kill them.

272
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:10,533
This rich blood gives Shahuri
essential protein and iron,

273
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:13,694
and his prize animal will
recover quickly.

274
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:25,966
The vicious ritual of donga

275
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:30,454
will make or break Shahuri's
reputation as a cowboy.

276
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:34,728
It's the day ofjudgment.

277
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:39,771
The rival Suri clans arrive,
psyched up and ready for donga.

278
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,808
(SINGING)

279
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:50,096
It lasts a day.

280
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,049
You pick an opponent
from the neighbouring village for a duel.

281
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:57,568
The more victories you win,
the greater your courage.

282
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:04,693
Shahuri walks to the ring.

283
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:08,935
Even taking part in this ritual
takes serious guts.

284
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:14,495
He has no armour.
His only defence is a lucky sunhat.

285
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:22,847
Shahuri watches and waits.

286
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:47,815
The donga sticks are two metres long.
They can cause serious injury.

287
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:52,214
To win, you must thrash
your opponent until surrender.

288
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:06,447
Finally, Shahuri is ready for battle.

289
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:30,934
It's a victory, but not emphatic.
To prove himself, he fights again.

290
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:43,607
Suddenly his opponent backs down.
Shahuri is the champion.

291
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:58,209
Lifted high, his clan celebrate
his victory.

292
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:10,895
His cattle have their protector.

293
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:15,613
Shahuri has proved he can be
a cowboy, Ethiopian style.

294
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:28,249
But in the Australian outback,
they've reinvented the cowboy big time.

295
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:34,133
Here, supersized ranches across
the country hold 30 million cattle.

296
00:42:35,257 --> 00:42:38,647
This is the total mastery
of man over beast,

297
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:41,894
our ultimate ingenuity
in the grasslands.

298
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:50,415
Round-up used to take a month.
Not any more.

299
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,694
Ben Tapp is a muster pilot,

300
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:11,414
and he must bring in 2,000 of his
best cattle in just five days to get paid.

301
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:15,657
He'll need all his flying skills,

302
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:21,135
his ability to read the cattle,
and his mate Rankin, if he's to succeed.

303
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:23,896
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

304
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:31,013
BEN: If you can understand the cattle,

305
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:34,129
you can already anticipate
what they're going to do.

306
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:35,576
Like a good cattleman,

307
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:40,566
you can identify every single beast,
and every single beast is different.

308
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,415
His cattle are out there somewhere.

309
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:47,291
Scouting by air allows Ben
to home in on them fast.

310
00:43:52,657 --> 00:43:57,333
It appears there's about
six or seven of them along the line.

311
00:43:57,377 --> 00:43:59,811
When they find a group of cows,

312
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:04,055
they drop down to the ''death zone''
to flush them out.

313
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:06,531
Clipping any tree will be fatal.

314
00:44:12,537 --> 00:44:16,166
Don't put too much pressure on them.
They're fairly hot now.

315
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:19,448
Just stick with that mob there.
Keep them going that way.

316
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:25,085
You stick with them.
Oh, here's this mob here.

317
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:29,295
There are always some
trouble-makers.

318
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:58,449
We've got another...probably 1 50
coming in.

319
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:05,049
The choppers work together,
pushing the growing herd,

320
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:08,851
but they've got 50 kilometres
and billabongs to cross

321
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:11,365
before they get to the ranch.

322
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:20,812
Ben's cattle really don't
like swimming.

323
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,016
Anywhere here, where they're
ready to cross, we'll just let them go.

324
00:45:34,377 --> 00:45:37,255
Oh, look out, look out!

325
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:42,690
Every year, about ten muster pilots
crash and burn.

326
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:46,852
Just steady up there.

327
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:50,970
- They just work along where we sort of...
- Yeah.

From eight kilometres out,
the ground crew joins the drive.

I think we'll target
a little bit southward.

Come around. Everyone's here, right?

331
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:03,529

Hurry up!
They're going to go that way!

00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:25,246
Keep them going
the way they are heading there now.

(BEN CHUCKLES)

337
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:42,413
Now, we don't need to wait for
the wildebeest migration,

338
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,687
we create our own.

339
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:53,169
Grasslands have allowed us
to dominate the planet.

340
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:57,335
They are the landscape of
phenomenal human achievement.

341
00:46:59,177 --> 00:47:03,568
They underpin our present
global existence.

342
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:09,772
These cattle, native to India,
raised in Australia,

343
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:14,572
will soon be shipped out to feed
the international appetite for beef.

344
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,733
And over the season...

345
00:47:16,777 --> 00:47:19,814
they'll make Ben a millionaire.

346
00:47:19,857 --> 00:47:23,645
- Are you making much out of it?
- Yeah.

347
00:47:23,697 --> 00:47:26,336
About 1 .3 million bucks.

348
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,368
That's worth getting out of bed for!

349
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,534
- Yeah.

350
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:39,613
Our ingenuity and teamwork,
intelligence and courage

351
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:43,047
have all been refined
in the grasslands.

352
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:50,326
And this uniquely human
combination of skills

353
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:53,175
has enabled us to conquer the world.

354
00:47:58,617 --> 00:48:00,528
Without the grasslands,

355
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,809
planet Earth would never have
become the Human Planet.

356
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:17,929
Trying to steal food from the jaws
of the most powerful predator in Africa

357
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,774
may seem to us like lunacy,

358
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:23,492
but this extraordinary
and dangerous feat

359
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:26,734
has been practised in Kenya
for thousands of years.

360
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:36,775
But it has never been filmed before,
and may never be filmed again.

361
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:47,972
The Dorobo are an ancient tribe
who live in the grasslands of East Africa.

362
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:52,329
Conservation laws now stop
many of their traditional practices

363
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:55,016
and so threaten their whole way of life.

364
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:04,008
To record this unique sequence,
the Grasslands team needed a man

365
00:49:04,057 --> 00:49:08,573
who understands both lions
and the Dorobo people who live here.

366
00:49:09,857 --> 00:49:12,576
Jackson Looseyia, the crew's guide,

367
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,370
has a deep understanding
of this way of life,

368
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:19,012
having grown up nearby
in the Masai Mara.

369
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:24,576
When I was asked by the BBC
if they are able to document this story,

370
00:49:24,617 --> 00:49:28,405
I said, yeah, because it's something
that I've practised myself.

371
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:32,973
I've chased lions from food when
I was growing up. I knew this lifestyle.

372
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,006
It's possible,

373
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:40,087
it's just a matter of if the BBC are able
to capture this before it is gone.

374
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:46,495
It won't be easy,
as the lions here aren't used to cars,

375
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:48,846
so they're difficult to approach.

376
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:53,209
They mainly hunt at night when it's
too dangerous to get close on foot.

377
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:59,814
So the challenge is
to find a lion kill at dawn,

378
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,370
to enable the Dorobo

379
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:06,172
and big cat cameraman Warren Samuels
to do theirjobs.

380
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:08,572
We've got to wait for the lion
to make the kill

381
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:11,734
and it's got to be at a time when
we can still come out early morning

382
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:14,814
and still have enough light
to film them on the kill.

383
00:50:14,857 --> 00:50:18,611
We're hoping for a lot of luck.

384
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:22,217
At first light,Jackson joins the Dorobo,

385
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:24,817
in the hope of tracking down
a fresh lion kill.

386
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:28,213
You can see this is a footprint of
a lion, a very big lion,

387
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:32,535
and you can see there's a footprint
of a wildebeest.

388
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:36,047
Look here, you see,
this is a very, very big pride,

389
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:38,691
looking at the number of footprints,

390
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:42,207
and the number of places
that they like to drink.

391
00:50:43,337 --> 00:50:46,090
Because lions often hunt
just before dawn,

392
00:50:46,137 --> 00:50:49,254
the team have to follow them
both day and night.

(QUIETLY) In Africa,
night is everything.

395
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:59,413
It's terrifying, it's scary.
But it's so much alive.

396
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:10,256
Do you see them? There are the lions,
we've found them, listen.

397
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:16,054
Sharing the night shift with Jackson is
Human Planet researcher,Jane Atkins.

398
00:51:16,097 --> 00:51:19,214
JANE: We just came across lionesses
with their eight cubs

399
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:21,452
quite local to where
the Dorobo guys live.

400
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:25,649
But the down side of that is that when
the Dorobo do come across a kill,

401
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:28,052
if it's in this area with this pride,

402
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:32,693
these lionesses are going to be
a lot more aggressive and protective.

403
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:40,569
JACKSON: The struggle to try and keep up
with this pride at night

404
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:43,973
is because they cross in places that
a vehicle would not be able to cross.

405
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,373
Once you lose them, you know,
they do stuff behind your back.

406
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:50,807
So you are having to be
on the go the whole time.

407
00:51:52,497 --> 00:51:58,015
After following the lions all night,
they still haven't seen a kill.

408
00:51:58,057 --> 00:52:03,211
Warren, on the day shift, discovers
there's a very good reason why.

409
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:07,250
Ideally, the situation we wanted here
was big herds of wildebeest,

410
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:09,686
we wanted to get lions making kills,

411
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:11,534
but the rains have come a little early,

412
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:13,613
so most of the animals
are up on the plains.

413
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:16,569
All we've got now are small groups
of five or six wildebeest.

414
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:20,053
So we're really hoping that one of
those groups of lions gets lucky

415
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:22,213
and that they manage to kill
one of them.

416
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:25,090
OVER RADIO: No more groups of wildebeest.
Just that one group you can see.

417
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:29,176
Four more days pass
and no lion kills have been seen.

418
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:33,611
Finally, they get a shred of luck.

419
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,812
We've got a big herd of wildebeest

420
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:40,167
going through the horizon
heading to the crossings again.

421
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:43,368
We may have a chance again of a kill.

422
00:52:47,657 --> 00:52:51,127
The crew head off on the heels
of the Dorobo.

423
00:52:51,177 --> 00:52:56,376
But after hours of tracking,
again there's no sign of a kill.

424
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:02,655
Jane and the night shift take over.

425
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:11,008
We've just come across the lionesses
and the male and all their cubs

426
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:14,333
on a kill, and we are about...

427
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:18,165
five metres away.

428
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:21,493
The adult male is sitting now
on a wildebeest kill.

429
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:29,092
We are not going to be able to film
this because, by the time it gets light,

430
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:32,209
they'll have finished it.

431
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:37,126
But it's absolutely amazing
to be able to see it so close.

432
00:53:38,377 --> 00:53:43,610

by 23 hungry lions.

at our back tyre,

Look at them!

439
00:54:27,777 --> 00:54:30,894
Not the Dorobo.
They say they do it all the time.

...it's terrifying.

By dawn, the lions have
finished the kill.

444
00:54:47,937 --> 00:54:54,172
At the shift change, the power
of the lion's bite is revealed.

445
00:54:54,217 --> 00:54:56,856
Look at that, it's amazing!

446
00:54:56,897 --> 00:55:01,095
Quite an adrenaline-filled night, really.

It's eight in the morning,
I've just finished my night shift,

448
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:07,573
and although we found lions on a kill,

449
00:55:07,617 --> 00:55:11,326
by the time Warren came out
and it was light enough for him to film,

450
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:15,006
the carcass was pretty much
ripped apart.

451
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:18,611
You know, we've only got
a few more days left.

452
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:24,727
At last they get the news everyone's
been waiting for.

453
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:28,292
The pride they've been following
has made a fresh kill.

454
00:55:28,337 --> 00:55:31,773
It's light enough to film,
and the Dorobo are ready.

455
00:55:43,617 --> 00:55:46,654
We are just trying to find a position
where we can get a clear view.

456
00:55:46,697 --> 00:55:48,574
There's too much brush in the way.

457
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:53,612
The crew are still worried about
the Dorobos'safety.

458
00:56:51,737 --> 00:56:54,251
JACKSON: I didn't believe
that we would get this shot.

459
00:56:54,297 --> 00:56:56,936
I thought the lions would
attack these guys,

460
00:56:56,977 --> 00:56:59,172
especially when they had their cubs.

461
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:02,846
But all of a sudden,
when the big male got up and ran,

462
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:07,334
I was relieved, because I thought
he would be the one which will attack us,

463
00:57:07,377 --> 00:57:12,212
but I'm really, really chuffed.
Great stuff! Ay-ay-ah!

464
00:57:16,177 --> 00:57:20,056
The special connection I've got
with the Dorobo is the lifestyle.

465
00:57:20,097 --> 00:57:25,296
It's pretty sad to know
that it's about to disappear.

466
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:31,651
The time that I've spent with these guys,
I think it's too short.

467
00:57:31,697 --> 00:57:36,612
I've realised how much I have lost
and how much I have learnt so far

468
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,933
since I have been with them
in the last two weeks.

469
00:57:41,377 --> 00:57:46,246
I would be very happy
if this has been captured for my kids

470
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:49,016
and the rest of the generations
of the Dorobo kids,

471
00:57:49,057 --> 00:57:52,686
and be proud that our ancestors,
our fathers, our elders

472
00:57:52,737 --> 00:57:56,013

scary experience.
