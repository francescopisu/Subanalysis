Cameraman Keith Partridge last met Berik
in June with his newborn chick.

341
00:49:45,137 --> 00:49:49,608
It's now November and bitterly cold -
an ideal time for hunting,

342
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:53,889
when wolves, foxes and rabbits
all have thick winter coats.

343
00:49:55,297 --> 00:49:56,889
Unlike the wildlife,

344
00:49:56,937 --> 00:50:00,976
the old Russian trucks
are not well adapted to the cold

345
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:04,009
so the drivers devise a novel solution.

346
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:08,817
Keith opts for a different ride.

347
00:50:08,857 --> 00:50:10,290
KEITH: The fact is

348
00:50:10,337 --> 00:50:13,807
that I haven't even ridden a donkey
across Blackpool beach.

349
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,495
And we've now got to go up there

350
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:17,129
on one of these.

351
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:19,168
Does my horse have a name?

352
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,572
They don't have names?

353
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:27,209
The Mongolians have more than 300 words

354
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,010
just to describe the horse colours.

355
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:31,046
Wow!

356
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:36,251
You know that to make it go,
you slightly kick and you should say,

357
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:38,367
- ''Shu!''
- OK, shall we follow Agii?

358
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:39,930
Thank you.

359
00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:41,774
That's it. Shu!

360
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,648
Shu!

361
00:50:44,817 --> 00:50:46,728
Shu!

362
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,850
Eventually Keith finds the gears
and off he goes.

363
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,169
After three hours, the trucks catch up,

364
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:59,970
and Keith's only too happy
to leave his horse behind.

365
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:01,530
(BALAPAN CHEEPS)

366
00:51:03,177 --> 00:51:04,292
What does he think?

367
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:14,253
Except my nose? (CHUCKLES)

368
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:16,049
Is it too big?

369
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,290
There you go, no frostbite!

370
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:30,449
Keith heads off
to test a small ''eagle-cam';

371
00:51:30,497 --> 00:51:33,933
for which Sailau has made a harness.

372
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:38,896
There are cameras out there that
might give us a better picture quality

373
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:40,529
but they're much bigger

374
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:43,774
so we're playing this trade-off game
all the time

375
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:46,285
between practicalities and quality.

376
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,567
Anyway, we'll see how it goes.

377
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:57,375
Sailau's eagle seems to fly quite happily
with the eagle-cam on her back.

378
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:02,491
Encouraged by the first test,
they use a heavier high-definition camera.

379
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:06,094
This will be amazing if this works.

380
00:52:06,137 --> 00:52:08,810
We don't even know
if the bird will take the weight.

381
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:12,372
We might have overloaded the plane,
so to speak.

382
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:22,248
The eagle flies beautifully.
Keith and the team head back to base,

383
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:25,733
joining director Nic Brown
to view the results.

384
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:27,290
It's a very tense moment.

385
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:30,886
The locals join in for a bird's-eye view.

386
00:52:30,937 --> 00:52:34,725
They've never seen their eagles
quite like this before.

387
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,335
- The hood's off!
- Hood's off.

388
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:39,289
Off we go. Whoa!

389
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:43,410
- How small, my God. Really wild!
- Look at his head!

390
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:50,457
Wow, look at that banking round
with the head.

391
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:55,127
Wow! That's pretty wicked, isn't it.

392
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:58,332
The next day,

393
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:02,689
the crew follow Berik and his young eagle
on their first fox hunt.

394
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:04,807
The hunters shadow sweepers -

395
00:53:04,857 --> 00:53:08,691
men who flush the foxes
out into the open.

396
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:12,849
The team must constantly move
from peak to peak

397
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:15,650
to give the eagles the best chance
of seeing a fox.

398
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:18,769
Sailau thinks that the fox
might be hiding

399
00:53:18,817 --> 00:53:22,935
over these small mounds
just behind these telegraph lines.

400
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:26,811
He would like to go to one of those hills
and wait there.

401
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:29,769
It seems to make sense
that we've got to head there.

402
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:32,206
Well, you'd better be fast, mate,
cos he's just gone.

403
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,246
There he goes.

404
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,650
(LAUGHING)

405
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:41,172
After packing up quickly,
the film crew race after the hunters.

406
00:53:42,217 --> 00:53:46,813
But as soon as Keith starts filming,
the plans seem to change yet again.

407
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,327
Sailau's now moved off again
so, er, time to go.

408
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:53,572
We've only been here for two minutes.

409
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,212
This set the pattern of the day.

410
00:53:57,257 --> 00:54:00,932
As Sailau and Berik
move from peak to peak,

411
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:06,688
so do the team, constantly playing
catch-up in the thin high-altitude air.

412
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:10,776
Finally, near exhaustion,
they face a new problem.

413
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:14,934
Where is Sailau?

414
00:54:16,097 --> 00:54:18,292
They call the director.

415
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:21,135
Nic, Nic. This is Keith,
do you read? Over.

416
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:23,213
NIC: Hi, yeah, how are you?

417
00:54:23,257 --> 00:54:28,126
We're on our third mountain range
of the day so far and still no luck, over.

418
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:31,328
Which mountain range
are you on now? Over.

419
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:35,129
ZUBIN: If only we knew!

420
00:54:35,177 --> 00:54:38,249
Behind us are the really big peaks
with no snow on.

421
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:40,492
The terrain here is pretty wild, actually,

422
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:42,812
and if anything's
going to be lurking about,

423
00:54:42,857 --> 00:54:45,929
I think I'd want to hide
around here somewhere.

424
00:54:45,977 --> 00:54:48,889
ZUBIN: Something's in front
of that telegraph pole. Is that a dog?

425
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,165
KEITH: Let's get the lens on it.

426
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,329
It's not a wolf, it's a cow!

427
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,414
I never said it was a wolf,
I said it was moving.

428
00:55:00,457 --> 00:55:01,446
That is very true!

429
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:04,250
Do I get the sense that delirium

430
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:07,972
is beginning to set in
on the third mountain range of the day?

431
00:55:08,017 --> 00:55:10,406
Would you like some chocolate bars?

432
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:15,611
Agii, every day, just at the point
where we are about to faint...

433
00:55:18,257 --> 00:55:20,725
You bust your teeth on them!

434
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:24,816
I could ask you, Agii, if you could
keep them somewhere slightly warmer!

435
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:33,368
They set off yet again.

436
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:38,172
Keith and the team are beginning to wonder
if they'll ever film a hunt.

437
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:40,412
But then, good news.

438
00:55:40,457 --> 00:55:42,209
We have seen a fox.

439
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:45,731
It scarpered really fast
down that snowy slope.

440
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:47,813
The guys are over there at the moment,

441
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:50,451
trying to see where it's hunkered down.

442
00:55:50,497 --> 00:55:52,135
Once they're out on the snow,

443
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:55,408
you can see them pretty easily cos it's
a little black dot, scarpering like hell.

444
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:58,608
But, um, apart from that,
you see this place.

445
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:02,616
It's utterly vast. It's like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

446
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:07,367
Suddenly there's a call from the valley
and the hunt is on.

447
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,091
Everybody clear the front of frame,
please.

448
00:56:11,137 --> 00:56:12,126
Now!

(BERIK MAKES MEWING WHOOPS)

450
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:33,374
KEITH: I think the fox
has made a hasty escape.

451
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:38,696
Both Balapan and the crew
have learned a lot on their first hunt.

452
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,692
Still...the team
have yet to film a successful hunt.

453
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:50,175
After several frustrating days,
the pressure to deliver is intense.

454
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:57,173
We're fast running out of time, really.
It hasn't been looking very good.

455
00:56:57,217 --> 00:57:01,415
Just when the crew
are resigned to failure, a call is heard.

456
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:10,212
Keith knows this is his and Balapan's
big chance to succeed.

The bird got it! My word.

459
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,890
KEITH: When all those whoops go off,

460
00:57:43,937 --> 00:57:49,250
things just go from nought to a million
miles an hour in two or three seconds.

461
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:52,653
Your heart races
when you are doing this sort of stuff,

462
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:54,688
and you just have to respond
in a kind of a positive way.

463
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:59,015
You know,just try and stay totally
focused on what you are here to do.

464
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:02,367
When that adrenaline kicks in,
it's easy to get distracted,

465
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,009
but you have to just think,

466
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:06,127
''Right, now is the time
I've got to up my game,

467
00:58:06,177 --> 00:58:10,648
''really knuckle down and focus in
on getting the shot and making it work.''

468
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:13,655
And also trying to build
some form of relationship

469
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:15,972
with the people
that you are working with as well.

470
00:58:16,017 --> 00:58:17,416
So that they trust us

471
00:58:17,457 --> 00:58:21,973
and welcome us into what's
quite an intimate part of their lives.
