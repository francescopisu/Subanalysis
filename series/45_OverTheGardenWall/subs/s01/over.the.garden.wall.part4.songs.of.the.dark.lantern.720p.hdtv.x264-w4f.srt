168
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,689
- This ain't no love song. [Sniffling]
- It's a metaphor. [Crying]

169
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,724
- Keep it together, tailor.
- Hey!

170
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,559
- Uh, yes?
- I know what you are!

171
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,094
- You're a pilgrim!
- What? What, like the ...

172
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,897
the guys who eat turkey
and cranberry sauce?

173
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,766
- No, you're a pilgrim!
- A pilgrim?

174
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,934
You're a traveler
on a sacred journey.

175
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,103
You're the master
of your own destiny.

176
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:18,440
- The hero of your own story!
- A pilgrim.

177
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:21,476
<i>Tell us your feats, pilgrim!
What other challenges </i>

178
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,528
<i>- have you overcome?
- Regale us with your travels, pilgrim!</i>

179
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:27,118
One time, Wirt fell on a gorilla.
[all cheering]

180
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,718
And helped me find this frog.
[All cheering]

181
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,653
<i>- More! Tell us more!
- Tell us more!</i>

182
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,789
<i>Let the cat out of the bag!
We want to hear it!</i>

183
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,042
And, oh, uh, I met this
helpful woodsman who told us

184
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,711
which direction to go to avoid beast.

185
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:42,664
- All: [gasp] The beast!
- The beast.

186
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,533
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh, you guys have heard of

187
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:48,045
- the beast, too?
- We all know the beast, pilgrim.

188
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:52,015
♪ He lurks out there in the Unknown ♪

189
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:55,900

[Blows]

198
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,177
Wait, wait, wait! Lantern?

199
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:31,012
The woodsman was the guy with
the weird lantern, not the beast.

200
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:35,071
Pilgrim, he who carries the
dark lantern must be the beast.

201
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,946
What? 
No, the woodsman's a good guy.

202
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,488
He warned us of the beast and
told us which direction

203
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,471
- to go to avoid him.
- And now you're more

204
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:44,576
- lost than ever, huh?
- Yeah, but...

205
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,661
Oh, yeah, hey, can you
give us some directions?

206
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,114
Our friend Beatrice is trying
to take us to Adelaide

207
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,999
of the pasture, the
good woman of the woods.

208
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,869
- She can help us get home.
- You don't need directions, pilgrim.

209
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:57,372
- You follow that compass 
inside your heart.  - Uh...

210
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:00,152
- No, I think we need directions.
- Aah!

211
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:02,344
- [Gasps] Beatrice!
- Go save your friend and get

212
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,679
yourself home!
[All cheering, shouting]

213
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,515
<i>- Pilgrim!
- You got it!</i>

214
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,384
Uh... Okay.

215
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,720
<i>Never say die, never say die!
[All cheering]</i>

216
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:15,318
Oh, boy, I guess
I'm really doing this.

217
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,360
Horse, I'm just gonna pretend
like I can ride you, all right?

218
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:23,398
[Grunts]
[Neighing]

219
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,318
<i>Beatrice!
[Creature howling in distance]</i>

220
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:28,653
Beatrice?
[Wind whistling]

221
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:31,289
- Another one of those trees.
- Halt!

222
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:32,574
[Gasps]
It's you!

223
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,830
- Hey, Mr. Woodsman!
- I told you to leave these woods!

224
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,329
[Gasps]
Beatrice!

225
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,464
You're turning her
into an edelwood tree!

226
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,801
<i>[gasps] 
You were the beast all along!</i>

227
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,353
[Blows]
Huh?!

228
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,422
[Whinnying]
Whoa! Huh?!

229
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,674
- What is this?
- Greg, get Beatrice!

230
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,761
[Grunting]
What are you doing?!

231
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:56,982
Boys, the beast is upon you! 
Agh!

232
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:00,602
Oh!
[Gasps]

233
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,551
[Neighing]

234
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:06,730
[Sighs]

235
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,694
- Beatrice, you all right?
- Yeah, I just ... I saw a weird shadow

236
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,831
and then stupidly flew
into a tree and got knocked out.

237
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,783
Oh, well, we're all right now.

238
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,806
Wirt was amazing! 
He sang a song, rode a horse,

239
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,592
and saved you from the axe guy!
 He's the pilgrim!

240
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:23,728
That's all well and good,
but you were supposed

241
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,063
- to get directions.
- I did.

242
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,982
We just got directions from
Fred before you woke up.

243
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:30,185
- Who?
- Oh, uh, Beatrice, meet Fred the horse.

244
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:34,606
- Nice to horse your acquaintance.
- You can talk?!

245
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,716
[Neighs, laughs]

246
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:40,454
<i>Man: It seems you're
running out of oil, woodsman.</i>

247
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,873
<i>Why not let me take
the lantern for awhile?</i>

248
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,435
Begone, beast!

249
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,811
I've fought you for the lantern
before, and I'll fight you again!

250
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,460
<i>No need for violence,
woodsman, but be sure</i>

251
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:54,075
<i>to keep it lit, or your daughter's flame</i>

252
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:57,946
<i>will go out... forever.</i>

253
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:01,438
<i>Now, what direction
did those children go?</i>

254
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,685
You leave those children be!
