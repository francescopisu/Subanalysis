3
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:39,351
Yeah! Whoo!

4
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,903
Ahh.

5
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:43,689
What a nice way to spend
our last day ... going to

6
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:45,524
Adelaide's house.
Our journey is finally over.

7
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,068
Pretty soon I'll be back home.

8
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:49,199
I won't have to worry
about that Woodsman

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,330
or that beast or whatever,
and you won't have

10
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,698
to put up with us anymore.
Bet you're pretty happy,

11
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,336
- huh, Beatrice?
- Huh? Oh. Yeah. Sure.

12
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:01,184
You all right? You
sound uncharacteristically wistful.

13
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,543
- What? Sorry. Just thinking.
- Hmm.

14
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:08,180
* Oh, we're going to the pasture
to meet Adelaide and ask her *

15
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:12,184
* if she has a way to send
us back where we came from *

16
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,638
* I don't know who she is or how
she is or when, what, why she is *

17
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,433
<i>* But as for where she is,
she is where we will go *</i>

18
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,144
<i>* to Adelaide, to Adelaide *</i>

19
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,397
<i>* Come on and join the Adelaide parade *</i>

20
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,125
<i>* Adelaide, to Adelaide *</i>

21
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:34,419
<i>* we're going to
Adelaide's house today *</i>

22
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:38,160
Boy. Finally going home.

23
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:41,330
Hey, what's with Beatrice?

24
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,833
I don't know. What's
with George Washington

25
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,418
being naked?

26
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:50,030
- What?
- All the other frogs are dressed up nice.

27
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:55,511
He's an outcast, and he's cold.

28
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,180
- Feel these cold feet.
- No.

29
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,261
He's supposed to be
cold, Greg. He's a frog.

30
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,686
- But he's our frog!
- Well, he's not my frog ...

31
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,605
or she's not my frog.
We don't really know its gender.

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,607
Come on, George.

33
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:11,493
You're a manly frog,
and you need some socks.

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,781
Huh?

35
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,583
Uh-oh.
It looks like we're in trouble.

36
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,777
It's 'cause the president is nude!

37
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,177
It's probably 'cause you snuck on

38
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:22,288
- without paying.
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,256
But that's because Greg
threw all our money away.

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,508
Take him, not me!

41
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,298
Sorry!

42
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,356
Tadpoles! Your babies!

43
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:56,822
Ahh.

44
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,824
<i>Good day, gentle...</i>

45
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,793
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

46
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:04,546
<i>We ... I ... must be
going now to join the band.</i>

47
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,467
<i>- Wirt, drum me!
- Okay.</i>

48
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,670
<i>Ow! Ow, ow!
Ow! Ow, ow!</i>

49
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,756
Are we good?

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,342
- Whew! I think so.
- Wirt, sometimes you got

51
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,761
to face your problems.
Turn yourself in and get

52
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,180
- kicked off this boat.
- I don't think today's a good

53
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,682
- day to get arrested by frogs.
- Hmm. Well...

54
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,602
<i>- Hey! What's going on?
- Don't push me!</i>

55
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:29,071
<i>Oof! Oof! Oof!</i>

56
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,691
Okay, everybody.

57
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,493
- Act natural.
- Drum me! Drum me!

58
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,663
- I said, "act natural."
- It is natural! I'm a drum!

59
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:44,336
Wirt, drum me!

60
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,872
- Drum me in the face!
- Okay! Okay! Shh!

61
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,375
Don't draw attention to us!

62
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,715
Whoa!

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,385
- Whoa!
- No bassoon player.

64
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,203
Uh-oh.

65
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,558
Dog, those frogs
really love the bassoon!

66
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,310
Huh?

67
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,396
- Hmm.
- Oh, no.

68
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,398
Beatrice, I'm too young
to go to frog jail.

69
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,483
Hey, why don't you play the bassoon?

70
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,735
That'll get us kicked
off this boat for sure.

71
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,353
No, Greg's right.

72
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,439
You should play it.
Go ahead. You'll do fine.

73
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,824
- You play instruments, right?
- Yeah, but bassoon and

74
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,611
clarinet are way different.
I don't have the embouchure

75
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,362
for bassoon. I mean,
the lower and middle

76
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,364
ranges have some
similarities in terms of ...

77
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,533
- Wirt, you can do it.
- Seriously, nobody wants

78
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,785
- to hear me play.
- I do!

79
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,954
I do!

80
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:40,459
Uh...

81
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,595
- Wirt?
- Yeah. Here we go.

82
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:49,168
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

83
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,943
* At night when
the lake is a mirror *

84
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,478
- Huh?
- Whoa!

85
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:03,949
* And the moon rides
the waves to the shore *

86
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:08,370
* a single soul sets his voice singing *

87
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:13,408
* content to be slightly forlorn *

88
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,663
* a song rises over the lilies *
* wah-ooh, wah-ooh *

89
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:22,000
* sweeps high to
clear over the reeds *

90
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:26,805
* and over the bullrushes swaying *

91
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,259
* to pluck at a pair of heartstrings *

92
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,345
Hey, Beatrice, thanks for
supporting my bassooning.

93
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:36,682
- Yeah. You're actually good.
- The best part is we're still

94
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:39,768
- on track to get to Adelaide's.
- Yep. That's great.

95
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:42,821
- You don't seem thrilled.
- Well, I just ...

96
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:45,857
I don't want you to ...
never mind. Never mind.

97
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:52,447
* carries their memory on *

98
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,736
- Shh!
- Uh...

99
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,709
* Over the treetops and mountains *

100
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,446
* over the blackened ravines *

101
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:13,639
- Ohh!  - # Then softly it falls
by a house near a stream #

102
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,589
* and over the garden wall *

103
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,385
* To thee *

104
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:28,147
<i>I knew you were special.</i>

105
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,043
What are they doing?

106
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:43,665
Looks like they're...
hibernating in the mud.

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,917
So, where's Adelaide's
house? Is it close?

108
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,253
It's ... hmm.
We should probably just go

109
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,789
tomorrow, I think. We
don't want to bother her

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,008
- too late, you know?
- What are we supposed to do ...

111
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,176
just sit around in the
mud with these frogs?

112
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,796
I call that mud over there!

113
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,048
 Yeah!

114
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:04,469
- So, then what?
- Well, then I went to go talk

115
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:07,105
to Sara ... I mean, like really
talk to her, you know ...

116
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,224
- put all my cards on the table, you know?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:12,894
And then Jason Funderberker
comes out of nowhere

118
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,196
and whisks her away!
Ugh! Jason Funderberker ...

119
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,198
<i>that guy.</i>

120
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,484
<i>Plus Greg was around.
He would have embarrassed</i>

121
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,069
<i>- me even more.
- Well, Wirt, sounds like</i>

122
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:23,488
- you're a real loser back home.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

123
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,490
I mean compared to how you are here.

124
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,576
Here you're like a
hero and stuff, right?

125
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,628
Am I?
Well, I don't know if I'd say,

126
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,830
- "hero," but ...
- Do you think that I could

127
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:32,964
be a hero, too? Huh?

128
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,888
You done good, Mr. President.
You done good.

129
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,757
If I was you, I wouldn't
even want to go home.

130
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,060
Yeah, but I-I can't stay here forever.

131
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,896
- Why not?
- Hmm? Why not?

132
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,733
Because ... because
I-I can't just ... maybe it is

133
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:53,685
- better to stay here.
- Great. Then it's agreed.

134
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,654
We're not going to Adelaide's.
Good night, Wirt.

135
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:58,740
Oh, what?
Oh. Good night, Beatrice.

136
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,406
Beatrice.

137
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,187
- Greg, wake up!
- Huh?

138
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,022
- Beatrice took off!
- What?

139
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:19,110
- Come on!
- Mmm.

140
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:24,255
<i>- Come on, Greg!
- I'm coming.</i>

141
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:39,864
Close the flue.
That fresh air does simply

142
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,834
gruesome things to my
tender, delicate skin.

143
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:46,621
- Adelaide, we need to talk.
- Did you bring me what I asked for?

144
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:49,808
I found two brothers lost in the woods,

145
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,060
but I can't give them to you, Adelaide.

146
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,129
- They need to go home.
- Nonsense!

147
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,231
I'll give them a wonderful home here.

148
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:59,534
- That's what you said, but ...
- Can't you see I'm sick

149
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:01,202
and helpless?

150
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,139
Ah-choo!
I'm all alone in the world.

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,808
- I want a child servant.
- Servant?

152
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,611
I thought you just wanted
some yard work done.

153
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:13,081
Our arrangement was for you
to bring me a child servant and

154
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:16,975
then I give you the scissors...

155
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,504
to snip, snip, snip your

156
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,040
family's wings away to
make them human again.

157
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:24,125
What if I became your servant?

158
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:27,712
Ha! I need a big, strong child!

159
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,964
You can turn me into
a human, can't you?

160
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:35,053
- Oh, yes ... scissors!
- Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,472
So, give me the scissors.
I'll go help my family.

162
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,474
- Wirt!
- Close the door!

163
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,976
- I'll catch my death of cold!
- What's going on?

164
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,729
- You shouldn't be here.
- Adelaide?

165
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,811
Welcome home, children.

166
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,984
<i>Huh? </i>

167
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,921
- Beatrice, wh-what ...
- I...

168
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:57,919
- But I thought we were friends.
- Now they're mine.

169
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,439
And once I fill their heads with wool,

170
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,698
they'll become just like
little sheep and follow

171
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,101
- my every command.
- All along, you've been

172
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:10,333
- leading us to this crazy lady?
- I do as he commands ...

173
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:15,727
the voice of the night,
the beast of eternal darkness.

174
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,096
What are you doing?!

175
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,733
Ohh! The night air is poisonous!

176
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,652
Breathe it in, lady.
Wirt, Greg, let's go!

177
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:26,688
- The deadly... air!
- Whoa! Geez!

178
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:29,157
- She wasn't kidding!
- It's fresh!

179
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:30,825
- Ohhhhhh!
- Huh?

180
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,610
Wirt? Greg?

181
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,733
Greg! Wirt!

182
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:43,238
It wasn't what it looked like!
I was just ... please come back!

183
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:46,040
Ohh.

184
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:50,712
- Hmm.
- Wirt, what about Beatrice?

185
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:54,549
Hmm.
I shouldn't have trusted anyone.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,986
Huh?

187
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:02,524
Benjamin Franklin!

188
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:05,163
Hurry it up, Greg.

189
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,897
