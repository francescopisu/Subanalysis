1
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,887
Led through the mist

2
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,469
By the milk light of moon

3
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,535
All that was lost

4
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:21,623
Is revealed

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,185
Our long-bygone burdens

6
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:28,516
Mere echoes of the spring

7
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:32,285
But where have we come

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,463
And where shall we end?

9
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,136
If dreams can't come true

10
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:44,345
Then why not pretend?

11
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:48,999
How the gentle wind

12
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,376
Beckons through the leaves

13
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,632
As autumn colors fall

14
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:04,529
Somewhere lost in the clouded
annals of history

15
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,984
lies a place that a few have seen -

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,215
a mysterious place called The Unknown.

17
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:18,194
Where long-forgotten stories are revealed
to those who travel through the wood.

18
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:19,358
Annual Gugelheim,

19
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,618
Albert Salami,

20
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,227
Giggly Jumpy Tom,

21
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,658
Thomas Tambourine,

22
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:24,932
Legs Hans McCollen,

23
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,737
Artichoke, Penguin, Pete, Steve.

24
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:31,730
But I think the very worst
name for this frog is-

25
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,516
Wait! Wait a second. Uh...

26
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,125
Greg.

27
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,896
Where are we?

28
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,453
- In the woods?
- I mean...

29
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,939
What are we doing out here?

30
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,143
We're walking home.

31
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:49,475
Greg! I think we're lost.

32
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:51,004
We should've left a trail or something!

33
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,692
I can leave a trail of candy from my pants.

34
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:56,046
No.

35
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:59,053
Though I am lost
My wounded heart resides back home

36
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:03,084
In pieces
Strung about the graveyard of my lost love.

37
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,417
For only-

38
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:06,226
Do you hear that?

39
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:07,745
Yeah.

40
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,951
Do you think it is some kind of deranged lunatic with an axe
waiting out there in the darkness for his next victims?

41
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:12,972
Greg.

42
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:13,783
Greg!

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,357
Uh.

44
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:18,026
Greg, you're gonna get us into trouble again!

45
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,309
We should ask him for help.

46
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,725
No. We should not ask him for help.

47
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:29,065
- But-
- Shush!

48
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,409
- You shush!
- Shhhh-

49
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:31,344
You shush!

50
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,162
Shoot. You think
we should've asked him for help?

51
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,112
Maybe I can help you?

52
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:40,785
I mean, you guys are lost, right?

53
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,768
What in the world is going on?

54
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:48,463
Well, you are slapping yourself,
and I'm answering your question, and-

55
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:52,188
No, Greg. A bird's brain isn't big enough
for cognisant speech.

56
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:53,247
Hey, what was that?!

57
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:55,218
I mean I'm just saying you are weird...

58
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:56,818
like, not normal.

59
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,850
I mean-
Oh my gosh, stop talking to it, Wirt

60
00:02:58,997 --> 00:02:59,746
IT?

61
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,243
What are you doing here!?

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,425
Explain yourselves!

63
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,073
And I'll see you guys later. Bye!

64
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,590
Calm- Calm down mister!
Whatever you do here is your business.

65
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,915
We- We just wanna get home
with all our legs and arms attached.

66
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,949
These woods are no place for children.

67
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,990
Don't you know the Beast is afoot here?!

68
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,916
The Beast? We- we- we don't
know anything about that!

69
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,577
We're just two lost kids trying to get home!

70
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,845
Well... Welcome to The Unknown, boys.

71
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,726
You are more lost than you realize.

72
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,496
I found this homestead abandoned,

73
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:34,041
repurposed its mill for my needs.

74
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,726
You and your brother
should be safe here while I work.

75
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,950
Candy trail, candy trail. Can-dy trail!

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,143
What- what is your work exactly?

77
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,211
Everyone has a torch to burn...

78
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,202
and this here is mine.

79
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:57,538
I grind the heart of the Eldelwood
trees into oil, to keep this lantern lit.

80
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,929
This is my... lot in life. This is my burden.

81
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,546
This guy sounds loony.

82
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,461
Maybe we should make a break for it.

83
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,420
If we can.

84
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,546
But he must know the woods really well,
so we may need to knock him out first.

85
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:10,328
Except that may turn out really badly, huh?

86
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:11,590
Y- yeah. Bad-bad plan..

87
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,409
Forget it.

88
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:13,780
Okay.

89
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,314
What are you boys whispering about?

90
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:15,649
Bad plan.

91
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,510
We're talking about running away out of here.

92
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:18,629
Sh-shush

93
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:19,194
Sh!

94
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:20,029
Shu-SH

95
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,245
Leave if you wish, but remember -

96
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:30,599
The Beast haunts these woods,
ever singing his mournful melody.

97
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:33,156
In search of lost souls such as yourselves.

98
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,470
No, not to help you

99
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:36,205
To help us?

100
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,579
I have work to do in the mill.

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,284
When I'm finished I'll do what I can to
guide you if you are still here when I return.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,326
Huh! I guess we could just leave...

103
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,274
I don't know. Greg!

104
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:52,257
What?

105
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:55,815
Do you think there really
is a beast out there?

106
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,473
Or is that guy just messing with us?

107
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:58,631
Uh huh.

108
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:02,300
I mean he could've done away with us by now
if that was his plan.

109
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,350
And he lit that fire. That's pretty nice.

110
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:06,102
Yeah!

111
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,285
I guess it's possible there is a beast...

112
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,197
Since there was a talking bird, but-

113
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,588
Yeaah.

114
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:17,545
Sometimes I feel like I'm just
like a boat upon a winding river.

115
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,780
I don't know.

116
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,709
Twisting towards an endless black sea.

117
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:25,229
Further and further,
drifitng away from where I want to be.

118
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,729
WHO I want to be.

119
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:28,636
Oh. I didn't know that.

120
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,001
Did you know that if you soak a raisin
in grape juice it turns into a grape?

121
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,187
IT'S A ROCK FACT!

122
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,902
Uhh. You are not helping at all.

123
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,250
Why don't you go play with
your frog or something?

124
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,370
Oh beans! Where is that frog o' mine?

125
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,885
Hold on there a second, brother o' mine.

126
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:45,361
I'll be back soon for your plan.

127
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:54,467
Kitty. Kitty!

128
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,123
Now where did that frog named Kitty go?

129
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,074
Whoop!

130
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:59,593
I tripped on my own candy trail!

131
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,631
That frog is giving me the runaround!

132
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,322
Kitty!

133
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:31,284
Gross!

134
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:32,749
Kitty?

135
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:37,793
Hmm. Is that-

136
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:39,289
Oh there you are!

137
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,124
Whoop!

138
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,074
Wirt?

139
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,372
Kitty?

140
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,450
You have beautiful eyes!

141
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,545
Yuhh.

142
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:57,712
Greg?

143
00:06:59,109 --> 00:06:59,845
Uuhhh.

144
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,188
What's happening? Where is your brother?

145
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:08,734
Holy moley! Hot dog!

146
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:12,657
It's the Beast!

147
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,538
Stay back, boys!

148
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,867
This creature is known as-

149
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:17,854
Huh?

150
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,204
Oooh m-

151
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:21,469
Greg, why did you do that?!

152
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,664
That was your plan, remember?

153
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:23,886
Knock him out!

154
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,354
No! Bad plan! I told you to forget that plan.

155
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,036
AAAH

156
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,131
Spank. Spank. Spank!

157
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,930
Run run run run run! RUN!

158
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,814
Candy Camouflage!

159
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,773
Run run run run run run...

160
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:46,650
Greg!

161
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:47,632
This is amazing, huh?

162
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,811
Am I supposed to throw something?

163
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,319
Oh yeah! Ha ha!

164
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,660
He's eating your candy.

165
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:09,070
I wonder if he ate my help candy trail
that led to this mill!

166
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:12,430
Ahh Greg! You led the Beast
right to us with your candy!

167
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:22,980
Hey! Give me the axe.

168
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,371
You are too little to have it anyway.

169
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,029
Aaah! We- we gotta move out of here!

170
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,029
AH! Uuh. Greg! Give him
the rest of your candy!

171
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:45,403
Oops.

172
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,521
Hey, Wirt! Look!

173
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,416
Greg?

174
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:03,108
Wirt, he spitted out that turtle
and now he's my new best friend!

175
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:04,654
Oh!

176
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:05,603
Ow.

177
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,558
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,014
Ain't that just the way...

179
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,442
The mill is destroyed!

180
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,357
The oil! All gone!

181
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:18,488
Bu- but look!
We got the Beast problem solved!

182
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:23,253
THE DOG?
THAT IS NOT THE BEAST!

183
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:27,585
The Beast cannot be mollified
like some farmer's pet!

184
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,131
He stalks like the night!

185
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:32,883
He sings like the four winds!

186
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,471
He's the death of hope!

187
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,180
He steals the children.

188
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,390
And he'll roam the...

189
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,125
You're always messing up, Greg!

190
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,669
Boy! You have it backwards!

191
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,573
You are the elder child!

192
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,004
You are responsible

193
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,012
for you and you brother's actions!

194
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,083
Um- um. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:56,608
Maybe I can fix it?

196
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,450
I- I can't fix it.

197
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,330
You must go.

198
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,409
Take your brother North. Look for a town.

199
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:04,032
Come on, Greg.

200
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,967
Yeah. Thanks.

201
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,526
One last thing...

202
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,022
Beware The Unknown!

203
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:10,580
Fear the Beast!

204
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,751
And leave these woods...!

205
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,354
If you can.

206
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,376
It is your burden to bear!

207
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:20,235
Right. Yeah. Got it.

208
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:21,766
And little one...

209
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,529
You look after that frog.
Give him a proper name.

210
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,979
Okay!

211
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,598
Wirt? I think I thought
of a new name for our frog.

212
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:37,510
I'm gonna call him Wirt!

213
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:39,456
That's gonna be really confusing.

214
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,782
No. I'm gonna call you Kitty.

215
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:42,674
What?!

216
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,631
Maybe I'll start calling you Candypants.

217
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,061
Wow! Yeah!

218
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,986
Good one, Wirt!

219
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,117
Thanks.

220
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:50,243
I'm talking to Wirt!

221
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,178
I'm not talking to you.
