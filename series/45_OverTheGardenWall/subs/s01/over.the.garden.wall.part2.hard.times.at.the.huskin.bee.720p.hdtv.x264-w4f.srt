3
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,056
It's almost morning.

4
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,558
We should've found a town by now.

5
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,977
This is the way the woodsman
told us to go, right?

6
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,363
Have you listened to anything

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,648
I've been saying?
For the last couple hours,

8
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,234
I've been saying ...

9
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,204
Well, that settles it.
I'm gonna walk up 10 feet

10
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,405
- ahead of you.
- Help!

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,656
- Huh?
- I'm stuck!

12
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,376
- I hear something!
- It's probably nothing.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,729
Hey, look.
"Pottsfield, 1 mile."

14
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,666
- A town! Let's go this way.
- Okay, let's go this way.

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,071
- Not ... ugh.
- Hello? Hello?

16
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,572
- Hey, you.
- Who? Me?

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,774
- Yeah, you.
- Oh. Hello.

18
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,110
It's you again. I'm stuck.

19
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,145
Help me out of here,
and I'll owe you a favor.

20
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,382
- Whoa! I get a wish?
- No, no, no. Not a wish.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,751
I'm not magical.
I'll just do you a good turn.

22
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,554
- Can you turn me into a tiger?
- Um, no.

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,990
- I just said I'm not magical.
- It doesn't have to be

24
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,027
- a magical tiger.
- Greg, stop talking to a bush.

25
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,495
- Okay.
- Huh?

26
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,199
Thanks. I owe you a favor.
So, um, you two are lost kids

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,285
- with no purpose in life, right?
- Uh-huh.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,672
How about I bring you to
Adelaide of the pasture,

29
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,259
the good woman of the woods?
She could help you get home.

30
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,095
- Oh.
- N-No, no. No, no.

31
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,547
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Magic talking birds leading us

32
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,517
to fairy godmothers in the mysterious...

33
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,103
- I'm going to Pottsfield.
- Yeah, we're going

34
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,271
to Pottsfield. Come on.

35
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,274
- What about the favor?
- I'll think of my wish later.

36
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,820
Ohh.

37
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,152
So, let's small-talk.
My name's Greg. What's yours?

38
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,571
- Beatrice.
- My brother's name is Wirt.

39
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,991
- Who cares?
- And my frog's name's

40
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,245
- Wirt Jr., but that may change.
- Okay, that's great.

41
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,714
How about you and I ditch your brother?

42
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:31,750
Mm. Maybe later.
So, is it nice being a bird?

43
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,168
- Nope.
- Oh.

44
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,171
- Do you like waffles?
- No, waffles make me sick.

45
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,557
I eat... m-maggots.

46
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,509
- What?
- How can you not eat waffles?!

47
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,305
What?!

48
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:47,099
- I stepped on a pumpkin!
- Aha! Civilization, see?

49
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,100
Now ...

50
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:51,103
Huh? What the...

51
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:54,100
All right. Let's rejoin society.

52
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,366
Hello?
Hello? Hmm. See anybody?

53
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,453
No. Oh, I see you.

54
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:10,506
- Yeah, I see you, too, Greg.
- Hey, not to be obnoxious, but

55
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,091
an abandoned ghost town doesn't
seem like it's gonna be that

56
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,044
useful getting you guys home.

57
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,465
There's got to be somebody somewhere.

58
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,909
Excuse me?

59
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,303
Anyone here? Hello?

60
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,475
Oh. Sorry.
Uh, I'm looking for a phone.

61
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:33,145
Um, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,046
- Did you find anything?
- No. Where's Greg?

63
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,900
- Do you hear that?
- Huh?

64
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,118
<i> #... let spirits meet #</i>

00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,238

66
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,156

What the...

72
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,375
Oh, pardon me there.
Say, you folks ought to don your

73
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,410
vegetables and celebrate
the harvest with us.

74
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,152
Uh... Oh!

75
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,830
- You're wearing costumes.
- Well, sure.

76
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,301
Pumpkins can't move on
their own... can they?

77
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,222
- Ha. No. Yeah, no.
- Good thing I didn't take this off.

78
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:19,307
You guys find this place as

79
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,594
- creepy as I do, right?
- So it's some kind of weird cult

80
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,814
where they wear vegetable
costumes and dance

81
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,766
around a big thing.
They seem nice enough.

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,352
Okay, you're in denial.
That's fine.

83
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,855
But I'm just saying, something
feels off about this place.

84
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,409
Well, maybe I can find

85
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,778
someone here who will
give us a ride home.

86
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,864
Greg, you stay out of trouble.
Beatrice, thank you,

87
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,199
but you can leave.

88
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,251
I can't leave.
I'm honor-bound to help

89
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,538
you since you guys helped me.
That's the bluebird rules.

90
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,791
- Uh, okay.
- Beatrice, would you care

91
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,593
- for this dance?
- No thanks.

92
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:57,095
No thanks, no thanks.
I said no thank you.

93
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,102
Say, aren't you a little too... early?

94
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,388
- What do you mean.
- I mean it doesn't seem like

95
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,106
you're ready to join us just yet.

96
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:11,723
Join you?
Yeah, no, I'm just passing through.

97
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,228
Folks don't tend to "pass

98
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:16,698
- through" Pottsfield.
- Oh... Yeah?

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,118
- Yeah. It's nice here.
- Um, I'm really just looking

100
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,120
t-to leave here as fast as possible.

101
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,905
Eh, what, what?
Leave Pottsfield?

102
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,791
- Who wants to leave Pottsfield?!
- Huh?

103
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,826
<i>- What?
- He wants to leave Pottsfield.</i>

104
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,371
- What?
- Oh, are we leaving already?

105
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,164
Let's leave immediately.

106
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,882
I'm just trying to get home.

107
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,517
<i>They're not supposed to be here.</i>

108
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,319
<i>Maybe he's here to steal our crops.</i>

109
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,421
- To ruin our party.
- Or take off our pumpkin shoes!

110
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,306
Uh, no, I, uh ...

111
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,926
Now, hold on, everybody.

112
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,646
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

113
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,565
- Whoa.
- Enoch, what shall we

114
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,677
- do with them?
- I-I'm done.

115
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,736
Now, let's see here, boys.

116
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,106
How did you end up in
this little town of ours?

117
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,609
Well, we were trying to get home.

118
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,111
We came into town from the woods.

119
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,699
Uh, we saw your farms and
your houses and thought,

120
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,202
"hey, here's a normal
place with normal people."

121
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,120
And we both stepped on pumpkins.

122
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,624
Yeah, a-and then we heard
the music from the barn, and,

123
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,127
well, uh ... h-how about
we just leave?

124
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,847
Now, let me get this straight ...
you come to our town, you

125
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:26,434
trample our crops, you interrupt
our private engagement,

126
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,688
- and now you want to leave?
- Uh... Yes.

127
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,524
You'll never convict!
You have no proof!

128
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,110
- This one's trying to escape!
- Let me go!

129
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,446
- I don't know these clowns!
- Children, it saddens me that

130
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,817
you don't wish to stay here
with us, particularly because

131
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,620
I simply have to punish you
for your transgressions.

132
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,739
I told you this place was bad news.

133
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,088
So, by order of the Pottsfield

134
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,295
chamber of commerce,
 I find you guilty

135
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,465
of trespassing, destruction of
property, disturbing the peace,

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,051
- and murder.
- Murder?

137
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,370
Oh, no, not murder.

138
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:06,775
But for those other
crimes, I sentence you to...

139
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:11,179
- a few hours of manual labor.
- Wait. What? Really?

140
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:12,497
That's it?

141
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,051
<i>* Among the fields of straw and stover *</i>

142
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:21,415
<i>* clockin' till the workday's over *</i>

143
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:28,222
<i>* time's a gentle stream,
longer than it seems *</i>

144
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:32,284
<i>* patient is the night *</i>

145
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:37,122
<i>* how I long to see her face now *</i>

146
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,439
<i>* her starry, moonlit gaze now *</i>

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,533
<i>* I know she's never late,
so anxiously I wait *</i>

148
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,719
<i>* patient is the night *</i>

149
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,191
Just a few hours of manual labor,

150
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,594
- and we're almost done.
- And then what are you gonna do ...

151
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,731
just wander around this
way and that way through

152
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:07,452
- the woods forevermore?
- Uh, uh, maybe we'll just

153
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,237
stay here in Pottsfield.
It's nice here.

154
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,790
I don't know. I don't know.

155
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,576
Why do they even have
you digging these holes?

156
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,128
Planting seeds or something.

157
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,080
Maybe they're gonna bury you out here.

158
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,583
- Pbht!
- Hey! Buried treasure!

159
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,835
Whoa! Really?
See, Beatrice?

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,171
- What'd you find?
- A skeleton!

161
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,725
We're digging our own ...

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,261
I-I-I was wrong.
I was wrong all along.

163
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,763
I-I don't know how to get us home.

164
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,598
Use your little feet to pick our locks!

165
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,435
- O-ho! Now you want my help?
- I don't want your help.

166
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,572
Yes, I want your help!

167
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,775
- Beatrice, serio...
- Your time is up!

168
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,748
Have the holes been dug?

169
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,550
- Uh... Yeah.
- Splendid!

170
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,785
- Well, then ...
- But, no.

171
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,353
- No?
- Uh...

172
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,322
Psst!

173
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,691
- Keep stalling.
- Right.

174
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,610
Yeah, uh, you know, we
were digging, and there

175
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,288
were too many rocks.
You guys don't like rocks, right?

176
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:10,298
I don't think we do.

177
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,266
- No, we don't like rocks.
- I don't think so.

178
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,602
See?
So we were like, "we should

179
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,038
- get rid of these rocks."
- Well, that's a good idea.

180
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:18,806
Right? Yeah.

181
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,175
So, we were getting rid
of the rocks and ... huh?

182
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,044
Huh? What?
They left me.

183
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:26,724
- So, what happened to the rocks?
- Uh, the rocks.

184
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,784
Yeah, they ...
they were, um, you know ...

185
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:33,705
they ... they ... they got in
the way of all the ...

186
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:38,042
well, the dirt, you know, and...
W-Whoa! Ohh!

187
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,962
- Welcome back, Larry.
- He looks exactly the same.

188
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:44,715
- What in the...
- Whooooop! Ooh!

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,668
Yeah, Larry! Whoo!

190
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:54,592
- Edward, this one's for you!
- They're all skeletons.

191
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,078
Thanks for digging up
the life of the party.

192
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:01,382
What a wonderful harvest.
And what about you?

193
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:04,051
- You sure you want to leave?
- Me? Yes?

194
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:07,321
Oh, well.
You'll join us someday.

195
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,823
- Uh...
- Psst!

196
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:13,277
- Why are you still here?
- What do you mean? You guys left me!

197
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,030
- Oh.
- Come on.

198
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,868
- Oh. Are they chasing us?
- Both: No.

199
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,371
I-I thought you guys ...

200
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:27,141
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

201
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,877
I guess we're even now, huh?
You're not honor-bound

202
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:31,078
to help us anymore.

203
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:33,214
I wish.
But you weren't actually in

204
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,650
- any danger with those weirdos.
- Oh, yeah!

205
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,152
Then you still have to help us get home.

206
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,755
I got it! I wish
Wirt Jr. had fingernails

207
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:42,857
so he could play the guitar better.

208
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,228
So... Yeah, I'll bring you
to Adelaide. I mean, that's

209
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,830
- where I'm going anyway.
- Why are you going

210
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,832
- to Adelaide's?
- I guess, in some ways, I'm

211
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,834
- trying to get home, too.
- That's vague.

212
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,342
<i>- What does that mean?
- I don't have to tell you anything.</i>

213
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,705
<i>Well, I sure hope Adelaide is</i>

214
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,874
<i>more helpful than that woodsman was.</i>

215
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:03,160
<i>I think his directions
were... not very good.</i>

216
