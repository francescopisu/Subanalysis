00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,444
<i>* Don't know who she is or *</i>

00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,580
<i>* how she is or when,
what, why she is *</i>

5
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:27,550

she is where we will go *

00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:30,219
* to Adelaide, to Adelaide *

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,805
* come on and join *

00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:34,306
<i>- # the Adelaide parade #
- No.</i>

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,993
* Adelaide, to Adelaide *

10
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,595
* let's go to Adelaide's house *

11
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,881
I need to fix that last part,

12
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,518
but that's the idea.
So, Beatrice, you sing

13
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,520
the high part.
Wirt, you sing the really

14
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,605
- high part.
- What?

15
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,689
- Oh.
- And ...

16
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,975
<i>Nobody is singing anything anymore.</i>

17
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,028
- And, Wirt, keep moving.
- But I-I have to ... ugh.

18
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:59,102
- All right.
- But we have to do something fun.

19
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,649
You know, we really don't.

20
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,285
We can just keep walking
silently, you know?

21
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,988
And ... ugh.
Wirt, let's go. Come on.

22
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,873
- Sorry, sorry.
- But shouldn't we ...

23
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,635
Greg, don't you want to be
more like your brother ...

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,578
- just always doing what you're told...
- Huh?

25
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,944
...just a pathetic pushover
who relies on others

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,965
- to make all his decisions?
- Hey! What?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,001
- I'm not a pushover.
- Hold on, Wirt.

28
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:21,336
- Let me get to my point.
- Fine.

29
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:24,590
See, Greg?
No willpower whatsoever.

30
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,863
- Hrmph!
- You need to be more like that.

31
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:30,929
- But that doesn't really sound that fun.
- The world is a miserable

32
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,764
place, Greg. Life isn't fun.

33
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,819
- Then I'll do what I need to do, I guess.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,688
We'll just focus on getting you
guys to Adelaide's so I can wash

35
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:42,491
my hands of this whole affair,
and if you could pick up

36
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:45,694
the pace a bit, that'd be great, okay?

37
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,779
Okay? Hey, where's Greg.

38
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:50,616
Oh.
Uh, wondered off, I guess.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,402
- Cheese and crackers!
- We need to do our part

40
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,637
to make the world a better place!

41
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,372
Yeah.

42
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,790
Huh? Whoa!

43
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,545
School?!

44
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:06,381
Not today.

45
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:07,966
Greg!

46
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:11,970
Greg! Greg?

47
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,555
Oh.

48
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,438
- Greg?
- Excuse me?

49
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,478
Please, take your seat,

50
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,896
children. You're late.

51
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,450
You know the rules ... "once the
bell has run, class has begun."

52
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:26,785
Oh, sorry, everybody. Sorry.

53
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,238
No, he doesn't have a brain.
He can't learn anything.

54
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,290
Let's go, Wirt. Come on.
 Here, boy.

55
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,825
What? Did you say something?
I can't hear you because I'm too

56
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,460
- busy doing what I'm told.
- What?

57
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,745
What are you ...

58
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:38,413
- No, no. Let's go.
- Oh, no.

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,965
See, I'm a pushover, remember?

60
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,551
- I have to do what she tells me to do.
- Ohh.

61
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:45,337
Wirt, your brother could
be in trouble somewhere.

62
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:55,430
<i>Yeah!</i>

63
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:57,232
Bluebird's have a short life span.

64
00:02:57,267 --> 00:03:00,308
You two are literally killing me
every moment I'm forced

65
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,570
- to spend with you.
- Oh.

66
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:05,274
Young man, I will not
stand for such nonsense

67
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,442
in my classroom. I got
enough nonsense from that

68
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:10,973
no good, two-timing,
low-down handsome man of mine.

69
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,365
Oh, Jimmy Brown, why did you

70
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,585
have to leave me so?
And now, with my father

71
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,455
threatening to close the school
and that wild gorilla

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,375
on the loose, why, Jimmy, I
just have one thing to say...

73
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,796
* "A" is for the apple
that he gave to me *

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,591
* but I found a worm inside *

75
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:33,302
* "B" is for beloved that I... *

76
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,304
Ouf.
That lady's got some baggage.

77
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:36,939
What's that?

78
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:41,643
- Young man, go to the dunce box.
- Oh. Sure, okay.

79
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:42,894
- No, no.
- Sure.

80
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,780
No, no.

81
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:47,282
- Aw.
- Now, where were we?

82
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:48,817
Oh, yes.

83
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:52,037
* "G" is for the gentleman
I thought he was *

84
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,723
* when he first said hi *

85
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:58,844
So, my theory is hot dogs
are not actually dogs,

86
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:02,965
regardless of what they
teach you in school.

87
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,500
But you guys don't go to school, huh?

88
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:09,221
I'm gonna stick with you guys.

89
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,556
Hey, I got an idea.

90
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,947
Let's play "two old cat."

91
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:16,311
Do you guys know how to play
"two old cat"?

92
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:21,767
It's fun. I'll show you.
Here we go.

93
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,404
Here's one old cat.

94
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,773
You found another one!

95
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:31,860
Wait. No.
I think that cat is too old.

96
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,578
- Rowr.
- Sorry, kitty.

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,164
We'll have to find another old cat.

98
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,002
Hey, Jeffrey, I think
there's one behind you!

99
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,457
Gorilla! Run!

100
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,677
# And "Y," yes, why is the

101
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:53,265
question that's on my mind #
# oh, why? #

102
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,467
- Hey, dunce. This is dreadful!
- Good.

103
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,552
I'm glad you feel that way.

104
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,521
* I remember like ... *

105
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:01,890
- Huh?
- Gorilla!

106
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,776
Mealtime already?

107
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:07,696
Well, come along children.

108
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:19,347
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,363
We don't want to be late

110
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:24,332
for mealtime.
My father will be visiting today,

111
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,223
and we'll need to
be on our best behavior.

112
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,884
Quick! In here!

113
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,924
Oh, boy! Mealtime!

114
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:39,795
This is way better than
being chased by a gorilla.

115
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:46,334
Aw, what's the matter?

116
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,670
Mm. Kind of bland.

117
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:56,278
- Hey, nobody ordered you to eat yet.
- Yeah, but... Mm.

118
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,613
Hmm.

119
00:05:58,714 --> 00:05:59,815
Ohh.

120
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,953
Hey! I know what to do!
Here, Miss Langtree.

121
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:07,147
Play something like this.

122
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:11,683
Oh, like this?

123
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,929
Mm... good enough.

124
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,634
* oh, potatoes and molasses *

125
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:22,938
* if you want some, oh, just ask us *

126
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:26,308
* they're warm and soft
like puppies and socks *

127
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:29,311
* filled with cream
and candy rocks *

128
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,939
* oh, potatoes and molasses *

129
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,534
* they're so much sweeter than
algebra class *

130
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,536
* if your stomach is grumblin' *

131
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,304
* and your mouth starts mumblin' *

132
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:40,989
* there's only one thing to keep *

133
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,882
* your brain from crumblin' *

134
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,994
* oh, potatoes and molasses *

135
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:49,464
* if you can't see 'em
put on your glasses *

136
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,667
* they're shiny and large
like a fisherman's barge *

137
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:55,720
* you know you eat enough
when you start seeing stars *

138
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:59,374
* oh, potatoes and molasses *

139
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,278
* it's the only thing
left on your task list *

140
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,398
* they're short and stout, *

141
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,599
* They'll make everyone shout *
* for potatoes *

142
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:11,128
* and molasses *

143
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:16,191
- # for potatoes and ... #
- That's enough!

144
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:21,544
- Father.
- Is this what I've been paying for?!

145
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,667
- Hey, we just wanted to have a little fun.
- I didn't invest in this

146
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,920
school for fun.
I thought we were trying to do

147
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:33,875
important work here, teaching
animals to count and spell.

148
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,759
We are! Oh, please, father,
don't close the school.

149
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:40,477
- It won't happen again.
- I should say it won't.

150
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,575
- This...
- Pbht!

151
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,418
...this...

152
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,856
...and this are all coming
with me. Now send them to bed!

153
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,809
You heard father.
Off to bed with you.

154
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,525
Mm.

155
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,243
I just wanted to have fun,

156
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:11,279
change the world, and
make it a better place.

157
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,615
But I just made everything worse.

158
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,485
Okay, Wirt, I'll admit it ...

159
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,621
you seem like a
pushover, but you're not.

160
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,289
- Oh?
- Deep down in your heart,

161
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,675
you're a stubborn jerk. When
are you gonna give this up?

162
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,760
Maybe never.
Maybe I'll never give this up.

163
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:27,896
Hmm. Yeah!

164
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:31,316
Wirt's right ... never
give up! Come on, Wirt.

165
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:34,519
- Let's go save the day.
- Okay, if you say so.

166
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,321
Come on.

167
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,991
So, what's the plan, Greg?

168
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:43,278
Plan?
Ohh. I don't know.

169
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:46,381
Ohh!
Who would've thought making a

170
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,501
primer school for
animals was a bad idea?

171
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:54,256
My life savings, my home ...
everything I had went into that

172
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,260
dear, dear school. And now
I'm forced to sell these

173
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,929
instruments just to keep it open.

174
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:03,815
All the while that loathsome Jimmy Brown

175
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,668
is off gallivanting who knows where!

176
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:10,805
Not to mention that wild
gorilla on the loose.

177
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,311
If only something would
go right for a change.

178
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,148
Okay, I think he's asleep.

179
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:23,401
<i>- Let's go steal his stuff.
- What?</i>

180
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,826
The instruments!

181
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:36,136
They've been stolen!
Who would do such a thing?!

182
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,181
Huh?

183
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,588
<i>- Here you go.
- Oh, here you go, sonny.</i>

184
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:46,624
What is this?

185
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,543
It's a benefit
concert for the school.

186
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:52,764
Ah, isn't it grand ... all
these fine people giving out

187
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:55,049
of the goodness of their hearts?

188
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:57,802
Not like my Jimmy Brown.

189
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:02,056
- Ohh, here we go.
- All he ever did was steal

190
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,609
- my heart away.
- Gorilla!

191
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:09,113
Young man, do something!

192
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:11,733
Uh...

193
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:14,452
Whoa!

194
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:20,675
- Finally.
- Jimmy?

195
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:23,912
That's right, darlin'.
I was the gorilla.

196
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:27,081
- But why did you do it?
- Got a job in the circus so's

197
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,050
I could finally buy
ya that wedding ring.

198
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:32,220
But when I got stuck in the
dang suit, everybody was too

199
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:35,640
- doggone scared to help me out.
- Aw, Jimmy.

200
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,299
- Oh!
- Darlin'.

201
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,847
I guess the world really is

202
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:46,768
as sweet as potatoes and molasses.

203
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,272
* oh, potatoes and molasses *

204
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,574
* if you want some... *

205
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:55,543
So, want me to tell Greg
it's time to get going?

206
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,165
Nah, let him have his fun.

207
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,573
* filled with cream
and candy and rocks *

208
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:02,434
- Hey, Wirt.
- Yeah?

209
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:05,687
- Tie your shoe.
- Hmm? Oh. Mm. Okay.

210
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:06,688
* ...algebra class *

211
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,558
* if your stomach is grumblin'
and your mouth... *

212
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,659
