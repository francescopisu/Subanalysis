1
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:03,783
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,619
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

3
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:11,499
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go, like, every few minutes.

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:17,547
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

5
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,675
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

6
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:21,885
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,012
If you think that I didn't say goodbye...

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,599
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

9
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,559
It's because you mean more to me.

10
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,644
- Rash!
- What?

11
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:57,253
- Hey.
- Ha, ha.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,673
Shh. Go back to sleep.
I have to go home.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,469
Oh, God. This was amazing.

14
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,430
It really was.

15
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,517
You've learned some new moves.

16
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:15,897
Yeah, well, uh, this guy at work gave me
Sex for Dummies as a joke.

17
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,565
- Ah.
- Who's laughing now?

18
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,067
I am.

19
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,288
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

20
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:16,666
Okay. Good.

21
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,376
Next time, can I say "breathe"?

22
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:21,588
No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
and it scared her.

23
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,341
Can I get you anything?
Want more ice chips?

24
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,511
- No, I'm okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

25
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:33,182
- Where you going?
- To use the bathroom.

26
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,769
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?

27
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,814
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...

28
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,816
...that I am not comfortable with.

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,154
What kind of social situation
are you comfortable with?

30
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:50,617
It's just that we've never spent any time,
you know, alone together.

31
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:54,787
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.

32
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,122
Okay.

33
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,675
So, uh, any plans for the summer?

34
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,804
I don't know. Maybe church camp.

35
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,434
Ha...

36
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:19,187
May not want to mention this.

37
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,359
So you ever wonder which is worse?

38
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,655
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?

39
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,867
- What?
- Oh, it's just interesting.

40
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:37,747
You know, because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.

41
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,879
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.

42
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:47,882
I mean, who knows?

43
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,551
Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.

44
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,140
Like this.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,815
- Come in.
- Morning.

46
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,733
- Hey.
- What's that?

47
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,404
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.

48
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,824
- That's a baby chick and duck.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,910
And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.

50
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:19,163
- I did not see that coming.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

51
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,250
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.

52
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,585
And when they're old,
they can go to that farm...

53
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,630
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.

54
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,425
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,762
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- That is the rule though.

56
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,185
- Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
- What?

57
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:44,856
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.

58
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:47,942
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

59
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:50,778
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
was gonna be a girl.

60
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:53,156
Have you seen him throw a ball'?

61
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,619
- Is Rachel here?
- Uh, I think she's still asleep.

62
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,038
Hey, hey, hey. How did it go
with you guys last night?

63
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,374
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

64
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:06,627
We, uh...
You know, we worked things out.

65
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,631
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?

66
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:13,301
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

67
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:17,305
Uh, but I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it.

68
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,391
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?

69
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,478
- I know, it's pretty great.
- So, what does that mean?

70
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:26,314
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.

71
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:29,817
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?

72
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,028
I don't know.

73
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,823
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.

74
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,120
When I was holding her,
I mean, I never wanted to let her go.

75
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,207
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.

76
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,666
Yay!
- Shh!

77
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,418
Yay!

78
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,713
So is she still going to Paris?

79
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.

80
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:57,720
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.

81
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,015
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...

82
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:03,017
...in the world again.

83
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:06,312
Oh. I feel like I'm in a musical.

84
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,818
When the sun comes up
Bright and beamin'

85
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,027
And the moon comes

86
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,905
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.

87
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:18,866
- Hey.
- Hi.

88
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:22,119
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

89
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,748
- Good.
- I'll bet you did.

90
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,502
Uh, would you guys mind
giving us a minute?

91
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,963
Sure. Yeah. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.

92
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,131
Chick and the duck'? Didn't they die...?

93
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:40,555
Dive. Yeah, they dove.
Headfirst into fun on the farm.

94
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:48,938
O

95
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,986
- Morning.
- You too.

96
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:58,990
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.

97
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,325
I woke up today
with the biggest smile on my face.

98
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,578
I know, me too. It was...

99
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:07,498
You know, it was like one of those things
you think is never gonna happen.

100
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,419
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.

101
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,171
I know. It was just...

102
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,801
It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.

103
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:30,146
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!

104
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:32,148
- Is it really that bad?
- Uh-huh.

105
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:36,277
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
and see which is worse.

106
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,781
The baby's head is crowning.

107
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:45,536
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful
top of a head I have ever seen.

108
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:50,082
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.

109
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,210
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.

110
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,923
- It's the miracle of life.
- All right.

111
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:02,303
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

112
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:05,139
Start pushing. Here we go.

113
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,350
Here come the shoulders.

114
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,233
It's a boy.

115
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:19,153
- Is he okay?
- He's just fine.

116
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:21,155
You did it.

117
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:22,949
It's a baby.

118
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:28,913
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

119
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,126
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.

120
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,799
Well, that's spongy.

121
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,260
Oh...

122
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:46,222
Hey, handsome.

123
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:52,269
I'll love you so much that no woman
is ever gonna be good enough for you.

124
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:57,066
- We are so lucky.
- I know.

125
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:00,403
He has your eyes.

126
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:05,449
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.

127
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,536
- We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
- Okay.

128
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:12,790
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

129
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,044
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

130
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,631
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

131
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:25,594
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.

132
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?

133
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,315
The next baby should be
along in a minute.

134
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,235
We only ordered one.

135
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:45,281
- You know it's twins, right?
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,909
These are the faces
of two people in the know.

137
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:58,461
I can't believe you didn't know its twins.
This has never happened before.

138
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:02,423
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.

139
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,091
Did you know it was twins?

140
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,802
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork
we got from the clinic.

141
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:10,097
- Did anybody tell you?
- I don't think so.

142
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,309
Although, they did mention something
about two heartbeats...

143
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:15,519
...but I thought that was just mine
and the baby's.

144
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,354
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."

145
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,941
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
because I'm having a baby."

146
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:25,321
- This is unbelievable.
- Twins actually run in my family.

147
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,239
Interesting.

148
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,659
Can I see you for a second?

149
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,331
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"

150
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:39,168
Twins!

151
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:43,631
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?

152
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,969
What do you say we keep one and then
just have an option on the other one?

153
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,764
- We can't split them up.
- Why not?

154
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,100
We could give each of them
half a medallion.

155
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,894
And then years later,
they'll find each other...

156
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:03,901
...and be reunited. I mean,
that's a great day for everybody.

157
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:07,154
Okay. What if the person who adopts
the other one is horrible?

158
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,324
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?

159
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,869
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.

160
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:17,081
Monica, we are not ready
to have two babies.

161
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:20,668
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.

162
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:24,046
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.

163
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:27,925
I don't care if the entire cast
of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.

164
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,972
We are taking them home
because they are our children.

165
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,267
Okay. Shh.

166
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:38,352
- Okay!
- Okay!

167
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,396
Okay.

168
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,691
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.

169
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,943
Start pushing again now.

170
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:51,031
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?

171
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,825
Yeah.

172
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,245
Well, now we have one of each.

173
00:11:57,746 --> 00:12:00,499
And that's enough.

174
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:06,672
And then she said it was the perfect way
to say goodbye.

175
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:08,757
Oh, my God.

176
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,384
What did you say?

177
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:15,097
- Nothing. What do you say to that?
- Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel.

178
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,725
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.

179
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,186
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

180
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,190
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.

181
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,819
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
even wanna get back together.

182
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:33,073
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.

183
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,659
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!

184
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:40,456
Oh, okay, this is the part of the musical
where there'd be a good, convincing song.

185
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:43,500
Don't take no for an answer

186
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:47,504
Don't let love fly away

187
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:51,300
- Hi.
- Can't a girl finish a song around here?

188
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,261
- Hey.
- Hi. So I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

189
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,347
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?

190
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,058
No, we decided that
I'd go ahead and set up first...

191
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,310
...then my mom would bring Emma
to Paris on Sunday.

192
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:03,812
Wow. Eight-hour flight with a baby.
Good luck, Mom.

193
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,858
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mom
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.

194
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:14,823
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.

195
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,201
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?

196
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:19,036
Could you get me a muffin?

197
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,000
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

198
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:31,757
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.

199
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,634
I love you.

200
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,765
Now, I don't know if that changes
your plans at all.

201
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:44,395
But I thought you should know.

202
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,690
Gunther.

203
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:54,280
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.

204
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:59,702
But I do. And when I'm
in a café having coffee...

205
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:03,372
...or I see a man with hair
brighter than the sun...

206
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,875
...I'll think of you.

207
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,718
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

208
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,723
Oh, my God!

209
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,934
Unbelievable.

210
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,979
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!

211
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,701
Do you think they recognize
each other from in there?

212
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,912
Maybe. Unless they're like people
who've lived in apartments...

213
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,916
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...

214
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,877
...and they meet.

215
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,005
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.

216
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,341
There's something
that we wanted to tell you.

217
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,846
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.

218
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,308
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!

219
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,645
Son of a gun, it is.

220
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,233
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

221
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:19,073
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.

222
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,283
Even Chandler.

223
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,329
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.

224
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:26,914
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

225
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,541
Have fun at church camp.

226
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,051
- Look at these little bunnies.
- I know.

227
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,428
You ready to trade?

228
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,390
_Qkay-
_Qkay-

229
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,600
Okay. Let's see.

230
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:58,153
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.

231
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:05,828
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.

232
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:08,831
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?

233
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:12,084
No, I sat in the paint.

234
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,130
- Hey.
- So did you talk to Rachel?

235
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:19,341
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

236
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,885
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.

237
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:25,097
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.

238
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,641
How can you compare
yourself to Gunther?

239
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,436
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.

240
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:36,442
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.

241
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,487
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.

242
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,865
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I mean, sometimes...

243
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,868
- Uh, Joe.
- Damn it!

244
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,704
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.

245
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:51,248
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.

246
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:55,669
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.

247
00:16:55,836 --> 00:17:01,341
Do you know how many hot guys there
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.

248
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:05,804
- Hey.
- Hey.

249
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:08,474
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,393
If I had more time to work on it,
it'd be better, but...

251
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,566
- Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
- Honey, that's gorgeous.

252
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:21,153
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.

253
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:26,158
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!

254
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,994
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.

255
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:32,706
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.

256
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:36,543
- Apparently, there's some big surprise.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?

257
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,964
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.

258
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:49,556
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.

259
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,435
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

260
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,103
Hey.

261
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,901
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?

262
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,783
- Oh, my God!
- How did this...?

263
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,953
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?

264
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:15,082
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my... They are so cute.

265
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:20,754
- Now, what kinds are they?
- This is a boy. And that's a girl.

266
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,464
Her name is Erica.

267
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,301
Hey, that pregnant girl's name
was Erica.

268
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,639
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.

269
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,976
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.

270
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:38,480
- He's gonna be so happy.
- Jack Bing. I love that.

271
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:42,776
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.

272
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:46,113
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."

273
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, my gosh.

274
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,289
- So beautiful.
- I want one.

275
00:18:55,455 --> 00:19:00,210
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

276
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,006
Seriously. I mean,
you want to make one of those?

277
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:06,466
- One? How about a whole bunch?
- Really?

278
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:11,847
Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
and we could be like the von Trapp family.

279
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:15,142
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.

280
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:20,230
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.

281
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,359
- I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
- Me too.

282
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:29,114
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
to watch you two attempt to handle this.

283
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:34,620
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.

284
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:37,581
- I love you all so much.
- Love you.

285
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,374
- We love you.
- Call us when you get there.

286
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,128
I will. Ross, come here.

287
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,841
I just want you to know...

288
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,511
...last night...

289
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,182
...I'll never forget it.

290
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,893
Neither will I.

291
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,153
All right. Now I really have to go.

292
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,822
Okay, au revoir.

293
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,407
Ugh.

294
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,661
They're gonna really hate me over there.

295
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:20,624
So you just let her go?

296
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,793
Yeah.

297
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:26,588
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?

298
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,883
Yeah. You know, you just...
Look, you gotta...

299
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,594
You gotta think about last night
the way she does.

300
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,055
Okay? You know, maybe...

301
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:40,018
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

302
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:44,356
- But now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?

303
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:46,775
Maybe it is better this way.

304
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:51,071
I mean, now... Now you can move on.

305
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,949
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.

306
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,993
Maybe now that you're
on different continents...

307
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,287
- Right?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,253
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.

309
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,673
You can finally get over her.

310
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,929
Yeah, that's true.

311
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,724
Except.

312
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:23,645
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?

313
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:26,815
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Really?

314
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:29,484
- Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
- Yeah, you are!

315
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,114
Wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!

316
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,283
- My coat.
- This is so cool!

317
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,619
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!

318
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:42,330
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- I don't know.

319
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:47,085
But even if she shoots me down,
at least I won't spend my life wondering...

320
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,796
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?

321
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:54,259
You didn't bring one! My cab's
downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.

322
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,886
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

323
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:57,637
Good luck!

324
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:11,401
- There's no seat belts!
- That's okay. If we hit anything...

325
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:16,656
...the engine will explode,
so it's better if you're thrown from the car.

326
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:19,910
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!

327
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:22,913
- Hey!
- 80th and East End.
