388
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,105
...but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

389
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,609
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

390
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,613
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

391
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,825
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

392
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,538
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

393
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,164
If the rain stops.

394
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,504
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

395
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,510
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

396
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,055
- I have a ring.
- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

397
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,517
But, Phoebe...

398
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,602
...will you marry me?

399
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,775
No.

400
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,487
Ha-ha.

401
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:22,329
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

402
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,748
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

403
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:30,129
- That we had a future.
- We can have any future you want.

404
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,388
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

405
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,808
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

406
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,770
Just so I know,
if I had asked first?

407
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:52,651
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

408
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,613
Please, you don't have to explain.

409
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,866
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

410
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:04,038
...things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

411
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,915
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

412
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,335
It was a good trip.

413
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,383
- Is it okay if I hug you now?
- Oh, yes.

414
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,306
Because of our meddling! All right?

415
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,736
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

416
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,738
Oh, I know.

417
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:44,495
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

418
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:50,125
- The sun is out!
- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

419
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,086
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

420
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:56,590
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.
- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

421
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,926
- No!
- Damn it!

422
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,388
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

423
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:13,107
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

424
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:19,196
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

425
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,117
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

426
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,787
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

427
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,834
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

428
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,211
Giganotosaurus.

429
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,424
- Argentinosaurus."
- Not to mention Coldsaurus.

430
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,514
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

431
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,349
Their heads are already too big.

432
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,228
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

433
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,109
Really?

434
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,489
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

435
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:07,453
...that Homo ergaster is thought to be a
separate species from Homo erectus..."

436
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,293
- What?
- He said "erectus."

437
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,589
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he really said it.

438
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,634
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

439
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:27,598
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of Homo erectus..."

440
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,810
Erectus?

441
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,687
- Homo.
- Right.

442
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,779
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

443
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,697
Thank you.

444
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,914
- Really great.
- Thanks, guys.

445
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,708
I thought it was wonderful.

446
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,377
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

447
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:03,592
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and...

448
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,809
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

449
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,063
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

450
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,816
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

451
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,403
- Take it easy.
- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

452
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,198
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

453
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,826
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

454
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,411
Oh.

455
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,372
I'm back.

456
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,126
Okay. Well, excuse me?

457
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,419
Hey.

458
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,630
- Well?
- You were incredible.

459
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,840
You blew them away.

460
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,635
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

461
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,764
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

462
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,558
- I was not.
- No, it's okay.

463
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,686
It made me feel like a rock star.

464
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,106
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

465
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,401
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

466
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,740
Look, I took it too far.

467
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,083
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

468
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,794
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

469
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,172
...all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

470
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,594
Not you guys.

471
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,680
You've got it going on.

472
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,769
- What will we do today?
- They have a game room downstairs.

473
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,479
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

474
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,857
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

475
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,109
- Let's play.
- I don't think so.

476
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,654
- Why not?
- You know how competitive you get.

477
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,949
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

478
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,495
- I'm not always that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

479
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,081
What happened when we played
last time?

480
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,208
I punched you.

481
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,296
- And?
- Phoebe.

482
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,841
- And?
- I clunked your heads together.

483
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,112
- There you are.
- Hey. Listen.

484
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,658
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

485
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,536
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

486
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,789
...he chases you.

487
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,626
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

488
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,002
Oh.

489
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,588
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

490
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,799
I'd do it alone, but, uh...

491
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,260
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

492
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,347
You know, I feel so bad.

493
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,392
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night...

494
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,062
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

495
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,941
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

496
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,276
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

497
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,322
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

498
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,453
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?
- Yeah.

499
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,122
A little bit, yeah.

500
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,004
I think we need to talk.

501
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,174
Yeah, I think we do.

502
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,470
About what?

503
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,601
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
- All right.

504
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,272
- I'll play if we don't keep score.
- Well, then how do we know who wins?

505
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:51,111
- Nobody wins.
- So we're just four losers. Super.

506
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,906
- Well, I'm not playing with her.
- I'm out.

507
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,700
- I'll play you.
- Okay.

508
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,536
- You don't know what you're doing.
- She gets crazy.

509
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,205
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

510
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,126
I think I'll be all right.

511
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,671
- You want to volley a bit for serve?
- Sure, if you want to.

512
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,302
Ho!

513
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,473
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

514
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,269
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

515
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,064
- You ready to play?
- Hell, yeah.

516
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:33,070
- Did you know this about him?
- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

517
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,073
- Want to make it more interesting?
- How much you thinking?

518
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,075
- Ten bucks a game?
- Make it 50.

519
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,868
- I'll make it 100.
- One thousand...

520
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,620
Okay!

521
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,207
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

522
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,376
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

523
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,172
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

524
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,802
- Monica, you call it.
- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

525
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,429
- Tails.
- Oh, what are the chances?

526
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,311
- Hah! My point!
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

527
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,273
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

528
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,443
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

529
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,949
He was a lawyer.

530
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,120
All the East Coast
is having beautiful weather.

531
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,330
In New York, it's 72 and sunny.

532
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,833
Oh. Weather bitch.

533
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,878
It's open.

534
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,631
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

535
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,136
- What? Is everything okay?
- Charlie and I broke up.

536
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,429
No. Why?

537
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,391
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

538
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,518
That's crazy.

539
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,312
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

540
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,649
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

541
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,153
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

542
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,531
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

543
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,451
- Man, smart people are dull.
- Well, hey!

544
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,953
Okay, Rach.

545
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:12,961
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

546
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,714
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

547
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:21,595
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like... What the hell's my problem?

548
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,804
I just...

549
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:33,440
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

550
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,693
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

551
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,197
- I'm not talking about her.
- Well, then, who?

552
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,824
The waitress I went out with last month?

553
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,578
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no, no.

554
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,122
- Who are you talking about?
- No, I don't...

555
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,791
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so...

556
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,543
- Okay.
- Yeah.

557
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,339
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

558
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,384
- And I'll see you later.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

559
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,621
- You like me?
- Okay.

560
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,916
- Let's not make a big thing about this.
- It's a huge thing!

561
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,335
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

562
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:40,674
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

563
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,426
Musings, if you will.

564
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,264
- Well, for how long?
- Oh, only like a month.

565
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,140
- A month?!
- Well...

566
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:54,813
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

567
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,441
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

568
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,530
- Okay, dial it up a little.
- Oh, you're right. Okay.

569
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,240
- I just have a question.
- Shoot.

570
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,077
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not trying to do anything.

571
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,414
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

572
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,793
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

573
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,714
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

574
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,258
...George!

575
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,011
Who?

576
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,721
- Curious George!
- Oh!

577
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,473
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

578
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,101
- Of course. I remember.
- He had a paper route.

579
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,103
Yeah, he did.

580
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,773
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- No, I know. We're great!

581
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,693
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

582
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,864
Can't it just happen a little bit?

583
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,244
- No! It can't happen at all!
- Why not?

584
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,457
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

585
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,960
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

586
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,422
...and not once did I ever say no.

587
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,054
I couldn't do it to Ross.

588
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,932
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
- I know. I know...

589
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,813
...but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

590
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,692
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,697
I'm sorry too.

592
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,787
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

593
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,581
- Like you said, it's no big deal.
- It's not a big deal.

594
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,708
- No big deal.
- It's so not a big deal.

595
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,086
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.
- Okay, great.

596
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,691
Okay... Oh!

597
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,959
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...
I think that may have missed the table.

598
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,836
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

599
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,129
- Do you?
- Yeah.

600
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,172
- Do you?
- Yeah!

601
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,260
- You really find this attractive on him?
- Oh, yeah.

602
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,389
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

603
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,774
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

604
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,902
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

605
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,697
Knock that dog off her head.

606
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,578
- Oh, damn it!
- I sleep with him!

607
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,166
- Game point.
- Don't get too cocky.

608
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,876
Remember, I won the last one.

609
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,004
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

610
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,090
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

611
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,557
- No! No! No!
- And that's how it's done.

612
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,892
Okey-dokey.

613
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:23,313
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

614
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,148
Everybody goes home a winner.

615
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,108
- Best of three?
- What I'm thinking.

616
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,988
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

617
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,909
- Serve the ball, chump.
- "Serve the ball, chump."

618
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,704
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

619
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,918
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

620
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,546
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

621
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,966
...just nifty.

622
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:59,098
Well, I've kind of got a lot
on my plate right now.

623
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:03,520
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

624
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,233
- Jarvis?
- Oh, you're back.

625
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,488
- This is my wife, Nancy.
- Well, get out!

626
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,908
Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?

627
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,284
Yes, please.

628
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,998
So, what's going on?

629
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,754
Well, Joey and I broke up.

630
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:35,885
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Joey is a great guy...

631
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,388
...but we're just...
We're so different.

632
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,891
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

633
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,561
I knew that was him!

634
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,108
Anyway, I just...
I think it's for the best.

635
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,154
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I guess.

636
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,826
There was...

637
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,915
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

638
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:12,547
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

639
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,718
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

640
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,220
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

641
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,765
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

642
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,020
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?
- Or we could throw you both in now.

643
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,898
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

644
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,735
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

645
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,780
...and most importantly
you will have to catch us first.

646
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,366
Go! Go! Go!

647
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,836
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41.

648
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,758
- Okay, look, enough is enough.
- No.

649
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:01,220
- I just have two more points to beat him.
- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

650
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,722
I mean, please, look at you.

651
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,393
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

652
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,440
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

653
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,276
We missed our dinner reservation,
let's go upstairs...

654
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,279
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

655
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,159
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

656
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,079
You knew this about me
when you married me.

657
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,207
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

658
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,668
Well, this is my sickness!

659
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,546
- What about the obsessive cleaning?
- That's just good sense.

660
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,635
Ow!

661
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,306
- You okay?
- No, honey, I'm okay.

662
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,435
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

663
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,526
Oh, my God. I can't play.

664
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,153
- So you forfeit?
- Mike wins?

665
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,574
I can't believe it. I lost.

666
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,289
- No, you didn't.
- What?

667
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,626
- Because I'm gonna play for you.
- You can't do that.

668
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,130
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

669
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,759
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

670
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,724
- Honey, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

671
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,476
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

672
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,229
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

673
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,814
Because I love you.

674
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,277
But you suck.

675
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,405
You're welcome, sweetheart.

676
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,950
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

677
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,871
- Whoever wins this point, wins.
- Okay.

678
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,546
- Oh, my God. You're good.
- It's like watching porn.

679
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,971
And that's how it's done.

680
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:12,769
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

681
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,645
Well, when did you...?

682
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,691
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

683
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:25,072
- When did you stop sucking?
- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

684
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,949
...to know how good I was.
- Why?

685
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,951
- I don't know.
- Well, this is so great.

686
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,038
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
- That's why.

687
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,674
- They still looking for us?
- Yeah.

688
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,761
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

689
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,222
The herbivores and the carnivores.

690
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,268
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

691
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,312
Oh, look out.

692
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,072
- I don't think they saw us.
- I don't think they did.

693
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:18,459
So I started to tell you
something earlier. Um...

694
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:24,257
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

695
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:29,762
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

696
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,889
...for someone else.

697
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,600
Oh.

698
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,645
And can I ask who?

699
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,898
I think you know.

700
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:47,321
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so...

701
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:10,428
- I'm sorry, we can't.
- All right. All right.

702
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,056
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

703
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,977
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

704
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,567
Or not. I mean...

705
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,397
What?

706
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,907
Oh.
