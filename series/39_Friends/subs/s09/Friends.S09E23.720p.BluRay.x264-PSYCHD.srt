1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,714
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,593
Oh, that's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,138
We're going to a conference
in Barbados. Right?

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,682
- Uh-huh.
- Can you say, "Barbados"?

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,517
Barbados.

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,732
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so
much to me that you guys are coming...

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,401
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,404
Ooh, and I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:35,701
...but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,332
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,628
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

12
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,466
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

13
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,676
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

14
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,054
David'll probably want to hear
a few lectures.

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,264
- Right, because he's a scientist.
- No, no.

16
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,101
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

17
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,062
...he'll die.

18
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,355
Okay, we'd better go. Yeah?

19
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,275
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- All right, let's do it.

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,111
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,739
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,117
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

23
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,681
- Wow, this place is beautiful!
- Look at all these paleontologists!

24
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,060
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

25
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,938
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here!

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,314
I think I've been recognized.

27
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,861
- This happens all the time.
- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

28
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,446
That never happens.

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:41,034
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,873
- Wow. This is very flattering...
- I would love your autograph.

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,835
Well, sure. Um...

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,044
- "Dear?"
- Sarah.

33
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,340
"Sarah. I dig you."

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,470
- "Dr. Ross Geller."
- Oh, thank you so much.

35
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,975
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,229
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.
- Are you a paleontologist?

37
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,941
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,695
You probably recognize me from a
little show called The Days of Our Lives.

39
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:21,575
Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives.
There's no "the."

40
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:30,042
Okay, Ross, boy, you... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

41
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,422
- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
- You don't own a TV?

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,966
What's all your furniture pointed at?

43
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,347
David, can you help me?

44
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,017
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh, certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,732
...and Newton's third law of motion.
- See?

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,361
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

48
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,113
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

49
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,868
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

50
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,662
...or should Mike and I meet you?

51
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,043
Mike? Who's Mike?

52
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,506
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
- That's right!

53
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,842
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

54
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,307
- That's a blast from the past, huh?
- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

55
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,477
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

56
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,438
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,610
- She does?
- Let's get you out of here.

58
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,076
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

59
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,455
I'm so sorry. I just...
I keep thinking about Mike.

60
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,668
I'm crazy about David,
and we're having so much fun together.

61
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,714
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...
That's gonna go away, right?

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,216
- Well, I guess. In time.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,052
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

64
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,516
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

65
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,354
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

66
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,024
I wouldn't read too much into it.

67
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,819
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,822
...that's not a good thing, right?
- Let me stop you there.

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,535
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

70
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,997
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

71
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:37,336
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

72
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,632
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

73
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,636
- Well, you know Phoebe...
- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

74
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,766
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

75
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,771
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
- Oh, because his penis was too big.

76
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,778
I'm sorry.
That's the kind of thing I do.

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,865
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,951
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,456
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

80
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,957
What?

81
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,585
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

82
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,713
- No, I didn't mean now.
- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,008
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

84
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,844
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but..."

85
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,390
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
- Well, you're welcome.

86
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,183
Glad I could help.

87
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,021
- How do you think I should propose?
- I'm pretending to read here.

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,773
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,196
Yeah. How you doing?

90
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,657
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

91
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,493
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

92
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:57,082
Ha, ha, I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

93
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,669
You really should have been
more clear about that.

94
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,801
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

95
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,595
Oh, uh, uh, Britney Spears!

96
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,723
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

97
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,686
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
- Oh, my God!

98
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,980
- I know!
- Did you talk to him?

99
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,816
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

100
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,903
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

101
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,240
- You ready to go?
- You're gonna go now?

102
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,202
- I thought we could hang out.
- I can't. I have seminars all day.

103
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,288
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

104
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,502
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? It'll be romantic.

105
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,337
Will you wear a thong?

106
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,798
I will if you will.

107
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,178
You got yourself a very weird deal.

108
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,849
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

109
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,603
- So you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

110
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,648
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

111
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,567
Joe, have you looked outside?

112
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,153
No. Why?

113
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,450
- Oh, man.
- There's an indoor pool.

114
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,951
- You could swim there.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,747
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

116
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,671
That "Mike" was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

117
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,426
...with Phoebe and David.
- I do. Want a hint, huh?

118
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,640
I do.

119
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,060
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

120
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,188
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

121
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:48,401
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
- What? Why?

122
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,905
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

123
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,407
...and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

124
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,952
Chandler, we have talked about this.

125
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,871
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

126
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,209
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

127
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,503
I did! A penis one!

128
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,756
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

129
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,008
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

130
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:16,555
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

131
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,225
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

132
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,395
...and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

133
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,356
Man, that's some bad advice.

134
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,366
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

135
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,078
- What's going on?
- Everything is upside-down here.

136
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:45,875
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

137
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,629
I don't want to alarm anybody...

138
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:53,300
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

139
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,595
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

140
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,015
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

141
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,185
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

142
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,479
I'll show you guys where to check in.

143
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,733
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

144
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,446
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

145
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,490
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

146
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,411
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

147
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,998
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

148
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,208
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

149
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:32,005
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

150
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,259
- Not Joey.
- Not Joey. No.

151
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:41,264
- I was just lusting after Chandler.
- Yeah, right.

152
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:48,355
So I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

153
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,231
Tonight?

154
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,610
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

155
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,821
Oh, there it is.

156
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,532
Yes, well, being a failed scientist...

157
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,951
...doesn't pay quite as well
as you might think.

158
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,538
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

159
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,250
And the clarity is quite poor.

160
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,671
Nice.

161
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,258
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay.

162
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,302
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

163
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,514
See what happens
when you give people advice?

164
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,184
- Well, I hope you told him not to.
- That would be advice!

165
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,270
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

166
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,900
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

167
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,571
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you leaving the Supremes?

168
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:50,375
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

169
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,627
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

170
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,463
Wow, really?

171
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,383
That's fantastic!

172
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,262
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

173
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,515
- What about Mike?
- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

174
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,892
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

175
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,395
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

176
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,897
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

177
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,237
You know? It's every girl's dream.

178
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,907
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

179
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,370
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike... David!

180
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,416
David! I love David.

181
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,335
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

182
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,428
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

183
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,475
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century."

184
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,519
It's great.

185
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,521
You'll be the hit
of the conference.

186
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,231
It'll be even better tomorrow...

187
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,026
...because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

188
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,154
...checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

189
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,368
- Hey, guys.
- The chocolates aren't here.

190
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,579
Damn it!

191
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,081
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

192
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,752
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

193
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,047
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

194
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,049
What? May I?

195
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:28,932
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

196
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,768
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

197
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,980
- The wet season is June to December.
- It's not the time, Charlie.

198
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,941
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

199
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,152
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

200
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,491
Secret teapot.

201
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,285
Your computer. I don't know what...
Everything's gone.

202
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,371
- What do you mean?
- Must be a virus.

203
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,790
I think it erased your hard drive.

204
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,501
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

205
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,420
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

206
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,675
- Why? Why would you open it?
- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

207
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,469
- What did it say?
- "Nude..."

208
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,598
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

209
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,102
- I'm so sorry.
- What am I gonna do?

210
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,729
- My speech is gone!
- It's not gone.

211
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,649
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

212
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,734
No, I don't!

213
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,863
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

214
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,293
- It's really gone?
- Yep.

215
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,170
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

216
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,340
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

217
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,718
- I just feel awful.
- Yeah, you should.

218
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:52,557
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova?
She's never even won a major tournament.

219
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,436
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

220
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,690
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

221
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,902
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

222
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,487
Get out.

223
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,909
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

224
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,952
- What do you do?
- I usually go...

225
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,288
...play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

226
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,207
I can't believe this is happening.

227
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,002
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

228
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,589
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

229
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,966
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

230
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,887
I don't think your monologue from
Star Wars is gonna help me right now.

231
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,599
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

232
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,437
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.
- What, you really think we can do that?

233
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,774
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

234
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,109
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

235
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,403
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

236
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,158
All right. Okay, let's do it.

237
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:57,330
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

238
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,542
And then I move on
to what is clearly the defining moment...

239
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,921
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

240
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,926
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

241
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,555
Ooh, ooh. Any chance any of this
happened in a galaxy far, far away?

242
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,816
- Hello?
- Okay, Mike?

243
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,902
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

244
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,697
So get over your
I-never-wanna-get-married thing...

245
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,490
...and step up!

246
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,534
Who is this?

247
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,327
This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.

248
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,746
Listen. Phoebe is back with David.

249
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,082
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,085
...but I know she really wants to be
with you.

251
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,381
He's gonna propose?

252
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,552
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

253
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,056
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

254
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,059
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

255
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,979
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

256
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,567
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

257
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,028
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

258
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,821
What do you do in the humidity?

259
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,074
Damn it!

260
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,665
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Aw, I hope you're happy too, honey.

261
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,001
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

262
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,464
- That's what happens when you meddle.
- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

263
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,799
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

264
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,761
- There's no chance that will work?
- No, I called.

265
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,014
- It's not gonna happen.
- Meddler! Meddler!

266
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,475
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

267
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,269
...then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

268
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,522
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

269
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,400
...the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

270
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,028
This vacation sucks!

271
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,620
- I'm so bored.
- Mm.

272
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,290
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

273
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,168
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

274
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,295
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

275
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,632
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

276
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

277
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,015
You feel like going to a convention?

278
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,894
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.
- I know we're not...

279
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,315
...but Frank Madaio and Eva...

280
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,240
- Kate Miller.
- Kate Miller it is.

281
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,784
- Okay.
- Oh, good...

282
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,830
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

283
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,667
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

284
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,341
Thank you.

285
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,347
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

286
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,599
...into the 21 st century.

287
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,560
Well, yeah. That's it?

288
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,604
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. We did it.

289
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,151
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

290
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,822
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

291
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,743
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

292
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,207
That's a pretty necklace.

293
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,128
Thank you.

294
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,673
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

295
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,927
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

296
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,471
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

297
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,435
Oh, my God, I love you.

298
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,190
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

299
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,775
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

300
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,445
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

301
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,405
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,699
You've been married more than once?

303
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,701
No.

304
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,871
Mm.

305
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,539
So why'd you break up?

306
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,835
Oh, it was...

307
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,424
It's complicated, you know?
She was, uh...

308
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,009
...gay.

309
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,427
Oh, my God.

310
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,137
This is so cool!

311
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,515
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

312
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,936
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

313
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,063
Hey! High-five!

314
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,609
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

315
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,154
My fiancé was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

316
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,284
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

317
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,578
She didn't get any fitter.

318
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,748
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
- I know.

319
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,794
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

320
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,713
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

321
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,757
- I know.
- And then...

322
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,551
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

323
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,471
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

324
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,348
I didn't do that.

325
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,310
Me neither.

326
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,358
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

327
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,653
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

328
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,572
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

329
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,829
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

330
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,874
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

331
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,836
...with the really nice breasts.

332
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,130
But what about back home?

333
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,800
Anything going on there?
Anybody you like?

334
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,638
No.

335
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,977
- There is. You're blushing.
- No, I'm not blushing...

336
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,603
...and I'm sunburned.

337
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,732
From, you know, the rain.

338
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,608
You like someone. Tell me who.

339
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,153
- Tell me who it is. Come on.
- No. Joey.

340
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,947
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

341
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,158
- Who do you like?
- Joey, come on!

342
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,746
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

343
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:16,250
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

344
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,843
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

345
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,762
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Do you?

346
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,598
- Yeah.
- Hey.

347
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,850
- Hey.
- I just left you a message.

348
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,894
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

349
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,897
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

350
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,817
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

351
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,737
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

352
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,489
- I had a great time.
- Yeah.

353
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,116
This isn't over,
because I really want to know...

354
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,743
Later. Later.

355
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,829
- So shall we?
- Yeah.

356
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,915
- Okay.
- Good night.

357
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,375
Good night.

358
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,802
- Okay, good night.
- Good night, Ross.

359
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,975
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

360
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,977
She's clearly in love with Mike.

361
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,981
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

362
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:30,699
Um... Phoebe, um,
I have, uh, something I want to say.

363
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,661
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

364
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,955
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

365
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:41,627
"Uh, Phoebe, um, I would be honored
if, uh, uh..." Spit it out, David!

366
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,005
Uh, Phoebe, um...

367
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:55,266
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

368
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,310
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

369
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,521
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

370
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:06,318
But, um, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

371
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,281
So to that end...

372
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,871
- Oh, my God, Mike.
- It's David, actually.

373
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,205
No, Mike's here.

374
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,792
Oh, hey, Mike.

375
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,296
Hi, David.

376
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,841
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

377
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,388
It's the humidity!

378
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,811
- Hi, Phoebe.
- What are you doing here?

379
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,606
I have a question I need to ask you.

380
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,526
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

381
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:52,072
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

382
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,951
Okay.

383
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,955
- Would you care for my seat as well?
- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

384
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,459
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

385
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,847
Phoebe, I love you.

386
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,808
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

387
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,228
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...
