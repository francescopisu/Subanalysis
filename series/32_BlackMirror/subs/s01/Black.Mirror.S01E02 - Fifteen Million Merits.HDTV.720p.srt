00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:16,149
Why don't you spend it on you, then?

184
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,972
And buy what? Some new shoes
for my doppel to wear?

185
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,939
I don't know, upgrade your MOS...

186
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,933
Or get a Fat Attack season pass?

187
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,819
Buy one of those wall buddies.

188
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,237
The new ones that talk to you after
shutting and solve your problems.

189
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,244
They guide your dreams, like gurus.
It's amazing, really, what they can do.

190
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,819
A mirror plug-in? That shows me how I
look as a werewolf? What's the point?

191
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,063
- I know it can be quite funny.
- It's all just stuff. It's...

192
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,168
It's stuff, it's confetti, it's...

193
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,726
You've got something real.

194
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,463
What better to spend it on?

195
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:56,652
You heard me singing in a toilet.

196
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,339
Is that real?

197
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,818
More than anything that's
happened all year.

198
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,529
I can't take that kind of clockage
off someone.

199
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,488
It's 12 mils, no way.

200
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,471
Let me do this.

201
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,424
I... I look around here, I just...

202
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,192
I just want something real to happen.

203
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,149
Just once.

204
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:31,499
I'd mess up.

205
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,344
You wouldn't. I don't care anyway.

206
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,179
I'll go with you.
I'll be able to force you.

207
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:39,075
I'll force you to go.

208
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,443
It's tomorrow.

209
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,771
Come on!

210
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,718
Say yes.

211
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:59,657
I'll go as far as to say, "OK."

212
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,671
Which proves acceptable.

213
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,656
Thank God for that.

214
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,050
Walking away now.

215
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,711
You loon!

216
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,191
I can live with it!

217
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,645
I'd love to fucking ruin that
and all.

218
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,126
What?

219
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,935
15?

220
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,817
A flippin' joke...

221
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,881
'New from Wraith Babes.

222
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,152
'The hottest girls
in the nastiest situations.'

223
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:26,771
Oh, yeah! Ooh!

224
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,871
Can't believe I'm doing this.

225
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,395
I am doing this.

226
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:53,304
I can't be doing this.

227
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,846
Can you trade it back?

228
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,595
The ticket?

229
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,970
Don't be mad.

230
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:01,345
It's a lot of pressure
to put someone under, you know.

231
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:04,464
Don't think I'm not grateful.
But it's, it's just...

232
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:05,795
You're babbling.

233
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,390
I'm babbling.

234
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,230
I made you this.

235
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,331
You never get to keep them more
than a day, but there it is, anyway.

236
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,294
It folds flat.

237
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:33,386
So you can keep them
in your waistband.

238
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,949
Thank you.

239
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,799
It's, you know...

240
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:47,407
something.

241
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:19,197
Face the screen, please.

242
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,599
Is he your Friends And Family
allocation?

243
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:27,777
Yeah.

244
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,470
Hand, please.

245
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:31,714
Oh!!

246
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:33,727
That's not permanent, is it?

247
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,239
Oh, no. Two months max.

248
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,498
Round to the right,
and through the scanner.

249
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:03,284
Where do we go now?

250
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,228
You wait here.

251
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,581
How long?

252
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,544
So, what do we do?

253
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:14,839
I don't know.

254
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,775
Hey, hey, hey.
Fuck off.

255
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,275
Her with the dark hair?

256
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

257
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,079
Yup. OK. Move.

258
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,088
They want to preview you.

259
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:34,519
- What?
- Preview. Come on.

260
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:36,523
- He's with me.
- Hand?

261
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:39,768
Show me your hand.

262
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,599
OK. You, too.

263
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:44,025
That's not fair.
She's new. That's not fair.

264
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,539
I don't pick the order.

265
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,268
I've waited here all week,
and she's just walked in.

266
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:52,162
Everyone will get seen eventually.
I don't pick the order.

267
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,646
But I'm a good singer.

268
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,270
I can sing. I'm a good singer, I am.

269
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,620
- Stand aside.
- It's not fair!

270
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,995
It's not fair!

271
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:09,084
- Next lot.
- Stand there.

272
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:16,224
Would you like to be as big as Salma
one day?

273
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,453
Erm...
Yeah, I mean...

274
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:20,719
Could you say that

275
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,317
as a self-contained sentence
into that screen?

276
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,359
I guess I'd like to be
as big as Salma one day.

277
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,319
OK. Proceed to stage area.

278
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,450
Are we done?

279
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,525
- Both performing?
- Just her.

280
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:40,159
- Okay... and what are you?
- Singer.

281
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,311
- Compliance?
- No, thanks.

282
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:45,536
A-ha. Yes, thanks!
It's compulsory for all contestants.

283
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,078
More to the point,
it'll stop you puking with nerves.

284
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,328
- She's got to perform.
- Well, mmm

285
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,749
Look, just sip it, you'll be fine.

286
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,357
Just a touch of light foam.
It'll pass.

287
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,906
Make the most of it.

288
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,877
You can't get this stuff
anywhere else.

289
00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:04,879
You OK?
Yeah.

290
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,189
You OK?

291
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:10,277
Yeah. Just, erm...

292
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,399
I don't know. Things are just
wider apart. I'm fine.

293
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:18,765
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,086
Right. You're on.

295
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:40,413
A little closer, please.

296
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,477
Little closer.

297
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:51,280
Into the light, love.

298
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:02,852
- And who're we looking at here?
- Abi Khan.

299
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,861
What are you going
to do for us today, Abi?

300
00:31:06,446 --> 00:31:07,839
I'm going to sing.

301
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,299
You speak up, love.

302
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:10,770
We don't bite.

303
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:13,692
I'm going to sing.

304
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,719
Hey, would you mind
lifting up your top for me?

305
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:20,976
Can you take off your top?

306
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:22,981
I want to check out those titties.

307
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:24,162
Woo-hoo-hoo!

308
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:25,471
Oh!

309
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:28,231
Come on. Mucho feranto.

310
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,258
Ah! No titties?

311
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,203
She says she's here to sing.

312
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,159
I got to see
those titties, though.

313
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:38,679
Come on, girl.

314
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,026
I mean, damn!

315
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:41,399
Heh-heh-heh.

316
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,079
You hot.

317
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:46,018
Please, just sing for us.

That was...

347
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,368
without a doubt...

348
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,839
probably the best piece of singing
we've had this season.

349
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,018
Yes! Well done!

350
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,549
Fair play.

351
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,399
But I have to say...

352
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,389
No. No, no, no.
I have to say,

353
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,555
actually,

354
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,210
I'm with Rafe on this one.

355
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:48,319
Good though your voice is...
and it is good.

356
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,519
It's not the most magical sound
in the world.

357
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,085
It's just... good.

358
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,134
I don't think anyone's
really hearing it.

359
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:59,758
Certainly not the guys
in the audience.

360
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:03,239
These looks you got going on
kind of get in the way.

361
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:06,012
Men will want you.
Women will hate you.

362
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,117
All the time you're on stage.

363
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,195
Couldn't help picturing you.

364
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,639
In an erotic scenario.

365
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:17,367
Getting pretty turned on,
if I'm honest.

366
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,555
Right.

367
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,364
You've got this pure beauty

368
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,150
What seems to be
a knockout figure.

369
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:30,799
And this sort of interesting
innocence going on.

370
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:33,259
That's something I think
Rafe's erotica channels

371
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:34,919
could really play with.

372
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,439
Absolutely. That's what I thought

373
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,839
the moment I saw you.

374
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:40,319
The moment.

375
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,199
I'd watch. I don't know a man here
who wouldn't.

376
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,675
To be honest,
some of us girls might join you.

377
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,946
Get off me!

378
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:53,388
Don't! Abi!

379
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:56,750
No! Abi! Abi!

380
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,879
I don't think that's quite...

381
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:05,757
You will never have to pedal again.
Not one minute.

382
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,945
We could really work with you.

383
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,215
Last year we had
singers, singers, singers.

384
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,778
So many singers.

385
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,637
So, to be a singer you have to be
truly exceptional

386
00:36:17,123 --> 00:36:20,839
There's just no slots left
for an above average singer.

387
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,559
Not for the next few years,
at least. Charity?

388
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,442
No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

389
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:29,615
Listen. We said,
right from the start.

390
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,315
We'll go with something
different this season.

391
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,355
That's why he's on the panel!

392
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,384
She would be a star on our stream.

393
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,239
A star.

394
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,196
On his...

395
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,279
You're furniture, at best.

396
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,142
Forget about all the shame,
and all that ppht-ppht-tew.

397
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,599
We medicate against that.

398
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,920
You will have pleasure forever.

399
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:55,507
Realistically, sweetheart,
it is that,

400
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,146
or the bike.

401
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,934
I, I don't think...

402
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:03,962
This is starting to annoy me.

403
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:07,511
Who do you think is powering
that spotlight?

404
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:15,401
Millions of people. That's who.

405
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:18,063
All of them, out there, right now.

406
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,243
Putting in an honest day
on the bike,

407
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,730
while you stand in the light
they're generating

408
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:24,913
and dither.

409
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:26,576
You know what?

410
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:30,707
They would give anything.
Do anything to be where you are now.

411
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,684
Am I right?!

412
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:39,170
You want to cock a snook at all
that, as though it's nothing.

413
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,653
As though they're nothing.

414
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,060
And that makes me sick.

415
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,683
But, you know what?

416
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,911
Maybe you do belong on the bike.

417
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,107
Because you don't seem to be
very willing to step off it.

418
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,235
I do want to.

419
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,578
We have a decision?

420
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:04,679
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

421
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,079
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

422
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,079
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

423
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,759
I suppose.

424
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,559
Woo-hoo-hoo! Go on!

425
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,865
Well done!

426
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,164

I... pay... for... this!

432
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:17,786
I pump my arse off, and you...
Fuck you!

433
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,639
Yeah, keep waddling, pig tits.

An entertainer.

Yes.

Mmm!

503
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,309
Hmm.

504
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,212

505
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,115

Stop or I'll do it. This is a main
artery. Keep walking, you kill me.

509
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:28,530
No-one stops me till I've said my piece.
Then you can do what you like.

Man, just fucking kill yourself.

Well?

518
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:00,757
Come on.

519
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:03,738
Got our attention, as requested.

520
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,586
What do you want to say?

521
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,959
Have you prepared a speech,
is that it?

522
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,238
Speak!

523
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:19,794
I haven't got a speech. I didn't
plan words. I didn't even try to...

524
00:52:19,795 --> 00:52:23,349
I just knew I had to get here, to stand
here, and I wanted you to listen.

525
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,336
To really listen, not just pull
a face like you're listening,

526
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,011
like you do the rest of the time.

527
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:30,640
A face that you're feeling
instead of processing.

528
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:33,439
You pull a face, and poke it towards
the stage,

529
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,835
and we lah-di-dah,
we sing and dance and tumble around.

530
00:52:37,844 --> 00:52:40,398
And all you see up here,
it's not people,

531
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,919
you don't see people up here,
it's all fodder.

532
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,384
And the faker the fodder,
the more you love it,

533
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,079
because fake fodder's the only
thing that works any more.

534
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,639
It's all that we can stomach.
Actually, not quite all.

535
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,959
Real pain, real viciousness,
that, we can take.

536
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,596
Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole.

537
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,519
We laugh ourselves feral,
because we've earned the right,

538
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,038
we've done cell time
and he's slacking, the scum,

539
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,267
so ha-ha-ha at him!

540
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:03,887
Because we're so out of our minds
with desperation,

541
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,630
we don't know any better.

542
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:08,119
All we know is fake fodder
and buying shit.

543
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,919
That's how we speak to each other,

544
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,168
how we express ourselves,
is buying shit.

545
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,559
What, I have a dream?

546
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,865
The peak of our dreams is a new app
for our Dopple, it doesn't exist!

547
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:19,279
It's not even there!

548
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,039
We buy shit that's not even there.

549
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,239
Show us something real and free
and beautiful. You couldn't.

550
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,719
Yeah? It'd break us.

551
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,319
We're too numb for it.

552
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,799
I might as well choke.

553
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,839
It's only so much wonder
we can bear.

554
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,524
When you find any wonder whatsoever,
you dole it out in meagre portions.

555
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:36,867
Only then until it's
augmented, packaged, and

556
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:39,395
pumped through 10,000
preassigned filters

557
00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:42,439
till it's nothing more than
a meaningless series of lights,

558
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,839
while we ride day in day out,
going where?

559
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,041
Powering what?

560
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:51,826
All tiny cells and tiny screens
and bigger cells

561
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:53,604
and bigger screens and fuck you!

562
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:56,913
Fuck you,
that's what it boils down to.

563
00:53:57,622 --> 00:54:01,159
Fuck you for sitting there
and slowly making things worse.

564
00:54:01,284 --> 00:54:04,719
Fuck you and your spotlight
and your sanctimonious faces.

565
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,999
Fuck you all for thinking
the one thing

566
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,239
I came close to never meant
anything.

567
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:14,172
For oozing around it and crushing it
into a bone, into a joke.

568
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,639
One more ugly joke
in a kingdom of millions.

569
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,087
Fuck you for happening.

570
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,555
Fuck you for me, for us,
for everyone.

571
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:25,879
Fuck you!

572
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:50,424
That was, without a doubt,

573
00:54:52,257 --> 00:54:56,112
the most heartfelt thing
I've seen on this stage

574
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:58,386
since Hotshot began!

575
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:05,178
Brilliant!

576
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,824
You...

577
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:10,559
you're so articulating
something we all,

578
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,235
and I mean everyone in this hall,

579
00:55:13,617 --> 00:55:15,679
something we all agree on.

580
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:18,879
Even though we may not comprehend
all of it.

581
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:22,362
I think I'm right in saying
we do feel it.

582
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,035
Even me.

583
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,675
I know you've got me down
as this creature.

584
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:30,050
You know, hey...

585
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:33,754
I get where you're coming from.

586
00:55:34,057 --> 00:55:36,308
- I like your stuff.
- It's not stuff.

587
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,317
It's truth. Am I right?

588
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:43,919
Your truth, admittedly,
but truth nonetheless.

589
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,950
And you're right.

590
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:49,777
Authenticity is in woefully
short supply.

591
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:54,077
I'd like to hear you talk again.

592
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,790
How so?

593

The slot on one of my streams

594
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:05,251
where you can talk just like that.

595
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:11,609
I'd watch it.
It was such great passion.

596
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:17,380
He's a'right.
You're a little hot there, bud.

597
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,442

Neat gimmick.
