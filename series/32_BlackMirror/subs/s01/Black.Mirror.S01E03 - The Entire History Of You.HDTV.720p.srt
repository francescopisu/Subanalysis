1
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:21,069
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

2
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,387
Thank you.

3
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,906
OK, little speech time.

4
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:26,637
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

5
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,383
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

6
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:32,023
It is much more of a...

7
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,477
treasure hunt for the gold?

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,655
Shit sinks.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,437
But also, cream floats.

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:41,199
Yes, yes, I see that.

11
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:44,014
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in...

12
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,438
and your office could
be at the centre for...

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,877
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

14
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:51,164
Retrospective...

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,990
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

16
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:57,803
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

17
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,716
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,237
And morally?

19
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:07,971
Yep.

20
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,018
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,077
Sure.

22
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,889
Yeah, yeah, right.

23
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,550
Are you?

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,590
Totally, yeah.

25
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,637
Yes.

26
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,454
OK, Liam, look,

27
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:25,091
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

28
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,274
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

29
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,346
with personnel, maybe... next week.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,797
Oh, well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

31
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:35,977
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

32
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:39,822
But I have to ask you this...
they're not going to hit anything

33
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:41,787
to freak us out, are they?

34
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,663
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

35
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,647
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

36
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:51,419
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

37
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,588
Um...

38
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:58,247
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

39
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:04,194
OK, thank you.

40
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,476
Airport, please.

41
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,842
'Live...

42
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,110

this has been really great, Liam,

we really hope to... look forward
to seeing you again.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,519
We really hope to... look forward
to seeing you again.

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,574
Sorry!

54
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,564
Mr Foxwell.

55
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,353
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,509
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

57
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,159
That's great.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,886
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

59
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,027
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

60
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,589
Look at what?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,899
That!

62
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,436
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

63
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,743
Seriously?

64
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,357
Yes, seriously!

65
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,519
This is a five-star suite.

66
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,375
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

67
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:38,479
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

68
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,559
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

69
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,460
Oh, thanks, Jonas!

70
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,928
Fuck off.

71
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,534
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

72
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:57,557
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

73
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,573
Oh, that's right, yes, hi, Liam.

74
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,525
Hi... Hi again.

75
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,492
Hello.

76
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,029
Lucy... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

77
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,599
Liam!

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,905
Oh, great.

79
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,479
Liam, yes.

80
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,239
Come in.
Thank you.

81
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,693
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,119
Where's Fi been hiding you?

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,037
Oh, you know, in our house.

84
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,262
We didn't know... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

85
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,115
It was over quicker than I thought.

86
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh, sorry, hello.

87
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,829
Let's get you a drink.
Um, beer OK?

88
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,533
Lovely, thank you.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,694
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

90
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,814
OK, thank you.

91
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,119
Hi.

92
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,743
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

93
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,424
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

94
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,833
- Hi.
- Hello.

95
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,755
So, how was the appraisal?

96
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:15,319
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,047
Oh.
But good?

98
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,521
Well...

99
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,585
- Later?
- Later.

100
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,606
OK.

101
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,734
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

102
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,166
Hey.

103
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,434
Jonas, this is...

104
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,457
- Liam...
- Jonas.

105
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,479
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

106
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,679
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,351
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

108
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,484
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

109
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,478
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

110
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

111
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:44,824
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,976
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

113
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,199
Oh, well she's like that.

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,606
Yeah, tell me about it.

115
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,113
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

116
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,325
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's, um...

117
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,639
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

118
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,625
And Jeff.

119
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,963
Jeff and Fi...

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,439
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

121
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,225
Mad old days.

122
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,917
Before we started up the Kings.

123
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,837
So, yeah...

124
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:24,635
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

125
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,962
Appraisal.

126
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,239
How'd it go?

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,637
Good.

128
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,873
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

129
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,232
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,525
Let's have a look.

131
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,740
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

132
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,277
Yeah, great.

133
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:42,411
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

134
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,550
- Come on.
- Um...

135
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,677
It could be fun, we could, um...

136
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,727
vote!

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,885
- Paul?
- Yeah?

138
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,995
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

139
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:53,601
Right, OK.

140
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,275
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,397
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

142
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,679
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,843
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

144
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,319
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,599
so let's just drop it, yeah?

146
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,940
Have a cool time.

147
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,119
Time to eat!

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,566
Oh, it's ready.

149
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,824
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

150
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,672
It's been too long, too long.

151
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,518
Fi.

152
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:31,309
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

153
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,040
He's one of the old crowd.

154
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,631
I think I said.

155
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,578
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,880
- You know, if you're not in the mood, we can go.
- No, no, I'm fine.

157
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,913
Sure?

158
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,618
Hey!

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,339
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

160
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:07,500
Thank you.

161
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,660
I've, er, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

162
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:12,580
Jonas has had a tough one.

163
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,060
Was it bad?

164
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,301
Er, yeah.

165
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:20,136
Yeah, erm, we were in the middle
of planning is all

166
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:24,314
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

167
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,334
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

168
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,900
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

169
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,940
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

170
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:37,201
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

171
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:40,078
So, everybody, this is Helen.

172
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,453
Helen, Jonas.

173
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:43,976
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,062
And everyone!

175
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,736
- Hi!
- Help yourself.

176
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:51,660
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

177
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,260
Are they? Shit!

178
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,363
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

179
00:09:56,488 --> 00:10:00,620
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

180
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,740
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

181
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:07,740
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

182
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,888
The problem is the
more that you pay

183
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:14,100
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Oh, yeah, we loved it!",

184
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:17,900
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

185
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,978
"and only just having
one other person"

186
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:25,296
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

187
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,413
Would you say you loved her, though?

188
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:35,286
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

189
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:36,724
You know what it's like early on.

190
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,860
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

191
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,020
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

192
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,740
that just fit together
really fucking well.

193
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:47,376
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

194
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,580
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

195
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,179
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

196
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,300
hot times in earlier relationships!

197
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,613
Easy!

198
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,029
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

199
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,425
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

200
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,687
What, right now?

201
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,340
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

202
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,340
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

203
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,213
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

204
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:20,131
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

205
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,192
Oh, come on...

206
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:26,860
Come on, guys.

207
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,620
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

208
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,220
rifling through our greatest hits

209
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,296
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

210
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,722
Not me.

211
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:38,763
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

212
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,656
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

213
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,320
No shit!

214
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,620
Was that a political thing?

215
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,140
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

216
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,620
Jesus, was that painful?

217
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,860
Total agony.

218
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,660
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

219
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,180
There's a scar on here.

220
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:59,615
Yeah, can I, er...?

221
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,020
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

222
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,580
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

223
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,380
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

224
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:20,638
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

225
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,460
So, who took it then?

226
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:24,780
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

227
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:28,140
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

228
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,740
Really?! Yeah.

229
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,420
Is that for real?

230
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,500
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

231
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,500
So, they saw the lot!

232
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,769
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

233
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:40,751
and then just kind of, liked it.

234
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:45,980
It's cool.

235
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,060
That's cool.

236
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,220
I mean, because more people are...

237
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,900
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

238
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,340
I believe it's huge with hookers.

239
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,020
I mean, no offence!

240
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,860
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

241
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,078
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

242
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,234
Boo!

243
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,020
Serial monogamist.

244
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,838
I'm a serial monogamist.

245
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,580
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

246
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,700
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

247
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,860
It's a brave choice.

248
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,618
I'm sorry, but I...

249
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,620
I couldn't do it.

250
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,104
Uh-huh.

251
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,660
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

252
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,100
Yay!

253
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,500
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

254
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,395
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

255
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,016
just not trustworthy.

256
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,780
Colleen works in Grain development.

257
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,857
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

258
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,207
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

259
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,731
You can make people
remember getting lost

260
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,620
in shopping malls they
never visited,

261
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,633
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

262
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,626
I'm just happier now.

263
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:07,700
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great, erm...

264
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,419
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

265
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,388
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

266
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,820
"Hopes" to look forward.

267
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:18,460
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

268
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:19,765
It's phoney.

269
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,425
Hang on.

270
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,688
Pause it.

271
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,223
Now backup.

272
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:27,450
Zoom in there.

273
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,740
Come on, that's a tick.

274
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,300
That could be a V or an L.

275
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,696
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

276
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,112
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

277
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,656
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

278
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,540
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

279
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,397
No, no, not really.

280
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,331
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

281
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,020
Bit of a dick?

282
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,060
Jonas.

283
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:02,620
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

284
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, it must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

285
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:08,660
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

286
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,500
"Hey, come on, guys,"

287
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:13,180
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

288
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,020
Then why invite him over?

289
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,327
I like him.

290
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,700
You wanted me to invite him.

291
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,380
I didn't say anything.

292
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,940
You were laughing
at everything he said.

293
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:31,460
You invited him!

294
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,799
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

295
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,220
'Wow, it's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

296
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:40,936
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

297
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,260
'Oh, we've got to get back,

298
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,820
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

299
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:47,699
'Yeah.'

300
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:53,460
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

301
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,500
See?

302
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:58,757
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

303
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,728
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

304
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:14,810
Hey, hey!

305
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:15,883
Hey.

306
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:19,713
Well, actually, what time is it?

307
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,231
It's midnight.

308
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,327
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

309
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:25,344
Yeah, time does that.

310
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:26,580
15 minutes.

311
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:27,740
Yeah.

312
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,768
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

313
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:32,740
So, is that new info?

314
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,740
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

315
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:38,820
Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:40,180
OK, no, I get it.

317
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:42,300
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

318
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,340
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

319
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,380
Sorry.

320
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,220
No, it's fine, really.

321
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,260
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh, it's cool, no worries.

323
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,700
I've got a back-up plan, so...

324
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,460
Oh, cool, well, we vote the back-up.

325
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,900
Yeah, I will do.

326
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:57,660
Er, see you later, Fi.

327
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:58,820
It was good to meet you, man.

328
00:16:58,821 --> 00:16:59,832
Yeah.

329
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,300
Nice one.

330
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:02,721
Brilliant. Brilliant.

331
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,210
OK, cool.

332
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,373
Good to meet you, man.

333
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,510
Yeah.

334
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:18,580
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

335
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:20,874
I have the bed made up in my office.

336
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,316
Er... OK, thanks, Fi.

337
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,980
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

338
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:29,988
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,020
All right, night.

340
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,060
Night, guys.

341
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,374
Night, Gina.

342
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:41,995
Thank you.

343
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,586
'Bye-bye.

344
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,500
'OK.

345
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,768
'Love you, love you.'

346
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,940
Was he a big part of the gang?

347
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:11,329
Who? Jonas?

348
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,225
I don't know, yeah?

349
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,340
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

350
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,420
offering backrubs.

351
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:21,700
Not really.

352
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,448
Circling for an orifice.

353
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,140
Was he always that oily or...

354
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,447
OK, look.

355
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,820
What?

356
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,130
It's nothing, but...

357
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:39,900
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

358
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:45,140
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

359
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,300
You had a thing with oily dude man?

360
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:48,380
It was just a little thing

361
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:49,900
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

362
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:51,557
You slept with oily dude man?

363
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:53,700
That's hilarious!

364
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,380
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

365
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:57,980
What, I told you about Gemma.

366
00:18:57,981 --> 00:18:59,324
Gemma was a nutcase...

367
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,362
But you never mentioned Jonas.

368
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:05,256
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

369
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:06,453
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

370
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:07,700
It was a stupid thing...

371
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:11,740
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

372
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:12,780
Not him.

373
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,940
It was years ago and...

374
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,340
Are you embarrassed by that?

375
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,317
Cos it's embarrassing.

376
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,110
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

377
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,590
It was years ago.

378
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,350
But you dated him for a month?

379
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:27,550
That's what I said.

380
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:31,550
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

381
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,408
No, I didn't.

382
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,543
Pah!

383
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,390
'What about you?'

384
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,670
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

385
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:43,750
Shh, you're about to talk.

386
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,910
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

387
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:50,030
'with this, sort of...

388
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,590
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

389
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:54,910
'Mr Marrakech?'

390
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,230
'Yeah.'

391
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:59,630
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

392
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,630
'No, it was like dormouse.'

393
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,550
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

394
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,990
'No, it was just a week.

395
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:11,310
'It was a weird week.'

396
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,630
So, a weird week or a month?

397
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,470
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

398
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,230
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

399
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,464
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

400
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,710
That was a nice night, used to be.

401
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,207
You're getting obsessed.

402
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,150
I'm not.

403
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,630
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

404
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,430
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

405
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,430
What? Acting like
he was interested?

406
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,590
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

407
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,670
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

408
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:44,608
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

409
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,310
And Jonas...

410
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:52,310
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

411
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:53,950
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

412
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,190
No, I mean, just...

413
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:59,190
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

414
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,276
I didn't mean that.

415
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,030
'You're a bitch!'

416
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,190
I'd like you to erase that.

417
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,270
'You're a bitch!'

418
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,150
Also, "sometimes".

419
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:15,325
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

420
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:00,934
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

421
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,750
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

422
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:33,070
'..In a toolshed that just fit
together really fucking well,

423
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:36,390
'but still by the end I'd be like,
"Go, on, you go to bed, honey,

00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,590
'"I'm just going to catch a little
bit more of the news,"

425
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:42,430

00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,255
'Easy!'

'I was nervous when I heard you
were going to be here.

'It's weird, isn't it?'

435
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,179
- Morning.
- Gina, over here.

436
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,261
Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

437
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:22,882
It's just a silly game.

438
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:29,061
Sit down.

439
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:30,791
Answer this.

440
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,261
I'm a serial monogamist.

441
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:37,821
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

442
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,644
Now, is that funny?

443
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,872
There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

444
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:52,541
Is that funny, in your opinion?

445
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,337
Well...

446
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,069
I'm a serial monogamist.

447
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,421
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

448
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:02,729
- No?
- No

449
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,541
- I don't know.
- You do.

450
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:06,573
Morning.

451
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:07,985
What's this?

452
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,391
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

453
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,088
I'm a serial monogamist.

454
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:15,181
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

455
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:20,180
I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

456
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,622
and Gina agrees.

457
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:23,202
I don't really want to get involved.

458
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:25,341
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

459
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:26,821
Just one other thing.

460
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:32,669
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

461
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,939
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

462
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:37,620
OK, well, bye.

463
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,791
Yeah, bye.

464
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:42,148
Wow, it's early. It's early
to call it a night.

465
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,228
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

466
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:47,344
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

467
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,541
That's just a...

468
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:50,626
That's a joke.

469
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:51,994
Sorry.

470
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:55,935
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

471
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,188
Yeah.

472
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:03,165
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

473
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,618
I don't know.

474
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,876
You do know, Gina.

475
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:08,031
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

476
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,425
That's OK.

477
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,567
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

478
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:29,500
That is just objectively not funny.

479
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:31,499
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

480
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:33,251
That was fucking embarrassing.

481
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:38,941
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

482
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:40,450
Sit down, please.

483
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,461
You see that?

484
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,014
You know Geoff?

485
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,981
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

486
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:00,981
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

487
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,700
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

488
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,781
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

489
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:09,141
and then I arrived and... you clam.

490
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:11,197
For clarity.

491
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:15,261
We're just talking!

492
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,739
But moments later, you're so stiff.

493
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:20,389
I don't know, a re-do...

494
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,530
You don't know how
to stand around him.

495
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,981
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

496
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:26,421
This is just stupid!

497
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:28,506
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

498
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,111
See how you look at him.

499
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:35,381
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

500
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:38,661
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

501
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:41,461
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

502
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:44,181
Now, how you look at me.

503
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:46,701
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

504
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,061
It's a brave choice.

505
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:51,581
I'm sorry, but...

506
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,661
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

507
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:57,261
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

508
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,261
How long did you go out
with him for?

509
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,278
Does it matter?

510
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,901
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

511
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,693
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

512
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,061
And big ones.

513
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,343
Is that Marrakesh?

514
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,484
Does that look like Marrakesh?

515
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:24,901
No.

516
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,901
It's not Marrakesh.

517
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:30,901
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

518
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,699
All right, about six months.

519
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,977
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

520
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,473
The ever-inflating romance.

521
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,421
You're probably still
going out with him.

522
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,019
Why am I on trial here?

523
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,101
What's been going on?

524
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:52,181
Nothing has been going on.

525
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:56,616
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

526
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,937
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

527
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,230
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

528
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:04,705
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

529
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,580
You lied.

530
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,539
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

531
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,141
Hello?

532
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:15,325
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

533
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:16,767
Sort of? He's a massive...

534
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,581
I liked him then.

535
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:22,254
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

536
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,799
So, just to get this clear.

537
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:28,721
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

538
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:29,677
but you're still pally.

539
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:30,659
This is sad!

540
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,677
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

541
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:34,519
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

542
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,054
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

543
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,323
It was years ago!

544
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,698
Not for him.

545
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,359
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

546
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:46,187
early in relationships.

547
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:47,461
'Easy.'

548
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,660
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

549
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:53,339
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

550
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,405
Fuck.

551
00:29:56,022 --> 00:30:00,514
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

552
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:02,678
early in relationships.

553
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,006
Easy.

554
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:10,341
And I'm downstairs watching
some redo of some night

555
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,501
I've picked up somebody else and...

556
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:16,981
Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me

557
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,661
and I'm downstairs watching
some redo

558
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,821
of some night I've picked
up somebody else.

559
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,421
Easy.

560
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,339
And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.

561
00:30:29,714 --> 00:30:31,169
'Green warning.

562
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,930

00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:44,327
Thank you.

567
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:01,736
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

568
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:05,092
Liam from last night.

569
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,899
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

570
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:10,620
She's not, no.

571
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:14,152
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

572
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,576
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

573
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:17,782
Can you open the gate?

574
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:21,276
Yeah, sure.
I'll let you in.

575
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,079
Nice one, nice one.

576
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,998
- Hey.
- Hey.

577
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,421
What do you want?

578
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,755
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

579
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:47,939
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

580
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,821
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

581
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:52,099
Fucking hell. Liam.

582
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:02,208
Jonas, this is a nice place!

583
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,884
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

584
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,337
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

585
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,158
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

586
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,259
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

587
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:25,384
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

588
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:27,286
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

589
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:30,621
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

590
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,499
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

591
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:45,787
I'm joking, Jonas.

592
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:48,581
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

593
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:51,340
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

594
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:53,175
What's going on?

595
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,499
Yeah, figures.

596
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:01,579
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

597
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,356
I think you should go.

598
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:06,501
I don't blame you.
I would have.

599
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:09,190
Tell you what, let's have a look.

600
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:12,101
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

601
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:13,703
Come on!

602
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,074
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

603
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,855
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

604
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:23,119
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

605
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,223
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

606
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:32,252
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

607
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:37,188
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

608
00:33:37,313 --> 00:33:40,021
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

609
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:42,328
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

610
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,758
I want you to leave.

611
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:50,641
Well, that's a pity.

612
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:53,338
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

613
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:55,657
Don't do that.
Come on now!

614
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:58,155
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

615
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:01,897
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

616
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,007
Hey.

617
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,172
What do you want?

618
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,255
Don't do that.

619
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:51,714
Come on, Danny!

620
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,504
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

621
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,741
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

622
00:34:56,765 --> 00:34:58,133
'Tell you what... '

623
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,525
Stop it!

624
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:07,819
I tell you what you're going to do.

625
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,499
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

626
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,539
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

627
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,265
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

628
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,242
'Wipe it!

629
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,455
'Fuck off.

630
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:21,579
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

631
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,739
This is a bottle, right?

632
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,961
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

633
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,006
Jesus!

634
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,063
OK.

635
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,157
Just do what he says.

636
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,515
Not on your eye, in there.

637
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,059
On there!

638
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,319
He's doing it!

639
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:42,406
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

640
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:47,465
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

641
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,904
I'm doing it.

642
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,741
Stay away from my house!

643
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,699
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

644
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:18,453
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

645
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,858
'I'm doing it.'

646
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:07,900
Liam?

647
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,611
Where did you go?

648
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,976
What happened?

649
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,379
Liam, what happened?

650
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,149
Did you use a condom or not?

651
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,916
Just say.

652
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,139
Liam, whatever you think...

653
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,472
Am I Jodie's father?

654
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,099
- Liam!
- Am I?

655
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,179
Yes, of course.

656
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:38,059
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

657
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,127
That's nice.

658
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,745
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

659
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:49,083
It's why I bought it for you.

660
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:52,739
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

661
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,040
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

662
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:10,059
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

663
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,419
' Christ, what have you done?

664
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,499
'Select it all... '

665
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,979
We're getting to the good bit.

666
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,042
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

667
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,179
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

668
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,809
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

669
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,078
18 months ago in this room.

670
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:55,515
You know when you suspect something,

671
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,717
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

672
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,179
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

673
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,797
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

674
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,579
That's not what it looks like.

675
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,379
Oh, this did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

676
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,419
No, it was...

677
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,579
A story about fucking?

678
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,179
It was...

679
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,255
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

680
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,459
For like ten minutes.

681
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,295
For five days, Liam.

682
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,832
No call, no nothing.

683
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,779
So you fucked him after four days?

684
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,259
That's heroic.

685
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,099
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

686
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,899
I mean, you must have been gagging.

687
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,421
I was so upset.

688
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,367
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

689
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,605
It shouldn't have happened.

690
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:52,317
I'm sorry.

691
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:57,779
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

692
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,052
I love you.

693
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,299
Did you use a condom?

694
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,459
Yes.

695
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,224
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

696
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,859
He had some.

697
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,619
In his pocket?

698
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,002
In his car.

699
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:18,237
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

700
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:19,663
I made him.

701
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,706
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

702
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,472
Show me, then.

703
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:27,740
Show me on there.

704
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,613
I need to see it, Fi.

705
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,095
I deleted it.

706
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,699
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

707
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:44,275
- Did you?
- Yeah.

708
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,544
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

709
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,117
Yeah.

710
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:50,498
Show me that, then.

711
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,319
Yeah, OK.

712
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:58,681
I have to find it.

713
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:07,155
No! No deleting it, not now.

714
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,219
No, no.

715
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,697
It's still on there, is it?

716
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,877
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:21,899
You have to show it to me, Fi.

718
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,099
Why?

719
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,495
Cos I want to see it.

720
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:28,730
I love you.

721
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,827
Show it to me.

722
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,339
No.

723
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,579
- Show it to me.
- No.

724
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,819
- Show it to me!
- No!

725
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,384
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

726
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,235
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

727
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,925
Fi, I need to see it!

728
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:49,238
Please.

729
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,459
I need to see it, Fi.

730
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:38,354
'Hurry up.

731
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,635
'Sorry!'

732
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:39,946
I love you.

733
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,297
I know you do.

734
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,019
Oh!

735
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,085
Hello, stinky!

736
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:41,723
Hey.

737
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:07,514
Brown or green?

738
00:46:08,211 --> 00:46:09,540
Green?
