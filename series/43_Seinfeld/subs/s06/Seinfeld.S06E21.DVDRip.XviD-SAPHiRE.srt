1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,200
The worst part about
a car breaking down...

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,541
...is you're a guy. Because
now you have to get out...

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,336
...and pretend like you know
what you're doing.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:16,710
You gotta go, " All right, honey,
I'm gonna go check it out."

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,315
Walk around the front,
open up the hood.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,344
That's good, it obscures her view.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,785
That's the main reason
you want to do that.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,324
You're looking in there, hoping you're
going to see something in there...

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,157
...so simple, so obvious,
so incredibly easy to fix...

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,730
...even you can handle it.

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,925
<i>Like a giant on/off switch turned off.</i>

12
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,865
So you're going out
with David Puddy.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,771
Yeah. What, is that a problem?

14
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,912
I think he could've asked me.
He's supposed to be a friend mine.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,538
I guess he figured you wouldn't care.
It has been a few years.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,584
Elaine, you always care
who an ex-girlfriend dates.

17
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,220
You don't want someone
you know...

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,379
...and you don't want
someone better than you.

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,957
Now, even though the latter
is obviously impossible...

20
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,617
- Oh, God.
- ...the former still applies.

21
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,196
I don't know, I just can't see you
with a mechanic.

22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,730
Oh, yeah, right, right.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,698
All those mechanics do
is work all day with their hands...

24
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,359
...and their big muscular arms...

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,369
...on machines,
and then they come home...

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,998
...dripping with animal sexuality
like Stanley Kowalski.

27
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,941
- What a huge turnoff that is.
- All right.

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,946
Hey, look at that.
They got lobster on the menu.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,179
Who would order a lobster here?

30
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,985
I mean, do they bring a lobster in
every day hoping, "Today's the day."

31
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,786
So what if they have a lobster?

32
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,932
Suddenly you're
a shellfish connoisseur?

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,492
I think we really need to be
in front of a television set.

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,868
You take TV out of this relationship,
it is just torture.

35
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,037
So I'm getting an eye job.

36
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,610
An eye job?
Ma, you don't need an eye job.

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,649
- Georgie, I'm a divorcée.
- You're not a divorcée.

38
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,616
You're just separated.
You're a " separatée."

39
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,086
- Well, I'm out there, George.
- You're not out there.

40
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,316
- I am too.
- You're not out there.

41
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,085
You can't be,
because I am out there.

42
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,558
And if I see you out there...

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,754
...there's not enough voltage
in this world...

44
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,923
...to electroshock me
back into coherence.

45
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,194
Well, anyway, the operation
is on Tuesday...

46
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:23,706
...and I need you to drive me home
because I'll be all drugged up.

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,309
Tuesday? I can't do Tuesday.
Steinbrenner needs me-

48
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,209
This is the only time the doctor had.

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,180
- Kramer, hey! Come on over here.
- I gotta go somewhere.

50
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,684
No, you're gonna sit down,
you son of a gun.

51
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,947
All right, I'm sitting down.

52
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,852
How are you?

53
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,753
So, Kramer, I'm getting an eye job.

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,261
Yeah, good for you.

55
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,558
You have to look your best.
You're out there now.

56
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,668
She's not out there.

57
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,802
- So who's your doctor?
- Bakersaul.

58
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,371
He's good. He's very good.

59
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,512
He worked on this kid
from Guatemala with no nose...

60
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,738
...turned him into
Ricardo Montalban.

61
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,940
Hey, Kramer, what are
you doing Tuesday?

62
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,744
Tuesday?

63
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,411
Why doesn't he pick you up
after the operation?

64
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,419
He's got the car
with the seats you like.

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,989
- I don't care.
- Yeah, I know.

66
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,753
But I can't drive anybody anywhere
until I go down to get my new plates.

67
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,420
- Well, giddyup.
- All right.

68
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,561
I'm here to pick up my new plates.
My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

69
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,872
Kramer.

70
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,404
- All right.
- All right.

71
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,035
- Sign right here, please.
- Okay.

72
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,708
Alrighty.

73
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,182
Thanks.

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,056
No, these don't belong to me.
I'm not the Assman.

75
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,162
I think there's been a mistake.

76
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,731
- What's your name again?
- Cosmo Kramer.

77
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,966
Cosmo Kramer.
You are the Assman.

78
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,462
No, I'm not the Assman.

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,407
Well, as far as the state of New York
is concerned, you are.

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,757
How do you feel?

81
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,964
Fine.

82
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,692
Something the matter?

83
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,494
No.

84
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,801
Then what is it?

85
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,067
No, nothing.

86
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,409
Hey.

87
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,045
- I was with David Puddy last night.
- Yeah, so?

88
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,120
He did the move.

89
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:56,056
- What move?
- You know, the move.

90
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,992
Wait a second, my move?

91
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,893
David Puddy used my move?

92
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,125
- Yes, Yes.
- Are you sure?

93
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,363
Jerry, there is no confusing
that move with any other move.

94
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,866
I can't believe it. He stole my move.

95
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,701
What else did you tell him?

96
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,039
The two of you must have had
quite a little chat.

97
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,580
Oh, it wasn't like that.
I didn't even mention you.

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,514
We were in the garage.
You know how garages are.

99
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:25,249
They're conducive to sex talk.
It's a high-testosterone area.

100
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,825
Because of all the pistons
and the lube jobs?

101
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,656
Well, I'm going to that garage
to tell him to stop doing it.

102
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,856
- Well, wait- Wait a second.
- What?

103
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,002
Isn't that a little rash?

104
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,536
No, he stole my move.

105
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,104
Yeah, but I like the move.

106
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,880
Yeah, but it's like another comedian
stealing my material.

107
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,141
He doesn't even do it
exactly the same.

108
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,413
He uses a pinch at the end
instead of the swirl.

109
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,584
Oh, yeah, the pinch.
I've done the pinch.

110
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,694
That's not new.

111
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,362
I don't know how you can trust
any of his moves now.

112
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,897
His whole repertoire
could be lifted.

113
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,233
You know, it's strange, because
he's such an honest mechanic.

114
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,272
I know, he's probably the only
honest mechanic in New York.

115
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,473
So he stole my move,
and he's using it on Elaine.

116
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,078
You told David Puddy your move,
and you didn't tell me?

117
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,442
I need a move.
You know I have no moves, Jerry.

118
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,811
- Give me a bite.
- Can I just get it open first?

119
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,044
I can't believe you're
hoarding sex moves.

120
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,247
I'm rubbing two sticks together,
you're walking around with a Zippo.

121
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,392
All right, all right. Here.

122
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,659
That's good. That's very good.

123
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,591
- You feel better?
- Yeah, much better.

124
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,096
So, what's the move?
Because I need something.

125
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,099
This woman I'm dating is doing
her nails during lovemaking.

126
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,463
- Nancy Klopper?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,332
I've never seen anyone so bored.

128
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,066
I'm working like a dog here.
Give me a moan, something.

129
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,473
I'd settle for a belch, for God's sake.
Come on, let's have it.

130
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,705
All right, George, I'm gonna tell you.
But I just want to make sure-

131
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,282
Yeah, it's in the vault.
I'm putting it in the vault.

132
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,112
It's not even a question of that.

133
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,811
The point is, when something
like this is passed along...

134
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,288
...one must be certain that it's going
to be used in a conscientious way.

135
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,484
This is not some parlor trick
to be used...

136
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,186
- ...pell-mell or willy-nilly.
- You gonna tell me or not?

137
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,258
All right.

138
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,993
On your bed, you got a headboard?
You'll need a headboard.

139
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,227
I got a headboard.

140
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,563
- Is it padded?
- No.

141
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,365
Good.

142
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,733
- How tall is she?
- Five-foot-4, why?

143
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,811
You can't have more than
a 1 foot differential in your heights.

144
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,573
Otherwise you could
really hurt your neck.

145
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,841
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

146
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,385
George, if you can master this,
you'll never be alone again.

147
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,818
Now the end is kind of an option.
I use the swirl.

148
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,758
I like the swirl.
I'm comfortable with the swirl.

149
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,900
I feel the swirl is a great capper.

150
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,332
He uses the pinch,
which I find a little presumptuous.

151
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,803
- Is it a clockwise swirl?
- I prefer clockwise.

152
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,067
But it's not written in stone.

153
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,372
There you go, buddy.

154
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,520
- What is it?
- It's fusilli Jerry.

155
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,490
It's made from fusilli pasta.

156
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,990
See the microphone?

157
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,994
- When did you do this?
- In my spare time.

158
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,897
I'm working on one of you, George.
I'm using ravioli.

159
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,500
See, the hard part is to find
a pasta that captures the individual.

160
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,299
- Why fusilli?
- Because you're silly.

161
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,637
Get it?

162
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,011
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you very much.

163
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,588
- So did you get your new plates?
- Oh, yeah, I got my new plates.

164
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,780
But they mixed them up.

165
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,187
Somebody got mine,
and I got their vanity plates.

166
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,462
- What do they say?
- "Assman."

167
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,028
- Assman?
- Yeah, Assman, Jerry.

168
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,396
I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman.

169
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,927
Who would order a license plate
that says Assman?

170
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,566
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.

171
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,842
It doesn't have to be someone
who gets lots of woman.

172
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,311
It could be just some guy
with a big ass.

173
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,883
- Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,154
- Proctologist.
- No, come on.

175
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,257
No doctor would put that
on his car.

176
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,360
Have you ever met a proctologist?

177
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,489
Well, they usually have
a very good sense of humor.

178
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,566
You meet a proctologist at a party,
don't walk away.

179
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,101
Plant yourself there. You will hear
the funniest stories you've ever heard.

180
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:37,301
See, no one wants to admit to them
that they stuck something up there.

181
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,744
Never. It's always an accident.

182
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,278
Every proctologist's story
ends in the same way:

183
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,906
"It was a million-1 shot, doc.
Million-1."

184
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,417
There's my phone.

185
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,186
- So where you gonna stick this?
- I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.

186
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,128
Hey, David.

187
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,321
Oh, hi, Jerry.

188
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,966
Hey, what's the story?
I hear you're doing my move.

189
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,324
What move?

190
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,561
What move? My move.
The one I told you about.

191
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,103
You used it on Elaine.

192
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,833
What, are you kidding?
I was doing that before I knew you.

193
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,035
- All you told me about was the end.
- The ending is the whole thing.

194
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,806
Without the ending, it's nothing.
You had nothing.

195
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,110
That ending was so obvious.
I would've figured that out anyway.

196
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,276
Didn't need you to tell me
that stupid twist.

197
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,944
- Twirl.
- Whatever, I don't do it.

198
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,522
- Yeah, I know. You do the pinch.
- Yeah. That's right.

199
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,660
You can't come up with your own stuff,
so you steal other people's?

200
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,022
You're nothing but a hack.

201
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,854
Are you through,
because I've gotta get back to work.

202
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,226
I'll tell you what I'll do.

203
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,733
If you wanna do it out of town, okay.
But not in the city.

204
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,905
The next time your car breaks down,
take that out of town.

205
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,904
- Fine.
- Good.

206
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,355
George!

207
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,529
What are you doing?

208
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,392
I'm...

209
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,161
...you know...

210
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,169
...pleasuring you.

211
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,898
Well, stop it.

212
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,474
- You don't like the move?
- No, I don't.

213
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,375
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

214
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,213
It feels like aliens
poking at my body.

215
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,779
Sorry.

216
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,517
I'll just go back to my usual routine.

217
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,728
Oh, God. Oh, God, Dave!

218
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,266
Oh, yes, yes.

219
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,301
- I'm sorry.
- What?

220
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,496
I can't do the move.

221
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,039
- What?
- He's ruined it for me.

222
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,368
- Oh, come on. Please?
- No, he called me a hack.

223
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,208
I'm just not into doing it anymore.

224
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,213
So that's it?

225
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,883
I'll come up with some new stuff.

226
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:14,062
<i>"Call me. 36-24-46.
I think I have what you're looking for."</i>

227
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,442
I must caution you about one thing:

228
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,978
You can't cry for at least 10 days.
You can ruin the operation.

229
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,173
Oh, okay.

230
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,545
Now, is someone coming
to pick you up?

231
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:38,156
Yes, my son's friend
should be here any minute.

232
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,934
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, Dr. Cosmo Kramer. Proctology.

233
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,073
- Okay. Sure, doctor.
- Thanks. Have a good day.

234
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,581
I just can't get over
how fantastic you look.

235
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,479
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,552
This takes 20 years off.

237
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,555
And it was all done by laser.
I don't even need bandages.

238
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,592
Yo, Assman. Look at the Assman.

239
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,059
- Did he say, " Assman"?
- Yeah.

240
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,721
Oh, my goodness.

241
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,561
- Hey, the Assman's in town.
- You got that straight.

242
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,567
Boy, I never dreamed
it could make such a difference.

243
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,257
Well, you must have done
something wrong.

244
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,384
You probably screwed up the order.
Did you close with the swirl?

245
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,827
You're supposed to close
with the swirl?

246
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,692
Oh, my God.
Yes, you close with the swirl.

247
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,100
There's a progression there.
I told you to write it down.

248
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,503
Yeah, yeah.
Should've written it down.

249
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,266
<i>- Yeah?
- Elaine.</i>

250
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,434
All right.

251
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,040
Do me a favor.
Don't even do the move anymore.

252
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,081
You're gonna give it a bad name.

253
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,282
Hello.

254
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,421
Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

255
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,451
What? $2800?

256
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,685
That's the estimate on my car?

257
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,456
No, don't even do anything.

258
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,691
I'm gonna think about it.
Okay, bye.

259
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,928
What's to think about?
Puddy's not gonna cheat you.

260
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,368
- Except it's not Puddy.
- What happened to Puddy?

261
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,236
We had a fight about the move.
I took it to this other place.

262
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,072
- I think they're trying to screw me.
- Of course they're trying to screw you.

263
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,579
That's what they do.
They can make up anything.

264
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,773
Nobody knows.

265
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,748
"By the way, you need
a new Johnson rod in here."

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,549
"Oh, Johnson rod? Yeah, well,
better put one of those on."

267
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,919
- Hey, Elaine.
- Yeah, yeah, hello.

268
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,997
- Was it something I said?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

269
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,395
David Puddy won't
do the move anymore.

270
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:03,992
Really?

271
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,627
He's come up with some other move.
You should see this thing.

272
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,069
- What is it?
- It's a lot of just fancy stuff.

273
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,302
You know what it's like?

274
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,939
It's like big-budget movie
with a story that goes nowhere.

275
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,714
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry.
It's just taking up a lot of my time.

276
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:29,384
And I will not stand by and allow him
to perform this move on me...

277
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,429
...while a perfectly good move is
just sitting in the barn doing nothing.

278
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,498
Let me ask you a question.
This new move...

279
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,202
...is there a knuckle involved
in any way?

280
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,805
Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact
there is.

281
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,569
I think that's mine.

282
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,273
I'm not surprised.

283
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,586
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

284
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,618
When's the next time
you're gonna see him?

285
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,257
- Why?
- Get an estimate on my car from him.

286
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,949
This garage is trying to screw me.

287
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,617
An estimate?
How am I supposed to do that?

288
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,230
Look, here's the work order
with everything that broke.

289
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,856
Just kind of bring it up
at the right time and find out.

290
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,801
What? What is this?

291
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,563
That's fusilli Jerry.

292
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,639
- Fusilli Jerry?
- Yeah, Kramer made it.

293
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,981
- All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
- All right.

294
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,115
- Hey, Assman.
- Hey.

295
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,880
- Well, this is Sally.
- Hello.

296
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,585
- Shall we go? All right.
- Okay.

298
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,829
You can't face the fact
that I'm improving myself.

299
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,264
You're not the only one
improving yourself.

300
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,534
I worked out with a dumbbell
yesterday.

301
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,234
I feel vigorous.

302
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,841
Just take your mail and go home.
I have things to do.

303
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,951
I got things to do too.

304
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,555
Don't upset me. I can't cry!

305
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,059
Getting an eye job like some
Manhattanite, huh?

306
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,557
Well, it's already working.
Kramer made a pass at me.

307
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,221
Kramer made a pass at you?
You're crazy.

308
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm not crazy.
He stopped short and made a grab.

309
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,464
He stopped short? That's my move.

310
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,032
I'm gonna kill him.

311
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,974
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
- Sure.

312
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,684
What do you charge
for blown shocks?

313
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,188
- What?
- Two-, 300?

314
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,093
I don't know, maybe 500.

315
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,636
- What about a bad gasket?
- Bad gasket?

316
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,902
Yeah, like a terrible gasket.

317
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,305
- What is all this?
- Nothing, nothing.

318
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,474
I'm just taking an interest
in what you do.

319
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,617
What kind of car is it?

320
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,283
Any kind of a Swedish car.

321
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,751
All together that could run
about 1600.

322
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,627
Is that with the parts and labor?

323
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,672
No. Dave, no, please.
Not the knuckle.

324
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,744
Well...

325
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,311
...that was great.

326
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,349
I mean...

327
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,781
It just came to me.

328
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,630
I've never in my life- I've-
What was that?

329
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,465
You mean in the end?

330
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,664
A counterclockwise swirl.

331
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,933
- What's that?
- What?

332
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,906
- On your hand? Let me see.
- Nothing. I don't know. It's a mole.

333
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,545
- Let me see.
- Just a little dirt.

334
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,045
I wanna see what's on your hand.
Give me your hand.

335
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,274
"Number one, take her leg-"

336
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:17,889
Oh, my God. Crib notes?
You've got crib notes?

337
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,720
It's a very complicated move.
I couldn't remember it all.

338
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,795
Oh, my God, you're sick.

339
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,262
You know, it's not the SATs.

340
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,307
Assman? I'll give him Assman!

341
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,843
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all?

342
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,850
They are ripping me off.

343
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,854
- So, what are you gonna do?
- That's it. I'm going back to Puddy.

344
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,389
No move is worth this.

345
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,459
You don't care
if he does the move anymore?

346
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,460
Are you kidding? He could do
every move I've ever done.

347
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,657
Do you know what a good mechanic is
worth? You can't compare that to sex.

348
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,263
- Hi, Mr. Costanza, what's -?
- Where's your friend, Kramer?

349
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,771
- I don't know, why?
- I'm looking for him, that's why.

350
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,035
- He stopped short.
- What do you mean?

351
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,342
In the car with my wife.
He stopped short.

352
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,310
You think I don't know
what that's about?

353
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,006
That's my own move.
I used it on Estelle 40 years ago.

354
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,017
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows...

355
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,212
...I stop short.

356
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,722
Really? Stopping short?
That's a good move.

357
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,259
You're not kidding
it's a good move.

358
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,896
- Hey.
- Hey, Frank.

359
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,465
Don't "Frank" me. I know what you did.
How dare you stop short with my wife?

360
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,569
Come on, Frank, relax. I don't know
what you're talking about.

361
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,865
You think I don't know, Assman?

362
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,104
To think I almost split the profits
on the Mansiere with you.

363
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,505
- Bro.
- Mansiere!

364
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,145
- Bro!
- Mansiere!

365
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,348
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,230
If I wasn't there,
I wouldn't have believed it.

367
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,299
Me either.

368
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,499
They say this guy's the best.

369
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,169
He had to use corkscrew pasta.

370
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,109
Jerry, Jerry, come here.
Take a look at this.

371
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,049
The name on the boat.
Look at it.

372
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,023
- Assman!
- Yeah, he's the Assman.

373
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,955
Jerry, he's the Assman.

374
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,653
- Which one is the son?
- I am.

375
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,058
I'm Dr. Cooperman.

376
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:45,329
I just want you to know that this won't
take long and he's going to be fine.

377
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:51,241
Excuse me, you didn't by any chance
recently get the wrong license plates?

378
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,346
Yes, I'm still waiting for the Motor
Vehicle Bureau to straighten it out.

379
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,982
So you're the Assman.

380
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,846
<i>Million- 1 shot, doc. Million- 1.</i>

381
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,298
Where have you been?
You were supposed to fix the stove.

382
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,498
I've been waiting for hours.

383
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,143
I fell on some fusilli.

384
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,641
- Fusilli?
- You know, the corkscrew pasta.

385
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,614
It was a fusilli Jerry.

386
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,243
It got stuck in me.
I had to go to the proctologist.

387
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,323
The proctologist? Are you okay?

388
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,086
- Yeah.
- Oh, I was so worried.

389
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,388
- Ma, don't cry!
- Oh, I can't help it!

390
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,589
Ma, your eyes!
