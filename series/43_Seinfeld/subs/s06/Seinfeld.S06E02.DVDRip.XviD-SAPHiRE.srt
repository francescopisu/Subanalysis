1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,068
I find it fascinating, when you go
in the stationery store...

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,199
...that they're manufacturing
millions of pens constantly.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,971
We're all buying them. I must have
bought 6000 Bics in my life.

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,240
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,384
Move a refrigerator,
there's a couple there.

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,851
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,287
That's why it's embarrassing
if you don't have one.

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,689
"You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen?"
We always have to whisper...

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,229
...because it's so humiliating.
"I don't have a pen."

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,556
"They're making millions
of them every week."

11
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,032
"I know. Where are they?"

12
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,444
May I help you?

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,207
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,718
- It's a mechanical pencil.
- Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,758
No, I'm sure you do.

16
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,916
They're pretty expensive.

17
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,085
Well, it's for my boss.

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,753
What do you do?

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,897
Whatever.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,059
Well, we don't have any
in stock right now...

21
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,704
...but I would be happy
to order it for you.

22
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,806
Just give me your phone number...

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,772
...and when it comes in,
I'll give you a call.

24
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,605
Your name is...?

25
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,246
Elaine.

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,314
Elaine.

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,451
- And your last name?
- It's just Elaine. Like Cher.

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,118
And your number?

29
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:39,322
It's KL5-2390.

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,759
Okay. Thanks a lot.

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,132
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Okay. So long.

32
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,604
- Why did you give him my number?
- Don't worry about it.

33
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,771
I think he got ideas.

34
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,107
I wonder if any woman
ever said that about Einstein.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,941
Just call me when
the pencil comes in.

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,550
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer
a pencil to a pen anyway?

37
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,647
Hey, look who's here.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,811
Hey.

39
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,116
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Julie.

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,554
Elaine, Julie.

41
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,059
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,494
Mine's Ike.

43
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,195
Hey, wanna get some lunch?

44
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,632
Just had a big bowl of Kix.

45
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,296
Oh, well, that's very mature.

46
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,338
- What about you?
- Oh, please come, Elaine.

47
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,568
No. Maybe you could
bring me back something.

48
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,339
- Sure, all right. What do you want?
- I don't know.

49
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,415
- A big salad.
- What big salad?

50
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,051
- I'm going to the coffee shop.
- They have big salads.

51
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,982
I've never seen a big salad.

52
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,417
They have big salads.

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,491
Is that what I ask for,
the big salad?

54
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,556
- It's okay. Just forget it.
- No, hey, I'll get it.

55
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,664
What's in the big salad?

56
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,098
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.

57
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,769
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.

58
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,497
- Okay.
- Okay.

59
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,008
Maybe I should just get married.

60
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,204
Dating really is getting
embarrassing, isn't it?

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,113
I know. Whenever I'm on a date,
I always feel like people can tell.

62
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,617
People on dates shouldn't be
allowed out in public.

63
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,846
It's embarrassing for them.

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,650
It's painful for us to watch.

65
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,622
I'm going out with someone later,
I'm not even taking her out.

66
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,854
- Good for you.
- I don't need people staring at us.

67
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,965
You're telling me.

68
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,931
What was that?

69
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,637
Gendason. What a jerk.

70
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,937
I'm never playing golf
with him again.

71
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,104
- Who? Gendason?
- Steve Gendason.

72
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,874
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

73
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,817
- He used to be a baseball player.
- How'd you end up golfing with him?

74
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,853
I met him on the course
a couple years ago.

75
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,322
Yeah. Played with him a lot.
But today was it.

76
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,394
We're on the 15th hole.

77
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,758
He's beating me by a couple
of strokes.

78
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,423
Then he's about to hit
his second shot...

79
00:03:55,602 --> 00:04:01,063
...when he picks up the ball
and cleans it.

80
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,903
- So what?
- Sorry.

81
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,907
The rules clearly state you cannot
clean the ball unless it's on the green.

82
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,813
- The rules are clear about that.
- Certainly are.

83
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,921
- So I penalized him a stroke.
- So, what happened?

84
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,023
He lost it!

85
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,014
We almost came to blows.

86
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,320
We're face to face,
like a manager and an umpire.

87
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,986
We're like,
"Hey, what are you talking about?!

88
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:30,227
- Think I'm gonna put up with that?!"
- All right. All right! You're in my face.

89
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,095
I don't see what the big deal is.

90
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:37,767
Hey, a rule is a rule. And let's face it,
without rules, there's chaos.

91
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,411
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.

92
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,175
Don't you like Safire?

93
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,285
Safire.

94
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,444
Although at times
he can be rather pedantic.

95
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,954
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.

96
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,952
And Bob Herbert's great.

97
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,527
<i>He worked for the Daily News.</i>

98
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,722
Yes. Yes.
You know what's interesting?

99
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,266
The quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons...

100
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,133
...is Bobby Hebert, no R...

101
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,672
...which I find fascinating.

102
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,999
You know, it's Herbert...

103
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,873
...H-E-R-B-E-R-T...

104
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:18,416
...Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.

105
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,148
Hebert. It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it. Hebert.

106
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,181
Go ahead, take a shot. Hebert.
All right.

107
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,293
- Thanks. I got it.
- No. I'd like to pay.

108
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,361
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.

109
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,021
What difference does it make
who pays? It's meaningless.

110
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,168
- Okay, thanks, George.
- Here's your big salad to go.

111
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,133
Oh, thank you.

112
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,339
Hello.

113
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,170
No, she's not here.

114
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,505
Okay, fine. Whatever.

115
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,444
Yes, I'll tell her.

116
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,311
Okay, goodbye.

117
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:57,388
Stationery-store guy called
to say he ordered your pencil.

118
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,015
I told you. He has ideas.

119
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,889
He doesn't even care
if a man answers.

120
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,053
Or you.

121
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,866
- Hey.
- Hey.

122
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,399
Hey.

123
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,127
- Sorry we're late.
- It's no problem.

124
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,795
- Here's your big salad.
- Thank you, Julie.

125
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,531
You're very welcome.

126
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,871
So I guess I better get going.

127
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,377
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?

128
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,539
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.

129
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,548
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. You go.

130
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,779
- Okay, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

131
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,860
Did you see
what just happened here?

132
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,691
Well, that all depends.

133
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,467
Did you happen to notice that Julie
handed the big salad to Elaine?

134
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,033
- Yeah, so?
- Well, she didn't buy the big salad.

135
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,869
I bought the big salad.

136
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,835
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

137
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,810
She just took credit for my salad.

138
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,449
- That's not right.
- No, it isn't.

139
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,278
- I'm the one who bought it.
- You did.

140
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,511
- She should've said something.
- She could have.

141
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,382
- Oh, I know.
- Imagine...

142
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,356
...her taking credit
for your big salad.

143
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,029
You buy a big salad for somebody,
it would be nice if they knew it.

144
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,166
Obviously.

145
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,162
- Turn on the TV.
- What?

146
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,360
Put it on. Put it on!

147
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,270
<i>Neither the district attorney's office
nor the police department...</i>

148
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,433
<i>...have answered
any questions as yet.</i>

149
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,544
<i>To repeat,
in case you're just joining us...</i>

150
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,647
<i>...former baseball star
Steve Gendason has been taken...</i>

151
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,807
<i>...to police headquarters
for questioning...</i>

152
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,545
<i>...in the murder of Bobby Pinkus,
the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners...</i>

153
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,054
<i>...at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue.</i>

154
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,749
<i>According to Pinkus' wife...</i>

155
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,828
<i>...Gendason had been involved
in a dispute with the cleaner...</i>

156
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,397
<i>...over a stain on a pair
of gray Sansabelt slacks.</i>

157
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,994
<i>We also have a report that
earlier in the day...</i>

158
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,536
<i>...a groundskeeper at
Van Cortlandt golf course...</i>

159
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:58,643
<i>...reportedly saw an irate Gendason
leaving the clubhouse in a huff.</i>

160
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,507
<i>Whether there is a possible
connection between the two...</i>

161
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,411
<i>...is something we'll just have
to wait and find out.</i>

162
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,452
- Jerry.
- Well, it had nothing to do with you.

163
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,089
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad
from the penalty stroke...

164
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,849
...that he murdered the dry cleaner.

165
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,693
Generally speaking,
you don't need any extra incentive...

166
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,767
...to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.

167
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,874
- I like Julie. She's very personable.
- Yeah, she's lovely.

168
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
- That's great, George.
- Yeah.

169
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:45,515
- So did you enjoy your lunch?
- Yeah. The big salad.

170
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,024
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.

171
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,030
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

172
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,463
Because, you know,
she handed you the bag.

173
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,361
I could have handed you the bag.

174
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,737
But she happened to picked it up
at the restaurant, even though...

175
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,810
Even though what?

176
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,774
It's just...

177
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,439
You thanked her, even though...

178
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,615
What's the difference?

179
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,051
What? What are you
trying to say, George?

180
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,683
It's just that I was the one
that actually paid for the big salad.

181
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,422
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.

182
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,759
You want the money
for the big salad, George?

183
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,799
- No, no.
- Then what is your problem?

184
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,960
There is no problem.

185
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,208
Just a small miscommunication
whereby you thanked her...

186
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,605
...instead of the person
actually responsible...

187
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,576
...for the purchasing
of the big salad.

188
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,315
Kramer played golf with him,
and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke...

189
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,852
...may have driven him to it.

190
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,124
Well, they haven't even
arrested him yet.

191
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,522
Come on. Let's go out.

192
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,890
No, I don't think so.

193
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,788
Why not?

194
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,457
We don't need a bunch of people
staring at us.

195
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,998
- Who's staring?
- Oh, they're staring.

196
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,196
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.

197
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,102
Come on. It's embarrassing.

198
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,937
Hello?

199
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,940
No, she's not here.

200
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,106
Yes, I will tell her.

201
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,918
No, I don't know what time
she might be coming back.

202
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,681
Look, I gotta go.

203
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,258
Bye.

204
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,088
That's... It's a long story.

205
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,498
Hello, Newman.

206
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,168
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew...

207
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,395
- ...where Kramer was.
- No, I don't. Why?

208
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,473
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?

209
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,336
- I suppose.
- What did Kramer say?

210
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,105
- I don't know. Nothing.
- Come on, Jerry.

211
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,044
You know something.
Tell me! Tell me!

212
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,615
Oh, Chunkys.

213
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,185
Margaret?

214
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,529
- Hello.
- You two know each other?

215
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,856
You might say that.

216
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,999
We used to go out.

217
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,098
Well, toodle-loo.

218
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,143
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.

219
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,212
Have fun.

220
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,450
You went out with Newman?

221
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,591
- Just a few times.
- Why?

222
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:43,398
- I liked him.
- You liked Newman?

223
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,699
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable
talking about this, okay?

224
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,309
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?

225
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,775
He ended it.

226
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,979
He ended it?

227
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,913
Yes. Yes.

228
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,250
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?

229
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,392
No. No, of course not.

230
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,328
Jerry, they found a tee.

231
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,896
- What tee?
- A golf tee in the dry cleaner.

232
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,276
Newman.
She went out with Newman.

233
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,072
- It must be a mistake.
- No. It isn't.

234
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,240
And the most distressing part
is not that she went out with him...

235
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,784
...but that he stopped seeing her.

236
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,487
Do you understand?
He, Newman...

237
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,182
...Newman stopped seeing her.

238
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,952
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.

239
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,757
Newman will see
whoever is willing to see him.

240
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,332
So the question, then, is not
so much why did she see him...

241
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,563
...as disturbing as that is...

242
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,936
...but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?

243
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,976
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.

244
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,748
No. There's less.

245
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,016
- It's possible.
- No, it isn't.

246
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,123
I've looked into his eyes.

247
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,282
He's pure evil.

248
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.

249
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,829
Yeah. He's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.

250
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,932
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- No, but thank you.

251
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,130
By the way, your stationery-store guy
called. He's got your pencil.

252
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,100
You are kidding me.

253
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:35,008
No. He left the store early, made a
special trip to the distributor and got it.

254
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,479
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.

255
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,141
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.

256
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,447
- I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
- You better go down and tell this guy.

257
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,750
- He's very excited.
- Oh, boy.

258
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,550
- Oh, hi, Julie.
- Hi.

259
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,558
- Hi, Julie.
- How are you, Elaine?

260
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,994
- I'm meeting George here.
- Well, then I better get going.

261
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,191
Otherwise George will make me
buy him lunch...

262
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,893
...to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.

263
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,670
How do you know that?

264
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,573
- Who is it?
- It's Jerry.

265
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,180
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?

266
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,839
Come on, Newman, open the door!

267
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,324
Hello, Jerry.

268
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,120
What a rare treat. What brings you
down to the east wing?

269
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,424
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?

270
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,091
Don't get excited.
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?

271
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,036
No, we can't. My skin is crawling
just being inside your little rat's nest.

272
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,300
- Now, what happened?
- You wanna know what happened?

273
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,708
I'll tell you what happened.

274
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,145
She wasn't my type.

275
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,417
- Not your type?
- Not really.

276
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,613
- Well, how come?
- She just didn't do it for me.

277
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,227
- What is wrong with her?
- Well, if you're happy with her...

278
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,488
...that's all that matters.

279
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,792
- You don't think she's attractive?
- No.

280
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,695
I need a really pretty face.

281
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,897
But, hey, that's me.

282
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,005
Okay, Newman. Thanks a lot.

283
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,338
- Care for some lemonade?
- No, thank you.

284
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,414
Drop by anytime, Jerry.

285
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,983
Jerry. All right, now, listen to this.

286
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,023
"If a player cleans his ball
during play of a hole...

287
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:32,789
...except on the putting green,
he shall incur a penalty of one stroke."

288
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,956
- That's the rule.
- It's just a friendly game.

289
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:39,070
- Why are you always such a stickler?
- That's the way I was raised.

290
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,503
When I was growing up,
I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.

291
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:47,078
And if I wasn't... Well, I don't have
to tell you what happened.

292
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,942
What are you so worried
about this for?

293
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,346
You know he talked about Pinkus
on the course?

294
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,747
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,151
He said he brought his pants to
Pinkus', and they came back stained...

296
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,690
...with some kind
of dry-cleaning fluid.

297
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,986
And Pinkus denied responsibility.

298
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,925
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.

299
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,962
So it had nothing to do with you.

300
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,531
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him
over the edge.

301
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,899
- No, I don't think so.
- Poor Pinkus.

302
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,698
Poor little Pinkus.

303
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,704
Hey, let me ask you a question.

304
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,472
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?

305
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,850
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup? I like that.

306
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,714
Yeah. And the curls?
You like the curls?

307
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,448
- Oh, I love curls.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

308
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,353
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?

309
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,585
- Gendason's.
- You're going to see Gendason?

310
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,889
It's weighing on my conscience.

311
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,667
I think I could have played with dolls
if there were dolls in the house.

312
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,697
It seems like fun to me.

313
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:52,401
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.

314
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,508
What's so terrible?

315
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,674
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before-

316
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,715
We're just friends.

317
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,382
Yes, well, anyway, she said something
that was kind of intriguing.

318
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,853
Share.

319
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,586
Well, when I came over to the table,
she mentioned something...

320
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,323
...about how she'd better hurry up and
leave or you'd make her buy lunch...

321
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,592
...to make up for the one
you bought yesterday.

322
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,335
I'm not following.

323
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,135
Well, my question is, how could Elaine
be under the impression...

324
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,436
...that you bought the big salad...

325
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,637
...when I was the one
that handed it to her?

326
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,208
Well, she probably just assumed.

327
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,115
Did she?

328
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,684
Wait a second.

329
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,558
Are you suggesting that I went
out of my way to tell Elaine...

330
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,791
...that even though you handed her
the big salad, that it came from me?

331
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,958
That's what I'm suggesting.

332
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,704
Well, it was a big salad.

333
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,666
And what I would like to know
is how does a person...

334
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,642
...who has virtually nothing
to do with the big salad...

335
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,044
...claim responsibility
for that salad...

336
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:08,414
...and accept a thank-you
under false pretenses?

337
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,915
George, all I did was
hand someone a bag.

338
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,398
It's just that my boss
is very demanding...

339
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,627
...and he needed the pencil
right away.

340
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,465
Well, why did you tell me
to order it if you knew...

341
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,107
...you were going to get one
some place else?

342
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,835
No, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

343
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,343
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.

344
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,744
It took me three hours.

345
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,146
I had a big fight with the foreman.

346
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,977
Really? A fight with the foreman?

347
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:49,287
- Yes.
- Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.

348
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,951
Yeah?

349
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,966
Well, then how about
going out with me?

350
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,496
Okay.

351
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,504
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.

352
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,237
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners'
with a tee.

353
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,410
The circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

354
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,076
You had how many dates with him?
Three?

355
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,146
Around three. I don't know.

356
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,086
And...?

357
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,752
I told you, he stopped calling me.

358
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,763
I moved on. I'm not hung up on him.

359
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:35,062
- What are you looking at?
- What? I'm not looking. Nothing.

360
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,236
Why are you looking at my face?

361
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,169
Where am I gonna look?

362
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,247
Kiss me.

363
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,086
I can't.

364
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,157
Newman.

365
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,262
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of...

366
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:11,205
...when I was looking at her face was,
"Newman found this unacceptable."

367
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,875
I'm going out
with the stationery-store guy.

368
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,310
You're going out
with the stationery-store guy?

369
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,613
I felt so guilty about the pencil
I couldn't say no.

370
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,026
Well, well, well.

371
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,163
I'm not treating you
to lunch anymore!

372
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,264
You had to tell Julie that I made
a special point of telling you...

373
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,961
...that I bought you
the big salad, didn't you?

374
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,410
You know, if it was a regular salad,
I wouldn't have said anything.

375
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,172
But you had to have the big salad!

376
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,681
Hello?

377
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,321
What?

378
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,922
You're kidding.

379
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,718
I'm turning it on.

380
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,622
Oh, my God, get out of here.

381
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,097
Hey, listen to this. They issued
a warrant for Gendason's arrest.

382
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,032
He escaped, and the police spotted
him on the New Jersey Turnpike.

383
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:15,230
<i>As you can see,
he's in a white Ford Bronco.</i>

384
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,841
<i>The police have cleared
the highway traffic in front...</i>

385
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,705
<i>...but they are keeping
their distance.</i>

386
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,210
<i>They don't want this situation
to escalate.</i>

387
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,613
<i>And we have gotten an identification
on the driver of the vehicle.</i>

388
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,514
<i>His name is Kramer...</i>

389
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,214
<i>...and he's reportedly one
of Gendason's golfing buddies.</i>

390
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,190
<i>911, what are you reporting?</i>

391
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,989
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.

392
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,825
Now, he wants to see his fish.

393
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,730
I'm taking him to see his fish,
so tell the police to back off.

394
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,030
<i>Okay, sir. And what's your name?</i>

395
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,606
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!

396
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,904
- I told you not to take the turnpike.
- I thought we would blend in.

397
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,207
If you took the Palisades,
this wouldn't happen.

398
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:01,045
- Then we would've had bridge traffic.
- Just drive.

399
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,529
To me, murder doesn't even really
seem like that great of a revenge.

400
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:17,226
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological
mind games be a lot more satisfying?

401
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,633
Constantly calling them and hanging
up when they pick up the phone.

402
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,173
Sending pizzas and taxis
to their house all night long.

403
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,938
After a while they go, "I wish this guy
would kill me. I can't take it anymore!"

404
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,776
How come when the police
catch some really bad criminal...

405
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,681
...they put him in the handcuffs,
hit him with the baton...

406
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,290
...put the chokehold on him, but then
they don't want him to hurt his head...

407
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,824
...when they're putting him
in the patrol car.

408
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:46,487
"Watch your head. Don't hit that
metal edge there. That really hurts."
