1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,770
Buying shoes is a challenge.
Ever see someone put on new shoes?

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,398
They turn into a zombie as they start
walking around the store.

3
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,971
"Yeah, these are pretty good."

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,183
Then they have that
little 1-foot-high mirror.

5
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,016
What is that about? So I can see
what cats will think of my shoes?

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,714
What is that angle?

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,827
Bum passed out on the curb,
"Hey, what do you think of these?

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,064
I just got them. I've seen them
from that angle myself."

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,603
That guy was amazing.
He could dunk. And he was my height.

10
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,838
- What was his name again?
- Jimmy.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,606
- Jimmy. Right.
- I don't know how you could forget.

12
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,944
He kept referring to himself
in the third person.

13
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,053
"Jimmy's under the boards.
Jimmy's in the open.

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,883
Jimmy makes the shot."

15
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,786
You're just mad
because we beat you.

16
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,052
Jerry, it's my fault.
I couldn't make a shot.

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,994
These losses stay with me.
They fester, Jerry.

18
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,199
No, this is gonna plague me.

19
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,401
Hey, Jimmy.

20
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,709
- Great game.
- Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,107
Jimmy played pretty good.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,551
Hey, you know, I felt like we had
a synergy out there.

23
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,414
- We were really helping each other.
- What do you got there?

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,646
- These?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,155
These are Jimmy's training shoes.

26
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,550
Yeah, I've seen these things.
What, do they-?

27
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:37,491
- They make your legs stronger?
- Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,825
Jimmy couldn't jump at all
before he got these.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,631
Jimmy...

30
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,632
...was like you.

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,930
- They're plyometric.
- Plyometric?

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,008
Yeah, they isolate the muscles.
The muscle has to grow or die.

33
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,079
- Where do you get them?
- Jimmy sells them.

34
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,875
- You sell them?
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,517
But Jimmy's all out right now.

36
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,816
Moving to Manhattan
set Jimmy back a bit.

37
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,150
Let me give you my card.
It's got my home number.

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,725
- I want to buy a pair next shipment.
- All right.

39
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,725
All right, Jimmy,
good talking to you.

40
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,057
- Here you go.
- Jimmy will see you around.

41
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,796
Wait a minute, what day is today?

42
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,904
Oh, Tuesday. Damn it,
I shouldn't have worked out today.

43
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,235
Mr. Wilhelm called a big meeting.
I'm gonna be sweating through it.

44
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,536
- What? You took a shower.
- It wouldn't take.

45
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,281
Ten minutes from now,
I'll be sweating. I can feel it.

46
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,510
- I'm a human heat pump.
- You ought to take cold showers.

47
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,051
Cold showers?

48
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,180
- They're for psychotics.
- Well, I take them.

49
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,286
They give me a whoosh.

50
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,589
- All right. I'll see you guys later.
- All right.

51
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,358
- So, what, you heading home?
- No. Got a dental appointment.

52
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,592
- Tim Whatley?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,202
- Yeah, I got a checkup Thursday.
- How do you like that.

54
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,272
You really shouldn't brush
24 hours before seeing the dentist.

55
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,002
I think that's
"eat 24 hours before surgery."

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,545
Oh, no, you gotta eat
before surgery.

57
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,013
You need your strength.

58
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,756
I've called this meeting
because we have a problem.

59
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,356
For the last few months...

60
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,861
...someone has been stealing
equipment from the club.

61
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,993
Until recently, it's been little things:

62
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,261
Bases, batting helmets, doughnuts.

63
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,203
But two nights ago,
they pulled a big one.

64
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,835
They took a pitching machine,
a batting cage, the infield tarp...

65
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,639
...and all of Mr. Steinbrenner's
vitamins.

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,746
Now, we have reason
to believe it's an inside job.

67
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,610
So if anybody here
knows anything about it...

68
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,952
...I recommend strongly
that you come forward.

69
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,959
Dr. Whatley's running a little late.

70
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,160
Take a seat, I'll call you
when he's ready.

71
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,862
All right.

72
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,760
Oh, okay. Right. Thanks, Mr. Pitt.

73
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,488
Okay. Goodbye.

74
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,101
Hey, you wanna go see
the Velvet Fog?

75
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,133
The Velvet Fog?

76
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,568
Yeah, Mel Tormé.
That's his nickname.

77
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,801
What the hell is a velvet fog?

78
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,305
- Do you wanna go or not?
- Well, where is it?

79
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,413
He's performing
at this AMCA benefit.

80
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,778
- AMCA?
- Able Mentally Challenged Adults.

81
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,577
I can't watch a man sing a song.

82
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,847
What, are you crazy?

83
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,991
They get all emotional, they sway.
It's embarrassing.

84
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,357
Well, what am I gonna do
for a date?

85
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,499
Do you know that blond guy...

86
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,363
...who's always on the Exercycle
at the health club?

87
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,128
- I don't think so.
- No, no, you know.

88
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,241
- He's really handsome, with those-
- Elaine, I really don't...

89
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,944
...pay much attention
to men's faces.

90
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,280
- You can't find beauty in a man?
- No.

91
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,646
I find them repugnant
and unappealing.

92
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,456
- Hey.
- To wit.

93
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,852
What?

94
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,552
Elaine and I were discussing whether
or not I could admit a man is attractive.

95
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,554
Oh, you know, I'll tell you
who's an attractive man:

96
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,632
George Will.

97
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,897
- Really?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,699
Yeah, he has a clean look.
Scrubbed and shampooed and...

99
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,306
He's smart.

100
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,308
No, no, I don't find him
all that bright.

101
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,880
- So you got any cavities?
- Just one.

102
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,447
- Yeah?
- Gotta go back.

103
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,605
Oh, but get this.

104
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,718
- Elaine, you will appreciate this.
- What?

105
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,081
I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's
waiting room...

106
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,985
<i>...he's got a Penthouse
right out on the table.</i>

107
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,149
<i>- Penthouse?
- Yeah, what is that?</i>

108
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,228
Isn't that sick? I'd be embarrassed
to have that in my apartment.

109
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,195
- So, what's wrong with that?
- He's a doctor.

110
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,927
I mean, it's supposed to be,
like, a sterile environment.

111
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,705
So did you take a look?

112
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,004
Of course. But that's
got nothing to do with it.

113
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,614
Well, I'll tell you, I'm looking forward
to my appointment on Thursday.

114
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,478
I might even get there
a few minutes early.

115
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,344
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,856
Hey, listen, do either of you guys
know that blond guy...

117
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,426
...who's always on the Exercycle
at the health club?

118
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,359
You know,
he's just really handsome?

119
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,765
I-I wouldn't know.

120
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,930
You know, just admitting
a man is handsome...

121
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,870
...doesn't necessarily
make you a homosexual.

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,310
It doesn't help.

123
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,776
All right. Never mind.

124
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,473
I'll see you.

125
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,949
Hey, you know those shoes
that Jimmy had?

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,055
I cut a deal with him. We're gonna
import a case of them together.

127
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,556
- What for? You got a job.
- There's a lot of money in this.

128
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,661
He's got a proven sales method.

129
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,626
- Yeah? What's that?
- He jumps.

130
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,991
Jimmy's got a backer.

131
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,063
Jimmy's jumping for dollars.

132
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,896
Jimmy and George
are gonna get rich.

133
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,560
Will you stop with the Jimmys?

134
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,339
- Hey, what is this?
- Kung Pao.

135
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,941
Hot.

136
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,673
Kung Pao!

137
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,651
<i>Look at me.</i>

138
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,485
<i>Look at me.</i>

139
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,988
<i>Come on, I'm stretching
right in front of you.</i>

140
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,253
<i>Hey, a smile.</i>

141
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,025
<i>We made contact.</i>

142
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,395
<i>All right. One more stretch
and then go talk to him.</i>

143
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,766
You know...

144
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,770
...Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.

145
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,283
- He is?
- Oh, yeah.

146
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,442
Jimmy's been watching you.

147
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,886
- You're just Jimmy's type.
- Oh, really?

148
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,427
Jimmy's new in town.
Jimmy doesn't really know anyone.

149
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,560
Oh, well, I'd like to get to know him.

150
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,632
Jimmy would like to get to know you.

151
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,933
You think Jimmy likes Mel Tormé?

152
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,931
Jimmy loves the Velvet Fog.

153
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,269
- Hey, Kramer.
- Well, you're looking sharp there, Tim.

154
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,575
Yeah, well, I do what I can.

155
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,616
- How have you been?
- Oh, fine, good, yeah.

156
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:46,622
I've just been occupying myself
with some of your reading material.

157
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,124
- So, what'll it be? Novocain?
- Yes. Yes, indeed.

158
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,661
- Why don't we clear a path first.
- Let's do that.

159
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,958
- You remember Mr. Thirsty.
- All right.

160
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,745
- You too with these?
- Yeah, I'm onboard.

161
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,974
So, what did Tim say?

162
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,984
Well, he said I gotta
cut out the Skittles.

163
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,056
- Looks like he gave you Novocain.
- Oh, I'm loaded.

164
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,783
<i>What about the Penthouse?
You ask?</i>

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,393
Well, he said that, you know...

166
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,996
...it helps his patients
relax a little bit.

167
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,257
And he's got a new policy:

168
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,900
Adults only.

169
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,099
- Adults only?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,240
- What the hell is going on over there?
- Well, you know, it's great.

171
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,171
You know, no kids allowed.

172
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,039
You don't have to watch
your language.

173
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,878
You find the need to use
obscenities at the dentist?

174
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,252
When they pull that needle out,
I let the expletives fly.

175
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,427
Hey, come on, watch it.

176
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,862
You're drooling on the floor. How
much Novocain did that guy give you?

177
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,230
I can't hold the water.

178
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,366
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Jimmy.

179
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,940
Jimmy's ready.
Jimmy's got some new moves.

180
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,304
- Go, Jimmy.
- Check Jimmy out.

181
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,110
Jimmy's down.

182
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,924
It's pretty bad, man.
Your boy's gonna be in traction.

183
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,620
Jimmy might have
a compound fracture.

184
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,764
Jimmy's going into shock.

185
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:38,097
- Why weren't you more careful?
- Hey, I'm doing the best I can.

186
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,735
Why are you taking it
so personally?

187
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,568
Because if he can't jump,
there goes my sneaker business.

188
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,335
Well, I said I'm sorry.

189
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,139
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer.

190
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,874
Jimmy holds grudges.
Let Jimmy go.

191
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,042
You know, I can't feel anything.

192
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,123
Hey, taxi!

193
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,228
Taxi!

194
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,524
Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead.

195
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,429
You got it. He's got it.

196
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,342
- Please, go ahead.
- No, no, you were here first.

197
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,774
No, please, I insist.

198
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,503
I'll grab the next one.

199
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:27,381
- Let's share. We share, all right?
- Yes, let's. That's a great idea.

200
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,259
My name is Arnold Deensfrei.

201
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,490
- What is your name?
- Cosmo Kramer. It's nice to meet you.

202
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,102
Very nice to meet you, Cosmo.

203
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,204
Are you heading home?

204
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah, heading home.

205
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,532
Good for you.

206
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,373
You're really independent.

207
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,516
Well, you're not
doing too bad yourself.

208
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,314
Anyway, Jimmy
couldn't be here today...

209
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,461
...so he asked me
to fill in for him.

210
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,529
And I'm sure
that you'll be impressed...

211
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,931
...at what can be accomplished
after only a few short days of training.

212
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,003
Here we go.

213
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,347
The Velvet Fog.

214
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,511
- What about the Velvet Fog?
- What about the Velvet Fog?

215
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,886
Well, he's singing at a benefit,
and I'm gonna be sitting at his table.

216
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,661
- I'm going to that.
- Yeah, I'm a guest of honor.

217
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,023
What are you talking about?

218
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,291
Well, this afternoon I shared a cab
with this Deensfrei.

219
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,129
Yeah, yeah, Arnold Deensfrei.
He runs the AMCA.

220
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,670
Well, okay. That's the guy.
He's organizing the dinner.

221
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,466
I know that, but why are you going?

222
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:02,706
Well, because we hit it off, and he was
very impressed with what I do.

223
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,150
What you do?
You don't do anything.

224
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,611
Well, apparently I do something...

225
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,692
...because I'm sitting at the head table
with Mr. Mel Tormé.

226
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,257
What are those?

227
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,598
Oh, these are
my vertical-leap training shoes.

228
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,673
Wait a second. Were you wearing
those shoes in the cab?

229
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,071
Yeah, yeah. Right after I left the Y.

230
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,802
- Don't you see what happened?
- What?

231
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,745
He couldn't talk, he's wearing
these shoes, he's drooling.

232
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,713
What?

233
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,253
He thinks you're
mentally challenged.

234
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,050
Well...

235
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,119
- ...you know.
- What happens when you show up?

236
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,853
He'll see that you're not.

237
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,760
- Not necessarily, because...
- I know, I know.

238
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,463
Cheryl, would you ready
the nitrous oxide, please.

239
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,309
It's good.

240
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,941
Where is Jennifer today?

241
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,781
She's over at Dr. Seisman's office.

242
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,619
Yeah, we find it fun
to swap now and then.

243
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:27,922
Now, you just take some
deep breaths and try to relax.

244
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,351
Oh, man!

245
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,089
It's George.

246
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,229
Oh, Sports Wholesalers, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for calling me back.

247
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,921
No, I still got the shoes.
Still got shoes, lots of them.

248
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,431
Yeah, this is beautiful athletic gear.

249
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,069
I'm sorry, I gotta call you right back.
Yeah. All right.

250
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,237
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- So, George...

251
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,841
...have you heard anything
about the missing equipment?

252
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,807
No, no. Not a thing.

253
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:16,971
You know, George, there's nothing
I hate more than a liar.

254
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,448
Well, there's no room for someone
like that in this organization.

255
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,214
- Are you feeling all right, George?
- Yeah, fine.

256
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,187
You look a little warm.

257
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,655
It's the chicken.

258
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,689
You're a terrible liar, George.
Look at you. You're a wreck.

259
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,423
- You're sweating bullets.
- It's the Kung Pao.

260
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,295
George likes his chicken spicy.

261
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,556
Maybe you were still under the gas.

262
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,495
Maybe you were hallucinating
you were coming out of the gas...

263
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,760
- ...but still under the gas.
- I don't think so.

264
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,836
I think they were getting dressed.

265
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,565
And not only that, my shirt was out.

266
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,709
- Your shirt was out?
- I think so.

267
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,074
- Well, what kind of shirt was it?
- You know, like a tennis shirt.

268
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,414
- You don't tuck those in.
- Sometimes I tuck, sometimes I don't.

269
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,585
- Well, were you tucked?
- I think I was tucked.

270
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,654
All right, say you were. What do you
think could have happened?

271
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,193
I don't know. But I was spitting out and
rinsing like there was no tomorrow.

272
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,497
Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?

273
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,105
- What are you getting?
- I don't think I'm hungry.

274
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,309
Okay, so you were violated
by two people...

275
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,937
...while you were under the gas.
So what?

276
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,711
You're single.

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,881
I'm damaged goods now.

278
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,515
Join the club.

279
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,826
You ever call that guy
from the health club?

280
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,393
Oh, yeah, Jimmy.

281
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,424
Jimmy?

282
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,967
- That's the guy?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,228
I can't believe you're
going out with him.

284
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,599
- Why?
- I don't know, he's so strange.

285
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,062
How so?

286
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,835
Didn't you notice he refers
to himself in the third person?

287
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,137
"Jimmy can dunk.
Jimmy's new in town.

288
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,405
Jimmy will see you later."

289
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,309
No, wait a minute.
That's not him.

290
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,852
That's the guy who gave me
Jimmy's number.

291
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,252
That's Jimmy.

292
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,525
That's the way he talks.

293
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,424
I'm gonna go see Mel Tormé
with him?

294
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,656
Jimmy's gonna put
the moves on Elaine.

295
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,031
So I have to go see
Steinbrenner later.

296
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,606
Wilhelm told him I was responsible
for stealing all the merchandise.

297
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,901
Why?

298
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,945
Because when he questioned me,
I was sweating from the Kung Pao.

299
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,976
I don't know how you could
eat that spicy chicken.

300
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,778
George likes spicy chicken.

301
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,449
What's that?

302
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,780
I like spicy chicken.

303
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,393
No, no, you said,
"George likes spicy chicken."

304
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,892
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

305
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,623
- "George likes spicy chicken."
- You're turning into Jimmy.

306
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,157
George is getting upset.

307
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,699
So, what did you want
to see Jimmy about?

308
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,468
Well, Jimmy, about tonight.

309
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,445
There's been a little
misunderstanding.

310
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,343
Jimmy doesn't like
misunderstandings.

311
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,040
Yeah, well, what happened was-

312
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,210
Jimmy and misunderstandings
kind of clash.

313
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,824
You know, I've never heard
anyone talk the way you do.

314
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,428
- It's very unusual.
- Well, Jimmy's very unusual.

315
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,957
Well, anyway, see, when I made
the date, I thought that Jimmy-

316
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,570
Hey, look, Hank's got
a new boyfriend.

317
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,137
Jimmy's not threatened
by Hank's sexuality.

318
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,898
Jimmy's happy for Hank.

319
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,370
Elaine once tried to convert one...

320
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,706
...but Elaine's not gonna go
through that again.

321
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,051
I'm gonna go and try
and find some candy.

322
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,743
- You want some?
- Yeah.

323
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,548
- What kind?
- I don't care.

324
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,892
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hi, Elaine.

325
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,864
- Elaine got a new dress.
- Jimmy likes it.

326
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,557
There's no candy around here.
Hey, Jimmy.

327
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,330
Well, look who's here.

328
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,133
- That's the guy who sidelined Jimmy.
- What?

329
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,640
That guy took the bread
out of Jimmy's mouth.

330
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,705
Jimmy's out of work
because of you.

331
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,438
- Jimmy wants a piece of Kramer!
- Come on, now.

332
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,311
Get your hands off Jimmy!

333
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,316
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer!

334
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,615
Hands off Jimmy!
Don't touch Jimmy!

335
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,314
Let go of Jimmy!

336
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,619
Yeah, I- Is my lip swollen?

337
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,294
Guy's got a problem.

338
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,699
No, no, I've been living alone
a long time now.

339
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,634
Well, I think that's the tops.

340
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,443
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steinbrenner?

341
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,952
Yes, George, come in, come in.

342
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,680
I've been your biggest supporter...

343
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,826
...and I was disappointed to hear
you've been pilfering equipment.

344
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,689
George would never do
anything like that.

345
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,995
- No, why would I? I own it.
- Right.

346
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,099
So, what are you saying?

347
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,104
Why would George steal
from the Yankees?

348
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,037
- He wouldn't.
- Of course not.

349
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,109
Exactly.

350
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,947
I don't know what the hell
is going on here.

351
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,241
- Sir?
- Nothing.

352
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,745
Well, I was thinking it's time
for George's lunch.

353
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,820
Yes, it is. All right.
Let's see, what do I have today?

354
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,856
Oh, darn it.
It's ham and cheese again.

355
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,256
And she forgot the fancy mustard.
I told her I like that fancy mustard.

356
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,727
You could put that mustard on a shoe
and it would taste pretty good to me.

357
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,490
She made up for it with a cupcake.

358
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,830
I got a new system of eating these.
I used to peel off the chocolate.

359
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,632
Now I eat the cake first
and save the frosting for the end.

360
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,239
It's almost a dessert dessert.

361
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,737
Ladies and gentlemen...

362
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,777
...I wanna dedicate this song
to a very courageous young man.

363
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,318
<i>Hey, got the new Penthouse.</i>

364
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,118
- Where's my Mr. Goodbar?
- Yeah, here you are.

365
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,154
Oh, here, here. Listen.

366
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,762
<i>"Dear Penthouse:</i>

367
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,297
I'd like to tell you about
an experience I recently had.

368
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,094
As an avid reader,
I've always wondered...

369
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,669
- ...if the letters are true.
- If the letters are true.

370
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,568
I'm a dentist, and one afternoon,
my hygienist and I...

371
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,040
...decided to have a little fun
with one of our patients.

372
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:37,739
Of course, none of our patients had
any idea exactly what we were up to.

373
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,615
I was still wondering whether or not
the tools I could use..."
