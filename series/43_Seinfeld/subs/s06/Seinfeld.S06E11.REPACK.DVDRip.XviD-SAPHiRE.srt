1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,834
The Christmas tree seems
to inspire a love-hate relationship.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,204
All that time is spent
selecting it and decorating it...

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,210
...and then a week after,
it's just thrown somewhere.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,406
You see it by the side of the road.
It looks like a mob hit.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,781
The car slows down, the door opens,
and this tree just rolls out.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,049
People snap out of that Christmas
spirit like it was a drunken stupor.

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,023
They just wake up one morning
and go:

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,254
"Oh, my God,
there's a tree inside the house.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,326
Just throw it anywhere."

10
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,875
Ready to go, Lois?

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,873
Boy, you sure like to say my name,
don't you?

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,446
Excuse me, Lois.
Stand back, Lois.

13
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,946
Jimmy's in trouble, Lois.

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,817
Oh, Mr. Meyer,
this is my friend Jerry-

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:58,219
- Jerry Seinfeld.
- Duncan Meyer.

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,916
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,325
We went to high school together,
didn't we, Jerry?

18
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,830
- Yeah, yeah.
- Gee, I hope you're not leaving now.

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,265
We still have a lot of
work left to do.

20
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,905
Would you be able to come
all the way downtown again...

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,631
...in rush hour and pick me up?

22
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,168
Why, I'd have to be Superman
to do that, Lois.

23
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,008
No. No, this is all wrong.

24
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,515
- Where's the chicken cashew?
- You no order chicken cashew.

25
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,244
No, I didn't order any of this.
I'm not paying for this.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,984
Fine, Benes.

27
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,647
We're putting you on our list.

28
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,426
- What list?
- The do-not-deliver list.

29
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,794
Merry Christmas to you.

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,396
- Well, I guess we'll just go out.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,629
<i>What are you doing
with the Daily Worker?</i>

32
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,796
I figure Ned must have left it here.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,442
<i>Your boyfriend reads the Daily
Worker? What is he, a Communist?</i>

34
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,169
He reads everything.
You know, Ned's very well-read.

35
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,315
Maybe he's just very, well, Red.

36
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,688
A Communist? Don't you think
he probably would have told me?

37
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,123
Well, does he wear bland, drab,
olive-colored clothing?

38
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,094
Yes.

39
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,629
Yes, he does dress a little drab.

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,664
He's a Communist.

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,793
Hey, look at this.

42
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,464
"Exciting, uninhibited woman
seeks forward-thinking comrade.

43
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,133
Appearance not important."

44
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,439
Appearance not important?
This is unbelievable.

45
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,982
Finally, this an ideology
I can embrace.

46
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,215
- Where's Lois?
- She couldn't make it.

48
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,914
I can't believe you're going out
with a woman named Lois.

49
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,354
I know. Finally.

50
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,620
But, George,
guess who her boss is?

51
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,559
- Duncan Meyer.
- Duncan Meyer?

52
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,165
- Who's he?
- Elaine...

53
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,733
...only one person knows
what I'm about to tell you...

54
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,461
...and that's George.

55
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,007
In the ninth grade they had us all line
up in the schoolyard for this race...

56
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,841
...to see who would represent
the school in this track meet.

57
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,710
I was the last one on the end, George
was next to me and Mr. Bevilaqua-

58
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,752
- What's that?
- Mr. Bevilaqua, the gym teacher.

59
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,913
- Oh, of course.
- He was down at the other end.

60
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,118
So he yells out, "Ready.
On your mark. Get set..."

61
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,459
And I was so keyed up,
I just took off.

62
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,100
By the time he said, "Go,"
I was ten yards ahead.

63
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,496
- No.
- I looked up.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,035
I couldn't believe it.

65
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,799
By the time the race was over,
I had won. I was shocked.

66
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,340
- Nobody had noticed the head start.
- Really?

67
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,239
Yes. And I had won by so much...

68
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,575
...a myth began to grow
about my speed.

69
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,276
Only Duncan suspected
something was amiss.

70
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,578
He's hated me ever since.

71
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,744
And now he's back.

72
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,480
Well, what happened
when you raced him again?

73
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,387
I never did.

74
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,888
In four years of high school,
I would never race anyone...

75
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,362
...not even to the end of a block
or to catch a bus.

76
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,725
And so the legend grew.

77
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,393
Everyone wanted me to race.
They begged me.

78
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,166
The track coach called my parents,
pleading, telling them it was a sin...

79
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,606
...for me to waste
my God-given talent.

80
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,746
But I answered him in the same way
I answered everyone.

81
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,246
I choose not to run.

82
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,845
So now Duncan is back?

83
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,989
He's back.

84
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,750
As I knew he would be someday.

85
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,697
Man, that's some tart cider.

86
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,068
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,263
- Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
- Oh, so am I.

88
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
How's Duncan?

89
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,074
He's okay.

90
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,310
He say anything?

91
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,942
About what?

92
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,048
Oh, nothing in particular.

93
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,611
- Why did you cheat in that race?
- I did not cheat.

94
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,347
He said that you got a head start.

95
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,357
Oh, he's just jealous
because he came in second.

96
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,494
So you were the fastest kid
in school.

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,301
Faster than a speeding bullet, Lois.

99
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,799
So how was work?
Another day, another dollar?

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,174
- I guess.
- Yeah, well, nothing wrong with that.

101
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,247
Gotta make those big bucks.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,112
Money, money, money.

103
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,912
Are you a Communist?

104
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,655
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

105
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,986
A commie.

106
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,764
Must be a bummer for you guys...

107
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,730
...what with the fall of
the Soviet empire and everything.

108
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,503
Well, yeah. Well,
we still got China, Cuba.

109
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,130
Yeah, but come on.

110
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,410
- I know. It's not the same.
- Well, you had a good run.

111
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,015
I mean, what was it? Seventy-five,
80 years wreaking havoc...

112
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,548
...making everybody nervous.

113
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,412
Yeah, we had a good run.

114
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,283
Well, so enjoy yourself.

115
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,988
So you lied to her?

116
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,823
I couldn't tell her the truth. I don't know
what's gonna happen between us.

117
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,227
If we have a bad breakup,
she'll go to Duncan.

118
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,565
I want him to go to his grave never
being certain that I got that head start.

119
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,436
Well, I'm dating a Communist.

120
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,804
- A Communist? That's something.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool, isn't it?

121
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,710
Hey, I called one of those girls...

122
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,613
<i>...from the personal ads
in the Daily Worker.</i>

123
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,286
<i>- The Daily Worker has personals?
- Yeah.</i>

124
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,050
And they say that appearance
is not important.

125
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,217
Yours or hers?

126
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,196
Merry Christmas, everyone.

127
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,664
- Merry Christmas.
- Well, look at you.

128
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,393
- You got the job.
- You're looking...

129
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,767
...at the new Santa
at Coleman's Department Store.

130
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,703
- All right. Way to go.
- Congratulations.

131
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,106
Yeah. Feel that, isn't it great?

132
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,575
Look, it's Mickey.

133
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,042
Come on. Get your beard on.
We're gonna be late.

134
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,482
On Prancer. On Dasher.
On Donna.

135
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,518
It's not Donna. It's Donner.

136
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,156
- It's Donna.
- Right. On Prancer.

137
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,383
On Dancer. On Ethel. On Harriet.

138
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,232
Hello. Oh, hi, Lois.

139
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,368
He wants to get together?
What for?

140
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,539
I don't know about that.
I'll have to think about it.

141
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,937
- I'll let you know. Okay. Bye.
- What's up?

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,101
Duncan wants to get together
with me and her.

143
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,440
He's gonna try to get me
to admit I got a head start.

144
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,206
I don't think she believes me.

145
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,975
He wants to meet you?

146
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,552
I'll tell you what. I'll show up.
He doesn't know we're friends.

147
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,781
I'll pretend I haven't seen you
since school. I'll back up the story.

148
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,755
- That's not bad.
- Not bad?

149
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,622
It's gorgeous.

150
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,164
Well, come on, little princess,
tell Santa what you want.

151
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,671
- Don't be shy.
- She doesn't speak English.

152
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,673
Oh, Santa speaks the language
of all children.

153
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,384
Hey, Mickey, when do we get a break?
My lap is killing me.

154
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,321
- There is no break.
- This is like a sweatshop.

155
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,860
- Kramer.
- Hey, hey, hey.

156
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,830
There's a Natalie on line two.

157
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,766
<i>- Natalie?
- From the Daily Worker.</i>

158
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,836
Thank you.

159
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,880
Hello. Yes, Natalie.

160
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:42,017
Well, yes, this is a business office,
but I'm not a businessman per se.

161
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,656
I'm here working for the people.

162
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,020
Yes, I'm causing dissent...

163
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,392
...stirring the pot, getting people
to question the whole rotten system.

164
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,527
- Elaine.
- Arlene.

165
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,034
- Hi.
- Hello.

166
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,867
- Doing a little Christmas shopping?
- Yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,305
Oh, this is Ned.
He's a Communist.

168
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,838
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,741
Big Communist.
Big, big Communist.

170
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,850
- It was awfully nice to see you.
- Yeah, see you later.

171
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,952
- Okey-dokey. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

172
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,610
Listen, as long as we're here...

173
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,382
...what do you say we do
a little shirt-shopping?

174
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,717
Out of the question.

175
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,093
- Kramer.
- Oh, hi.

176
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,389
Hi. Hi, Mickey. How are you?

177
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,430
- This is Ned.
- Oh, hey.

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,067
How are you doing there, buddy?

179
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,295
Hey, you guys stay here, okay?
I'll be right back. Right back.

180
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,473
Eight hours of jingle-belling
and ho-ho-hoing.

181
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,404
Boy, I am hoed out.

182
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,377
- Anyone who works here is a sap.
- Hey, watch it, pal.

183
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,377
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Come on, come on.

184
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,709
What's the matter with you?

185
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,082
The Santas at Bloomfields are making
double what you are.

186
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,314
- Double?
- I bet the glue from that beard itches.

187
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,718
You've got that straight.

188
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,052
So when you get a rash
all over your face...

189
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,752
...you think Coleman's will be there
with a medical plan?

190
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,262
Look, you take that commie crap
out to the street.

191
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,164
I've got literature in my car that will
change your whole way of thinking.

192
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,998
- Talk to me.
- Don't listen to him.

193
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,639
You've got a good job here.

194
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,466
There's just no way you could've
beaten me by that much.

195
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,340
I had already beaten you
in junior high school three times.

196
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,744
I didn't hit puberty
till the ninth grade.

197
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,985
That's what gave me my speed.

198
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,617
Besides, if I got a head start, why
didn't Mr. Bevilaqua stop the race?

199
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,282
- That's what I've always wondered.
- Well...

200
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,065
Oh, my God.

201
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,903
No. Oh, my God.

202
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,001
Jerry.

203
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,808
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,774
George.

205
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:51,247
- George Costanza.
- Oh, George Costanza.

206
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,784
- Kennedy High.
- Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,923
- This is unbelievable.
- Hi, George.

208
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,224
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

209
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,832
It starts with a... Duncan.

210
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,591
That's right.

211
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,828
Wow, this is something. I haven't
seen you guys in, what, 20 years?

212
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,197
- This is Lois.
- Hi, there.

213
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,003
What have you been doing
with yourself?

214
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,702
Well, I'm a comedian.

215
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,314
Well, I really wouldn't know about that.
I don't watch much TV.

216
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,283
I like to read.

217
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,223
What do you do? A lot of that
did-you-ever-notice stuff?

218
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,916
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,523
It strikes me a lot of guys
are doing that kind.

220
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,530
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,728
Well, you really went bald there,
didn't you?

222
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,802
- Yeah, yeah.
- You used to really have...

223
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:55,777
- ...a thick, full head of hair.
- Yeah, yeah.

224
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,643
Poof.

225
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,480
Yeah, well, I guess I started losing it
when I was about 28...

226
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,781
...right around the time
I made my first million.

227
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,550
Yeah. You know,
it's true what they say.

228
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,854
- The first million is the hardest one.
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,589
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.

230
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,434
Have you designed
any buildings in New York?

231
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,900
Have you seen the new addition
to the Guggenheim?

232
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,733
- You did that?
- Yep, yep.

233
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,034
Really didn't take very long either.

234
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,971
Well, you've really built yourself up
into something.

235
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,216
I had a dream, Jerry.

236
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,045
You know,
one can't help but wonder...

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,383
...what brings you into a crummy
little coffee shop like this.

238
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,991
Well, I like to stay in touch
with the people.

239
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,696
You got a hole in your sneaker there.
What is that, canvas?

240
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,229
Yeah, my driver is waiting...

241
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,299
...so I really should get running.
Good to see you guys again.

242
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,436
George, George,
hang on a second...

243
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,936
...because we haven't
seen you in so long.

244
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,037
I thought we might reminisce.

245
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,972
Duncan and I were just talking
about the day of the big race.

246
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,875
Oh, the big race. Yes, yes.

247
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,581
- You were there?
- Oh, sure, sure. I certainly was.

248
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,345
Yeah, I remember that day.
Well, I'll never forget it...

249
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,786
...because that was the day that
I lost my virginity to Miss Stafford...

250
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,053
- ...the voluptuous homeroom teacher.
- Miss Stafford?

251
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,026
Yes, yes. You know,
I was in detention...

252
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,792
...and she came up behind me
while I was erasing the board.

253
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,562
- George.
- But I digress.

254
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,171
Let me see. I remember you were
standing at one end of the line.

255
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,400
I was right next to you...

256
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,205
...and I remember we were even
for the first five yards...

257
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,075
...and then... You were gone.

258
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,808
- Did I get a head start?
- Head start? Oh, no.

259
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,508
Absolutely not. No.

260
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,652
You satisfied? So you see?

261
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,655
No. I'm still not convinced,
and I never will be.

262
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,155
Why don't the two of you
just race again?

263
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,852
- That's a good idea.
- No, no, no.

264
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,657
Another race. Out of the question.

265
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,858
You've been saying that for 20 years.
You know you can't beat me.

266
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,937
You couldn't beat me then,
and you can't beat me now.

267
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,140
Race him, Jerry. Race him.

268
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,640
All right.

269
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,408
I'll do it.

270
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,140
The race is on.

271
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,445
- You're gonna race him?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,079
And he's calling all these people
from high school to come and watch.

273
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,920
I knew this day would come.

274
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,562
I can't. I can't go through with it. I'm
calling it off. I can't let the legend die.

275
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,893
It's like a kid finding out
there's no Santa Claus.

276
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,533
Each according to his ability,
to each according to his means.

277
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,107
What does that mean?

278
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,734
Well, if you got means and ability,
that's a pretty good combination.

279
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,006
So what if I wanna
open a delicatessen?

280
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,173
There are no delicatessens
under Communists.

281
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,818
Whoa, why not?

282
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,749
Well, because the meats
are divided into a class system.

283
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,913
You've got pastrami
and corned beef in one...

284
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,389
...and salami and bologna in another.
Not right.

285
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,221
So you can't get corned beef?

286
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,832
Well, you know,
if you're in the politburo, maybe.

287
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,335
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
Any messages for me?

288
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,972
Why does Mr. Steinbrenner
wanna see me in his office?

289
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,670
Communist? I'm not a Communist.

290
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,946
All right. All right. I'll be there.

291
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,741
My secretary told Mr. Steinbrenner
I'm a Communist.

292
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,147
Now he wants to see me.

293
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,788
You'll just explain to him
that you're not a Communist.

294
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,288
You just called the woman
for a date.

295
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,117
Hello.

296
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,355
Oh, hi, Duncan.
No. Four o'clock tomorrow...

297
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,160
...that is not going to work.

298
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,133
Why? I'll tell you why.

299
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,172
Because I choose not to run.

300
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,434
I'm sorry, Elaine.
This shirt's too fancy.

301
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,206
Just because you're a Communist,
you can't wear anything nice?

302
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,009
- You look like Trotsky.
- Good.

303
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,849
Fine. You wanna be a Communist?
Be a Communist.

304
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,353
Can't you at least look like
a successful Communist?

305
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,719
All right. I'll try it on.

306
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,192
- I'm gonna order Chinese food.
- You're ordering from Hop Sing's?

307
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,831
Does it have to be Hop Sing's?
I kind of had a fight with them.

308
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,098
Elaine, when my father
was blacklisted...

309
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,862
...he couldn't work for years.

310
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,666
He and his friends used to sit
in Hop Sing's every day...

311
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,502
...figuring out how to survive.

312
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,970
- Your father was blacklisted?
- Yes, he was. And you know why?

313
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,579
Because he was betrayed
by people he trusted.

314
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,378
- They named names.
- Okay. Okay.

315
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,051
Yeah, hi. I'd like a delivery, please...

316
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,823
...to 16 West 75th Street.
Apartment 2G.

317
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,556
I know that address.

318
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,497
You're Benes, right?

319
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,966
You're on our list.

320
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,900
No more deliveries!

321
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,703
No, no.
She doesn't live here anymore.

322
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,343
This is someone else.

323
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,274
Oh, yeah? What's the name?

324
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,205
Why do you need a name?
You already have the address.

325
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,578
We need a name.

326
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,151
Give us a name.

327
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
Okay, okay.

328
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,647
Ned Isaacoff.

329
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,352
I want a racing car set.

330
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,694
A racing car set?

331
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,300
Listen. You don't want that.

332
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,097
Those are assembled in Taiwan
by kids like you.

333
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,703
And these Coleman pigs,
they sell it for triple the cost.

334
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,502
- But I want a racing car set.
- No. Don't you see, kid?

335
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,373
You're being bamboozled.

336
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,741
These capitalist fat cats...

337
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,784
...are inflating the profit margin and
reducing your total number of toys.

338
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,013
- Hey, this guy is a commie!
- Hey, kid, quiet.

339
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,891
Where did a nice little boy like you
learn such a bad word like that?

340
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,924
Commie, commie,
traitor to our country.

341
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,533
Santa is not a commie.

342
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,535
He just forgot how his good friend
stuck his neck out for him...

343
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,004
...to get him a good job like this,
didn't he, Santa?

344
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,701
Is there a problem here?

345
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,972
This guy's a commie,
and he's spreading propaganda.

346
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,445
Oh, yeah?

347
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,744
Well, that's enough, pinko.
You're through. The both of you.

348
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,083
- I got two kids in college.
- Oh, you can't fire me. I'm Santa.

349
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,123
Not anymore.
Get your skinny ass out of here!

350
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,689
Hi, how are you?

351
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,789
Fine.

352
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,796
What's the matter?

353
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,764
I just spoke to Duncan.

354
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,100
He said if you don't race,
he's going to fire me.

355
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,199
What? He can't do that.

356
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,269
Yes, he can.

357
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,743
He controls
the means of production.

358
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,106
What are you gonna do, Jerry?

359
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,145
Don't worry, Lois.

360
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,048
I'll think of something.

361
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,323
I knew it was you.
You tried to trick Hop Sing.

362
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,794
You're on our list. Elaine Benes.

363
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,293
And now you're on our list.
Ned Isaacoff.

364
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,601
You got me blacklisted
at Hop Sing's?

365
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,169
She named name.

366
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,145
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steinbrenner?

367
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,345
Yes, George, I did.
Come in, come in.

368
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,391
George, the word around the office
is that you're a Communist.

369
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,253
A Communist?

370
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,865
I am a Yankee, sir,
first and foremost.

371
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,867
A Communist pipeline into the vast
reservoir of Cuban baseball talent...

372
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,006
...could be the greatest thing ever
to happen to this organization.

373
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,698
- Sir?
- You could be invaluable...

374
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,641
...to this franchise. There's a southpaw
nobody's been able to get a look at.

375
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,042
Something-Rodriguez.
I don't really know his name.

376
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,739
Get yourself to Havana right away.

377
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,210
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

378
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,684
- Do my best.
- Good. Merry Christmas, George.

379
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,914
Bring me back some cigars
in the cedar boxes.

380
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,217
The ones with the fancy rings.
Love those rings.

381
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,860
They distract you
while you're smoking.

382
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,826
The red and yellow are nice. Looks
good against the brown of the cigar.

383
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,091
I like the maduro wrapper. The darker,
the better. That's what I say.

384
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,462
The claro's good too.
That's more of a pale brown.

385
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,001
Almost like a milky coffee.

386
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,866
I find the ring size very confusing.

387
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,474
They have it in centimeters,
which I don't understand.

388
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,074
- That was great. Nice job, Santa.
- Yeah.

389
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,237
I knew that stuff was
gonna get us in trouble.

390
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,975
Well, I didn't realize it was
such a sensitive issue.

391
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,416
Communism. You didn't realize
Communism was a sensitive issue?

392
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,648
What do you think's been going on
in the world for the past 50 years?

393
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,884
- Wake up and smell the coffee.
- I guess I screwed up!

394
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,030
Oh, you sure did. Big time.

395
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,272
How do you feel?

396
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,342
I need a miracle.

397
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,780
Now you're gonna see what kind
of a liar you're mixed up with.

398
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,178
Well, if he beats you,
I want a big raise.

399
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,286
If he beats me,
I'll not only give you a raise...

400
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,116
...I'll send you to Hawaii
for two weeks.

401
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,659
I parked in front. As soon as this race
is over, we gotta go to the airport.

402
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,318
Yeah. I'll be there.

403
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,058
You ready, boys?

404
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,927
- Yeah, Mr. Bevilaqua.
- This is the way it's gonna work.

405
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,470
You take your marks. I say,
"Ready, on your mark, get set"...

406
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,266
...and then fire. You got it?

407
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,465
- Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.
- Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.

408
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,373
- Come on, Jerry.
- Come on, Jerry.

409
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,609
Ready.

410
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,275
On your mark.

411
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,692
<i>Jerry.</i>

412
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,717
So will you come to Hawaii
with me, Jerry?

413
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,220
Maybe I will, Lois.

414
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,757
Maybe I will.

415
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,405
<i>You wanted to see me,
el presidente?</i>

416
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:03,676
Come here. I understand you are
very interested in one of our players.

417
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,684
Ordinarily, I would not
grant such a request.

418
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:14,121
<i>But I have heard you are,
how you say, communista simpatico.</i>

419
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,294
Well, good.
Then you can have your pick.

420
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,490
They will play for your Yankees.

421
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,833
And I would be honored
if you would be my guest...

422
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,407
...for dinner tonight
at the Presidential Palace.

423
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,409
There will be girls there.
And I hear some pretty good food.

424
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,410
Of course,
the problem with parties is...

425
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,550
...you invariably have to eat
standing up, which I don't care for.

426
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,915
But on the other hand, I don't like
to balance a plate on my lap either.

427
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,114
Once when I was at a party,
I put my plate on someone's piano.

428
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,088
If I had not been a dictator...

429
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,990
...I would not have been able to
get away with that one.
