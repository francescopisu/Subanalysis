1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,465
Yeah, yeah. All right.

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,570
- Chinese food.
- There's my Chinese food.

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,441
I gotta run.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,603
All you.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,909
- Who was it?
- I did a show for a car dealership.

6
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,609
- They're getting me a new Saab.
- What about your old car?

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,620
- Couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
- No. The engine clotted.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,224
You know who set
this whole thing up? Frank Merman.

9
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,860
Fragile Frankie Merman?

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,957
- Never liked that guy.
- Why? He's harmless.

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,361
Every summer, you guys
went to camp together.

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,024
I was jealous.
It felt he was the summer me.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,863
- He was not the summer you.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,938
Besides, you had a summer me.

15
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,405
<i>Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you
into Last Tango in Paris.</i>

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,702
I made him up.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,144
<i>So you never saw
Last Tango in Paris?</i>

18
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,545
- No.
- Too bad, it was erotic.

19
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,714
Well, I've had it
with these jack-booted thugs.

20
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,091
Pottery Barn?

21
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,560
I got three Pottery Barn catalogs
in one day.

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,131
That makes eight this month.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,563
Mira Sorvino.
Think she'd go out with me?

24
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,401
Why don't you just throw them out?

25
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,974
No. I've been saving them up
here in your apartment.

26
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,168
And now, it's payback time.

27
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,246
Pottery Barn is in for a world of hurt.

28
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,681
Can I have one?

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,483
I need one of those
old-looking phones.

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,181
So you wanna grab a bite?

31
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,620
I can't. I gotta make
the weekly call to the folks.

32
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,657
- So call now.
- Gotta prep.

33
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,490
I need a couple of anecdotes,
a few you-were-right-abouts.

34
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,756
It's a whole procedure.

35
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,963
Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one
that used to run to the woods...

36
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,932
- ...every time he got upset?
- That's him.

37
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,995
- He still nuts?
- What do you think?

38
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,969
They gave me a new car
for 30 minutes of:

39
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,041
"So who's from out of town?"

40
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,379
Seriously, is this the best okra
you've ever had or what?

41
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,817
- Delish.
- Delish?

42
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,051
Delish. You know,
short for delicious.

43
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,657
Oh, like scrump.

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,321
Yeah.

45
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you later.

46
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,826
Excuse me.
Can I borrow your ketchup?

47
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,196
Oh, sure.

48
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,339
Thanks.

49
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,572
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Georgie.

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,480
<i>- Let me put your father on the phone.
- Ma.</i>

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,710
Who's this?

52
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,052
Dad, it's me.

53
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,387
Listen, I was at Fortunoff's
the other day and you know what...

54
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,153
...you were right.

55
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,431
Chinese food.

56
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,395
Sorry, George, our Chinese food
just came. Talk to you later.

57
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,560
Chinese food?

58
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:01,944
Hey, you like sending out catalogs?
How do you like getting them back?

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,591
So maybe they had Chinese food.

60
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,820
After dark?

61
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,227
Please. At their age
that's like swallowing stun grenades.

62
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,165
Well, there's one way to check.
Where there's Chinese food...

63
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,964
...there's leftovers.

64
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,566
Well, gentlemen...

65
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,980
...Laney is in love.

66
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,639
Dynamite. I'll look
for the Chinese food leftovers.

67
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:42,277
Hey, hey, hey. I met this guy.
And it was like this...

68
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,155
...totally unreal fairy tale moment.

69
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,953
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?

70
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,121
Oh, George's friend?
Whatever happened to him?

71
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,628
Nothing. I don't know. I gotta go.

72
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,095
So this is beautiful.

73
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,400
You and Puddy and this new guy
in a big pot of love stew.

74
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,100
Yeah. Puddy.

75
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:10,272
Well, I won't fire him
until I see if this new guy...

76
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,010
...can handle the workload.

77
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,385
Will you look at this?
More catalogs.

78
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,526
<i>Omaha Steaks, MacWarehouse.
Newsweek?</i>

79
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,785
I can't stop all these companies...

80
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,829
...so I'm gonna attack this problem
at the choke point.

81
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,125
Stop the mail?

82
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,128
That's even better.

83
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,804
- Jerry.
- Hey, Frankie.

84
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,033
So where's the car?

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,269
This is it.

86
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,508
- Inside the van?
- It is the van.

87
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,375
Don't you remember, we always
talked about how cool it would be...

88
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,383
...to have a van and just drive.

89
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,218
We were 10.

90
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,717
Come on. Let's take it for a spin.

91
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,318
I don't want a van.

92
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,156
Just tell him you want the Saab.

93
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,696
You don't understand.
This is Fragile Frankie Merman.

94
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,697
When we were in camp,
if you upset him...

95
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,359
...he'd run into the woods,
dig a hole, and sit in it.

96
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,637
Well, I have an idea.

97
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,969
Keep the van and just get
a bumper sticker that says:

98
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,136
"If this van's a-rocking,
don't come a-knocking."

99
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,009
Always helpful.

100
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,714
Oh, Georgie.
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,720
Just dropped in for a visit. You...

102
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,323
You never called me back.

103
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,550
Oh, the phone broke.

104
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,222
Well, we gotta get moving.

105
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,423
- What? Where are you going?
- We have a catered affair.

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,694
- You're going like that?
- It's creative black tie.

107
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,264
Move, woman.

108
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,438
No Chinese leftovers.

109
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,105
George is getting suspicious.

110
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,917
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.

111
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,054
I'm gonna be in the can.

112
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,054
Okay, Jack.

113
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,398
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

114
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,334
Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through.

115
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,134
Yeah. That's right. Again.

116
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,637
Thanks.

117
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,506
- Nice captain's chairs, huh?
- Aye, aye.

118
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,977
Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.

119
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,790
Hold on. There must be a truck
backing up.

120
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,620
- No, that's us.
- Great.

121
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,558
You know, Frankie, I was wondering.

122
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,667
What if I decided that it's silly
to have a van because, you know...

123
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,769
...I live in New York City.

124
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,940
Is there maybe some way
I could exchange it?

125
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,602
- You don't like the van?
- No, no, no. It's just hypothetically.

126
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,180
- I gotta go to the park.
- No. No, you don't.

127
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,610
No woods.

128
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,583
I love the van. I'm a van guy.

129
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,411
Check it out.

130
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,648
Rain and sleet may not stop them.

131
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,090
But let's see them
get by these bricks.

132
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,993
Where'd you get the bricks?

133
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,099
Jerry, the whole building is brick.

134
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,968
You wanna take a ride
with me out to Jersey?

135
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,001
I'm gonna try and sell
the van to a lot.

136
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,636
A dealer? Are you insane?
No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.

137
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,174
I don't think I wanna meet the people
that are in the market for a used van.

138
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,010
- Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
- Okay.

139
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,913
All right. Okay.

140
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,712
Here we go. Yeah.

141
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,151
So for sale, huh?

142
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,722
For sale.

143
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,793
A big juicy van.

144
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:50,394
And oh, we gotta put down,
"interesting trades considered."

145
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,169
- I don't wanna trade.
- No, no, no. You don't have to.

146
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,330
It's all about tickling
their buying bone.

147
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,873
You know what? This is all your mail.
They're putting it in my box now.

148
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,605
Let me see that.

149
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,548
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far.

150
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,210
They keep pushing me
and pushing me.

151
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,654
Now I got no choice
but to go down there and talk to them.

152
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,889
Hey, Jerry.

153
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,894
I'd like you to meet someone.

154
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,862
This is Jack.

155
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,667
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.

156
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,902
Certainly. How long would
you like us to hold it?

157
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,845
Oh, no, no, no. I don't think
you get me. I want out. Permanently.

158
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,613
I'll handle this, Violet.

159
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,412
Why don't you take
your three-hour break?

160
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,455
All right, calm down, everyone.
No one's canceling any mail.

161
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,185
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Well, what about your bills?

162
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,386
- The bank can pay them.
- The bank.

163
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,292
Then what about your cards
and letters?

164
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:57,198
E-mail, telephones, fax machines,
FedEx, Telex, telegrams.

165
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,429
- Holograms.
- All right. It's true.

166
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,630
Of course nobody needs mail.

167
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,401
What, you think you're so clever,
figuring that one out?

168
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,307
But you don't know the half
of what goes on here.

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,247
So just walk away, Kramer.
I beg of you.

170
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,483
Is everything all right here,
postal employee Newman?

171
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,648
Yes, sir. I believe
everything is all squared away.

172
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,656
Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?

173
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,796
Oh, yeah.
As long as I stop getting mail.

174
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,867
Welcome back.

175
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,273
Pretty quick, for a catered affair.

176
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,767
I don't know what you mean.

177
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,708
You ditched me. That's twice.

178
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Now I demand to know
what's going on.

179
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,612
George, we've had it with you.

180
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:52,315
Understand, we love you like a son,
but even parents have limits.

181
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:57,428
The breakups, the firings,
and every Sunday with the calls.

182
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:02,131
What my wife is trying to say is,
this is supposed to be our time.

183
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,030
- I'm not following.
- I'm sorry, George.

184
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,536
- We're cutting you loose.
- You're cutting me loose?

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,334
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna make love to your mother.

186
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,851
They don't want to see me anymore.

187
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,180
But this is what
you've always wanted.

188
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,323
It is.

189
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,188
Just not ready yet.

190
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,089
- That's kind of sweet.
- Shut up, Jerry.

191
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,991
My parents think
they can ignore me.

192
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,567
Well, they better think again.

193
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,568
Oh, no, George. Please.
What are you gonna do?

194
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,206
You remember my cousin, Rhisa?

195
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,031
- I'm gonna date her.
- Mother of God.

196
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,374
One little wink. She'll freak out,
tell my parents. They'll be all over me.

197
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,708
What is this tape?

198
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,374
That guy Elaine's dating
seems really familiar to me.

199
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,885
I think he might be a comedian
I worked with one time.

200
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,589
Wait a second. What-?
What, what is this?

201
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,659
<i>This weekend
Nobody Beats The Wiz...</i>

202
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,489
<i>...is slashing prices
on our entire stock.</i>

203
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,565
<i>Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.</i>

204
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,861
<i>Yes. I'm the Wiz. I'm the Wiz.</i>

205
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,070
That is the guy.

206
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,936
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?

207
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,736
She thinks she's in love with him.

208
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,879
She's just remembering
this old commercial.

209
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,074
- That's pretty pathetic.
- I know. They're not even related.

210
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,145
Hey.

211
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,980
Hey.

212
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,680
- I'm gonna get going.
- Have fun at the family reunion.

213
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,419
So, what do you know
about this Jack fella?

214
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,964
- Isn't he the best?
- Yeah, nobody beats him.

215
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,465
Yeah.

216
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,636
What kind of work does he do?

217
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,138
<i>Oh, right now he's a fact-checker
for New York Magazine.</i>

218
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,146
It's not much, but it has a certain kind
of quiet dignity.

219
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,211
Right. Quiet dignity.

220
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,614
As opposed to, say...

221
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,878
...this.

222
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,148
<i>Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.</i>

223
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,452
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

224
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,055
Hello?

225
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,496
Yeah, the van is still for sale.
Sure, come on by.

226
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,396
Yeah, I called about the van.

227
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,307
- Some more merlot?
- Yeah, thanks.

228
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,909
Sure.

229
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,004
You know, Rhisa, I-

230
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,083
I've always found you
very attractive.

231
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,645
What?

232
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,456
I know it may sound shocking...

233
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:45,495
...but I just can't stop myself
from wanting you.

234
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,689
You wanna borrow money, right?

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,834
No, no. I-I just want us to be...

236
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,163
...together.

237
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,931
All right.

238
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,807
- All right?
- Let's go for it.

239
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,436
Well, we could dance around it
a little first.

240
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,913
No. Let's be bad, George.

241
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,644
- Let's be really bad.
- Whoa, easy.

242
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,991
- So how come you're selling it?
- You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.

243
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,187
- How many miles?
- Two.

244
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,957
City or highway?

245
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,362
Look, do you really wanna buy
this thing or what?

246
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,026
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
I'm not gonna be pressured.

247
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,535
I'll walk away right now.

248
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,737
Is this thing bent?

249
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,740
- I'm not paying for that.
- All right, just get out of here.

250
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,941
All right. Look, I'm gonna be honest.

251
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,382
I'm very interested in the van.

252
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,048
Okay, fine. What do I have to do
to put you in this van today?

253
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,217
Well, I don't really have any money,
but it says right here:

254
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,090
Interesting trades considered?

255
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,289
- You put that in.
- Glad, I did.

256
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,058
Here.

257
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,098
You wanna trade me an undershirt?

258
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,366
No, I want to trade you screen legend
Anthony Quinn's undershirt.

259
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,238
He took this off to do sit-ups
in the park and I nabbed it.

260
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,840
- That's disgusting.
- Well, that's my final offer.

261
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,086
You dumped me for some idiotic
TV pitchman?

262
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,619
I'm sorry, Puddy. It was a mistake.

263
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,692
Let's just, let's just put it
behind us...

264
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,092
...and we can continue
as if this never happened.

265
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,459
Jeez, I don't know.
What if we're out somewhere...

266
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,931
...and you see
the Maytag Repairman?

267
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,236
- You're not taking me back?
- That's right.

268
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,407
He's not idiotic.

269
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,011
He's the Wiz.
And nobody beats him.

270
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,910
Nobody.

271
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,512
Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on.

272
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,117
Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.

273
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,783
Why does this dummy have a bucket
on his head?

274
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,119
Because we're blind to their tyranny.

275
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,989
Shouldn't you
be wearing the bucket?

276
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,053
Yeah. Move along, Betty.

277
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,064
Is this Jerry Seinfeld's van?

278
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,769
Not anymore. He traded it to me
for some Hollywood memorabilia.

279
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,735
- I'm so stupid.
- What?

280
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,140
I'm so stupid. Excuse- I'm sorry.

281
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,947
Hey, nice to meet you.

282
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,644
She's into it?

283
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,582
She's leaving me dirty messages
on my answering machine.

284
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,916
So have your parents
found out about it?

285
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,185
She wants to keep it quiet. She thinks
we have a real future together.

286
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,988
It's a brave new world, all right.

287
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,593
Hey, guys.

288
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,829
Hey, how's the anti-mail
campaign going?

289
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,460
Oh, boy, it's fantastic. We were out
in front of the post office today...

290
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,334
...and not one person went in.

291
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,975
It's Sunday.

292
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,675
Why is the mailman
wearing a bucket?

293
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,448
Well, it symbolizes our persecution.

294
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,312
Shouldn't you be
wearing the bucket?

295
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,852
Hey, I want my van keys back.

296
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,890
Well, I thought we made a deal
for Quinn's T-shirt?

297
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,357
Are you insane?

298
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,362
- Give them.
- No, I can't. I can't.

299
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,191
See, I told Frank he could borrow it.

300
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,027
Yeah, he wants to move some
of George's stuff into storage.

301
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,134
Wait a minute.

302
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,703
He's picking up the van tonight?
This is perfect.

303
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,806
I'll drive Rhisa
to some place romantic...

304
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,966
...then when my father slides
the door open...

305
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,374
...I'm in the van
kissing his brother's daughter.

306
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,776
Jerry, one of your friends came by...

307
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,076
...and he was very upset
that I had your wheels.

308
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,411
Oh, no, not Frankie.

309
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,384
I didn't catch his name,
but he went running into the park.

310
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,050
Oh, no, the woods, the hole.

311
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,864
- Hey.
- Kramer, what the hell are you doing?

312
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,866
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket
to something else.

313
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,266
- Not that.
- What?

314
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,598
You're in trouble, Kramer.

315
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,367
I shouldn't be talking to you.
I'm telling you as a friend.

316
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,839
Here's how it's gonna happen.

317
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,174
You may be walking, maybe on
a crisp autumn day just like today...

318
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,111
...when a mail truck will slow
beside you, the door will open.

319
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,582
A mailman you know, maybe even
trust, will offer to give you a lift.

320
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,187
- Are you through?
- No.

321
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,050
And no one will ever see you again.

322
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,317
- Are you through?
- Yes.

323
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,017
No, wait.

324
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,525
Okay, yes.

325
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,433
- Quick. Get in.
- Oh, no, no, no.

326
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,902
That's exactly how you said
it was going down.

327
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,802
There's another way.
It's going down now!

328
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,706
No, you said a mailman I know,
and you're a mailman I know.

329
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,677
I know you know,
but you don't know what I know.

330
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,111
Frankie?

331
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,582
Frankie?

332
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,887
Frankie?

333
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,386
Frankie, is that you?

334
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,786
My name is Edgar.

335
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,294
Have a nice night.

336
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,226
Thank you.

337
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,861
Stupid.

338
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,628
So stupid.

339
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,099
Jerry?

340
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,639
All right, George.

341
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,180
I'm ready.

342
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,113
Yeah, hold on. I'm -

343
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,413
I'm just trying to get a reading
on my dashboard compass.

344
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,751
Where are my parents?

345
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,586
Georgie.

346
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,958
Is this Seinfeld's van?
Seinfeld's van. Seinfeld's van.

347
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,292
- Wait. What's he saying?
- I think he's saying Son of Sam.

348
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,299
- Oh, my God!
- I thought they caught him.

349
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,529
I knew it wasn't Berkowitz.

350
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,202
So I told him, hit the road,
I'm going back with Jack.

351
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,010
That's the second good piece
of news I've gotten.

352
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,674
Really? What was the first?

353
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,622
They're bringing me back.

354
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,122
Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.

355
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,884
What?

356
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,688
I'm the Wiz. I'm the Wiz.

357
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,299
What-? What about
your fact-checking job?

358
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,028
Oh, here's a fact. I'm the Wiz.

359
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,909
I'm the Wiz and nobody beats me.

360
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,737
Frankie. Come on out of there.

361
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,310
- You hate the van.
- But I'm keeping it.

362
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,217
As much as I hate the idea
of being a van guy...

363
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,153
...it's a lot better than hanging out here
with the nocturnal dirt people.

364
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,320
So can we go for a ride?

365
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,587
Yeah, let's just
get the hell out of here.

366
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,758
Are you done with that?

367
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,408
Good. He left the door unlocked.

368
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,035
Why did Kramer have to
park the van in the woods?

369
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,116
Isn't it obvious? There are
no parking meters out here.

370
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,012
Hey, look at this.

371
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,921
Hoochie mama.

372
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,761
Oh, my goodness,
what have they done to you here?

373
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,333
Who are you?

374
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,972
Well-

375
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,534
You can just call me Henry.

376
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,906
Henry Atkins,
the postmaster general?

377
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,444
Last time I checked.

378
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,809
Henry, can I get out of here now?

379
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,451
Oh, oh, sit a bit.

380
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,711
Sit a bit.

381
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,085
I mean, after all, I drove all the way
up here from D.C. just to talk to you.

382
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,252
I even had to cancel a round of golf
with the secretary of state.

383
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,488
Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?

384
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,831
Yeah.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,993
Mr. Kramer, I've been reading some
of your material here.

386
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,729
I gotta be honest with you.

387
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,500
You make a pretty strong case.

388
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,165
I mean, just imagine.

389
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,939
An army of men in wool pants,
running through the neighborhood...

390
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,448
...handing out pottery catalogs
door to door.

391
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,982
Well, it's my job...

392
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,951
...and I'm pretty damn serious about it.

393
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,553
In addition to being a postmaster...

394
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,492
...I'm a general and we both know...

395
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,967
...it's the job of a general to,
by God, get things done.

396
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,334
So maybe you can understand...

397
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,006
...why I get a little irritated when
somebody calls me away from my golf.

398
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,545
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

399
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,615
Sure, you're sorry.

400
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,878
I think we got a stack of mail there
at the desk that belongs to you.

401
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,045
Now you want that mail,
don't you, Mr. Kramer?

402
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,690
Sure do.

403
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,053
- Now that's better.
- All right.

404
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,224
Newman?

405
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,035
Tell the world my story.

406
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,209
- Hey, George.
- Jerry.

407
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,781
- Hey, that's the guy.
- What?

408
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,645
George Costanza. Frankie Merman.

409
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,412
The summer me.

410
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,613
The winter me.

411
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,386
You must be George's cousin.

412
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,919
Girlfriend.

413
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,854
All right.

414
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,656
Hey, what is that?

415
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,166
That van's a-rocking.

416
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,669
Then don't go a-knocking.

417
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,602
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

418
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,845
Oh, you gotta sell this van.

419
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,742
Oh, yeah.

420
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,821
What you saw in the van
was a natural expression...

421
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,584
...of a man's love for his lady.

422
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,126
Your father's right. It's beautiful.

423
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,631
And it was safe.

424
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,235
Oh, God.

425
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,873
Now if you'll excuse me,
once again...

426
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,807
- ...your mother and I-
- Oh, make it stop.
