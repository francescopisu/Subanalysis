1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,529
So Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,573
Sure, without the parents,
it's a breeze.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:13,042
- Hey, Happy Hanukkah.
- Hey, Tim. Great party.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,010
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,883
Hey, George, thanks again
for getting me those Yankee tickets.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,043
Oh, you're still in good
with the ground crew.

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,280
That's good.
Look, I'd better circulate.

8
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,390
Happy Hanukkah, Tiffany.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,959
This place is like Studio 54
with a menorah.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,427
I'm gonna get more of these
kosher cocktail franks.

11
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,795
Oh, I got Denim Vest
checking me out.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,133
Fake phone number's
coming out tonight.

13
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,863
Oh, you have a standard fake?

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,374
Spell's out "No Elaine."

15
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,971
- Isn't that eight letters?
- The extra E is for...

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,710
That's neat.

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,578
No, please. Denim Vest.

18
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,780
He's smoothing it. Jerry. God.

19
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,481
Hi.

20
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,756
- Hi, I'm Jerry.
- Hi.

21
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:05,728
You might not know it to look at me,
but I can run really, really fast.

22
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,262
Nice vest.
I like the big metal buttons.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,739
They're snaps. Listen, maybe
we should go out sometime?

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,708
Why don't I give you
my phone number?

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,947
How did it go with that girl?

26
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,109
Great, I'm going out with her
tomorrow night.

27
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,256
- How did it go with the franks?
- Great. Ate the entire platter.

28
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,290
- Had to call in sick today.
- Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,394
Hey, I work for
Kruger Industrial Smoothing.

30
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,656
- We don't care and it shows.
- You gotta open your mail here?

31
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,266
Hey, at least I'm bringing
something to this.

32
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,426
"Have you seen me?" Nope.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,094
There's something from Whatley.

34
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,436
See? You give and you get.
This is what I'm trying to teach you.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,875
This holiday season a donation
has been made in your name...

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,481
- ...to the Children's Alliance?
- Oh, that's nice.

37
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,050
I got him Yankee tickets. He's saying,
"I gave your gift to someone else."

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,053
- To a children's charity.
- Don't you see how wrong that is?

39
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,283
Where's your Christmas spirit?
An eye for an eye.

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,451
Do me a favor, don't give me
anything this year.

41
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,824
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,226
Oh, nothing for me.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,460
- I'm going to Atomic Sub later.
- Why are you eating there?

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,504
I got a card and they stamp it
every time I buy a sub.

45
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,165
Twenty-four stamps
and I become a submarine captain.

46
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,039
What does that mean?

47
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,839
Free sub.

48
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,853
- What?
- Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,580
- What is it?
- Elaine.

50
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,924
Dear son, Happy Festivus.

51
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,153
- What is Festivus?
- It's nothing. Stop it.

52
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,762
- When George was growing-
- No.

53
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,423
His father hated all the commercial
religious aspects of Christmas.

54
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,125
- Yeah?
- He made up his own holiday.

55
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,761
Oh, and another piece of the puzzle
falls into place.

56
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,738
- All right.
- And instead of a tree...

57
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,901
...didn't your father
put up an aluminum pole?

58
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,205
- Stop it.
- Weren't there feats of strength...

59
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,848
...that ended up with you crying?

60
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,611
I can't take it anymore.
I'm going to work. You happy now?

61
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,347
Hey, neighbor.

62
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,718
Are you reading my VCR manual?

63
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,521
Well, we can't all be reading the
classics, Professor High Brow.

64
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,962
Oh, I can't believe it.
I've lost my Atomic Sub card.

65
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,036
Oh, no. I bet I wrote
that fake number on the back of it...

66
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,469
- ...when I gave it to Denim Vest.
- So?

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,507
I've eaten 23 bad subs.
I just need one more.

68
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,646
It's like a long bad movie,
but you wanna see the end of it.

69
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,212
- No, you walk out.
- All right.

70
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,145
Then it's like a boring book.
You gotta finish it.

71
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,286
No, you wait for the movie.

72
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,321
I want that free sub.

73
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,424
You don't need the card.

74
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,619
High-end hoagie outfit like that.
It's all computerized.

75
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,458
Technology.
They're cloning sheep now.

76
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,999
No, no, no. They're not cloning sheep.
It's the same sheep.

77
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,696
I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick
with two goats and a handkerchief...

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,170
<i>...on the old Dean Martin Show.</i>

79
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,340
Now I gotta get a hold
of Denim Vest.

80
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,605
Why don't you try your blow off
number, see if he's called it?

81
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,681
That's a good idea.

82
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,316
Yeah, go.

83
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,117
What?

84
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,921
Really?

85
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,925
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Bye.

86
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,692
Great news. Yeah, the strike's
been settled. I'm going back to work.

87
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,596
- What strike?
- H & H Bagels.

88
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,827
That's where I worked.

89
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,198
- You?
- Worked?

90
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,771
- Bagels?
- Yeah, look, see?

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,464
I still have my business card.

92
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,110
Yeah, we've been on strike
for 12 years.

93
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,769
Hey, I remember seeing
those guys picketing out there.

94
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,710
But I haven't seen them in a long time.

95
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,873
H & H wouldn't let us
use their bathroom...

96
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,348
...while we were picketing.

97
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,511
They were cramping our solidarity.

98
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,717
What were your demands?

99
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,986
Yeah, five thirty-five an hour,
and that's what they're paying now.

100
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,528
I believe that's the new
minimum wage.

101
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,632
And now you know
who to thank for that.

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,793
- All right, I gotta go.
- Why didn't you ever mention this?

103
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,496
Well, Jerry, I didn't want you to know
I was out of work.

104
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,198
It's embarrassing.

105
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,106
All right, everybody, I'm back.

106
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,342
- Who are you?
- Cosmo Kramer. Strike's over.

107
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,751
Oh, yeah, Kramer.

108
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,652
Didn't any of the other guys
come back?

109
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,488
No. I'm sure they all got other jobs
like 10 years ago.

110
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,823
What? Man.

111
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,865
Well, it kind of makes you wonder
what it was all for.

112
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,934
I could use someone for the holidays.

113
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,266
All right. Toss me an apron.
Let's bagel.

114
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,043
- What are those?
- Those are raisin bagels.

115
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,514
I never thought I'd live to see that.

116
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,783
So anyway, I've been giving out your
phone number as my standard fake.

117
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,582
So you're Elaine Benes.

118
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,521
We've been getting calls
for you for five years.

119
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,593
So listen, when this guy calls, if you
could just give him my real number.

120
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,562
Hey, Charlie, guess who's here?
Elaine Benes.

121
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,703
Elaine Benes?

122
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,701
Elaine Benes.

123
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,074
You make a lot of man friends.
You know who's a man?

124
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,873
Charlie here. He's a man.
You know who else? Me.

125
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,142
- I'm a man.
- I'm a man.

126
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,912
Oh, my.

127
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,647
I'll have this Vest guy
call your real number.

128
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,917
You just give it to me...

129
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,754
...and that way I'll have it.

130
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,997
My number?

131
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,156
Okay.

132
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,536
Well, here you go.

133
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:52,772
And tell you what, put a sawbuck on
Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.

134
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,903
Hey, Jerry.

135
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,777
- Hey, Tim.
- What's up?

136
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,248
I'm having dinner with a girl
I met at your party.

137
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,783
Jerry. Hi.

138
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,855
- Gwen?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,656
- Really?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,355
Come on, our table's ready.

141
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,798
So attractive one day,
not attractive the next.

142
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,102
- Have you come across this?
- Yes, I am familiar with the syndrome.

143
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,044
- She's a two-face.
- Like the Batman villain?

144
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,877
If that helps you.

145
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,451
If I ask her out again,
I don't know who's showing up.

146
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,985
The good, the bad, or the ugly.

147
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,952
- Clint Eastwood.
- Yeah.

148
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,284
Hey, check this out.

149
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,620
I gotta give Christmas presents
at Kruger...

150
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,284
...so I'm pulling a Whatley.

151
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,557
A donation has been made
in your name to the Human Fund.

152
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,791
- What is that?
- Made it up.

153
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,565
The Human Fund.
Money for people.

154
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,865
What do you think?

155
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,534
It has a certain
understated stupidity.

156
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,308
<i>The Outlaw Josey Wales.</i>

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,742
Yeah.

158
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,975
- Bagels on the house.
- Hey.

159
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,052
- How was your first day?
- Oh, fantastic.

160
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,156
It felt so good to get my hands
back in that dough.

161
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,525
- Your hands were in the dough?
- No, I didn't make these bagels.

162
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,795
Yeah, they're day-olds.
The homeless won't even touch them.

163
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,561
We try to fool them
by putting a few fresh ones on top...

164
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,500
...but they dig, they test.

165
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,834
- All right. I'm out of here.
- Happy Festivus.

166
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,672
- What's Festivus?
- When George was-

167
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,006
- No.
- His father-

168
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,307
Stop it. It's nothing.

169
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,350
It's a stupid holiday
my father invented. It doesn't exist.

170
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,715
Happy Festivus, Georgie.

171
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,259
Frank invented a holiday?
He's so prolific.

172
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,328
Kramer. Listen,
I got a little phone relay going.

173
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,024
So if a guy calls H & H and he's
looking for me, you take a message.

174
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,192
You're still trying
to get that free sub?

175
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,364
Hey, I have spent a lot of time
and I have eaten a lot of crap...

176
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,911
...to get to where I am today,
and I am not throwing it all away now.

177
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,240
Is there a captain's hat
involved in this?

178
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,239
Maybe.

179
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,716
Kramer, I got your message.

180
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,412
I haven't celebrated Festivus in years.

181
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,388
- What is your interest?
- Well, just tell me everything.

182
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,154
Many Christmases ago,
I went to buy a doll for my son.

183
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:30,200
I reached for the last one they had,
but so did another man.

184
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,835
As I rained blows upon him,
I realized there had to be another way.

185
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,339
- What happened to the doll?
- It was destroyed.

186
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,446
But out of that
a new holiday was born.

187
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,606
A Festivus for the rest of us.

188
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,615
That must have been
some kind of doll.

189
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,350
She was.

190
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,425
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

191
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,621
Oh, Sandy,
here is a little something for you.

192
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,424
Thanks.

193
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,766
Phil, loved those cigars. Incoming.

194
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,806
- Mr. Kruger, sir. Merry Christmas.
- Not if you could see our books.

195
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,208
- What is this?
- The Human Fund.

196
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,274
- Whatever.
- Exactly.

197
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,781
Merry Christmas.

198
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,785
And at the Festivus dinner you gather
your family around and tell them...

199
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,652
...all the ways they have
disappointed you over the past year.

200
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,454
- And is there a tree?
- No. Instead there's a pole.

201
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,191
Requires no decoration.
I find tinsel distracting.

202
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,303
Frank, this new holiday of yours,
it's scratching me right where I itch.

203
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,768
- Let's do it then.
- All right.

204
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,171
Festivus is back. I'll get the pole out
of the crawl space.

205
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,038
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, woman.

206
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,579
Kramer. Kramer.
Any word from the Vest?

207
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,841
No, no.

208
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,315
Listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.

209
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,217
Hey, I hired you to work during
the holidays. This is the holidays.

210
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,324
- But it's Festivus.
- What?

211
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,521
You're infringing on my right
to celebrate new holidays.

212
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,993
- That's not a right.
- Well, it's going to be...

213
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,428
...because I'm going back on strike.

214
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,264
Yeah, it's a walkout.

215
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,993
I gotta stay and wait for the call.

216
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,535
You're siding with management?

217
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,195
- No. I'm just-
- Scab.

218
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,103
Scab. Scab.

219
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,871
- Hey.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.

220
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,675
- You were expecting someone else?
- You never know.

221
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,079
You know, you might want
to take the tunnel.

222
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,346
So, what do you feel like eating?
Chinese or Italian?

223
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,789
I could go either way.

224
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,388
You're telling me.

225
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,568
So she was switching back and forth?

226
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,727
The whole time.

227
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,603
She was like a 3D baseball card
that changes depending on the angle.

228
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,937
So one minute she's pretty
and at the plate...

229
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,546
...and the next she's ugly
and advancing the runners.

230
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,683
- So, what happened next?
- Well, we stopped by here...

231
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,945
...and the only place
she always looked good...

232
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,884
...was in that back booth over there.

233
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,183
Just bring her here.
This is all you really need.

234
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,826
I can't just keep bringing her
to the coffee shop.

235
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,087
I mean, what if things,
you know, progress?

236
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,821
Lights out.

237
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,164
All right, I'll give it a shot.
I do really like this coffee shop.

238
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,104
- Nice cuff links, by the way.
- Office Christmas gift.

239
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,401
I tell you, this Human Fund
is a gold mine.

240
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,511
That's not a French cuff shirt,
you know?

241
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,079
I know, I cut the button off
and poked a hole.

242
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,943
Oh, that's classy.

243
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,249
Well, happy Festivus.

244
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,652
What is that? Is that the pole?

245
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,761
George, Festivus is your heritage.
It's part of who you are.

246
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,487
That's why I hate it.

247
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,100
There's a big dinner Tuesday night
at Frank's house. Everyone's invited.

248
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,731
George...

249
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,999
...you're forgetting how much
Festivus has meant to us all.

250
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,008
I brought one of the cassette tapes.

251
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,147
<i>- Read that poem.
- I can't read it. I need my glasses.</i>

252
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,249
<i>You don't need glasses.
You're just weak. You're weak.</i>

253
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,146
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

254
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:13,992
<i>All right, George. It's time
for the Festivus feats of strength.</i>

255
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,928
Oh, no. Turn it off. There's no
feats of strength. I hate Festivus.

256
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,132
We had some good times.

257
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:27,339
- Hey.
- Hi, there. This is Kramer and Frank.

258
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,873
- Hi.
- Hello.

259
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,171
- So you ready to go?
- Why don't we stay here?

260
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,974
The back booth just opened up.

261
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,482
Now, this is a good-looking booth.

262
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,825
Get Festivus. Hey, no bagel,
no bagel, no bagel, no bagel.

263
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,089
Hey, no bagel, no bagel,
no bagel...

264
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,666
Lady, if you want a sandwich,
I'll make you a sandwich.

265
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,168
I want the one that I earned.

266
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,430
I'll get it. I'll get it.

267
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,270
H & H and Elaine.
Elaine, you should get out of there.

268
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,277
I sabotaged the bagel machine
last night. It's going down.

269
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,972
- What did you do?
- You've been warned.

270
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,543
Oh, hi.

271
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,251
- Hey, the steam valve broke.
- Can we still make bagels?

272
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,018
Sure. It's just a little steamy.

273
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,857
How do you like your bagels now?

274
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,372
George, I got something for you.

275
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,030
I'm supposed to find a charity...

276
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,369
...and throw some
of the company's money at it.

277
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,638
They all seem the same to me,
so, what's the difference?

278
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,307
- Twenty thousand dollars?
- Made out to the Human Fund.

279
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,244
Gee.

280
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,247
Oh, damn, I've locked myself
out of my office again.

281
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,023
All right. I'm going home.

282
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,303
Jerry, how many times
do we have to come to this place?

283
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,938
Why? It's our place.

284
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,404
I just found a rubber band
in my soup.

285
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,634
Well, I know who's cooking today.

286
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,803
- Hey, surprise, surprise.
- Hey, Georgie.

287
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,814
I think I'm just gonna go.

288
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,076
I'll be here.

289
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,652
- Hey, soup.
- She didn't touch it.

290
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,084
Paco.

291
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,963
Hey, take a look at this.

292
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,428
Twenty thousand dollars from Kruger?
You're not keeping this.

293
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,540
- I don't know.
- Excuse me?

294
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,699
I've been thinking,
this might be my chance...

295
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,276
...to start giving back.

296
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,879
You wanna give something back?
Start with the $20,000.

297
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,449
- I'm serious.
- You're gonna start your own charity?

298
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,781
I think I could be a philanthropist.
A kick-ass philanthropist.

299
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,856
I would have all this money
and people would love me.

300
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,117
Then, they would come to me
and beg.

301
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,352
And if I felt like it,
I would help them out...

302
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,360
...and then,
they would owe me big time.

303
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,826
The first thing I'm gonna need
is a driver.

304
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,368
No bagel, no bagel, no bagel,
no bagel, no bagel.

305
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,904
Kramer, Vest just called.

306
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,043
Yamahama, it's fright night.

307
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,805
Oh, yeah. I got a little steam bath.

308
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,417
Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have
my hands on that Atomic Sub card.

309
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,051
And?

310
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,153
Free sub.

311
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,351
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

312
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,985
- Kramer. Hi.
- Oh, hello.

313
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,187
It's Gwen.
We met at the coffee shop.

314
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,564
I'm dating your friend, Jerry.

315
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,930
Oh, I don't know
who you really are...

316
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,164
...but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend
and she's not you.

317
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,000
You're much better looking
and like a foot taller.

318
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,977
That's why we're always hiding
in that coffee shop.

319
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,584
- He's afraid of getting caught.
- Oh, he's a tomcat.

320
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,449
Steve.

321
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,253
- It's Elaine.
- From Tim Whatley's party?

322
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,722
- Yeah.
- You look...

323
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,253
...different.

324
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,727
I see you're still sticking
with the denim.

325
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,126
Do you have that card
that I gave you?

326
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,132
Well, I had it back at my place...

327
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,396
...but I can't go there now.
I'll give it to you later or something.

328
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,540
No, no, no.
You give me your number.

329
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,804
Okay. Sure.

330
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,744
- Do you have the mumps?
- No.

331
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,781
- Typhoid?
- No.

332
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,918
Yamahama.

333
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,789
A fake number. Blimey.

334
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,728
George, we've got a problem.

335
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,732
There's a memo here
from accounting...

336
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,929
...telling me there's no such thing
as the Human Fund.

337
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,899
Well, there could be.

338
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,443
But there isn't.

339
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,615
Well, I could-
I could give the money back. Here.

340
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,581
George, I don't get it.

341
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,917
If there's no Human Fund,
those donation cards were fake.

342
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,850
You better have
a damn good reason...

343
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,359
...why you gave me
a fake Christmas gift.

344
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,694
Well, sir, I gave out
the fake card because...

345
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,767
...I don't really celebrate Christmas.

346
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,674
I celebrate Festivus.

347
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,936
- Vemonus?
- Festivus, sir.

348
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:38,015
And I was afraid that I would be
persecuted for my beliefs.

349
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,777
They drove my family out
of Bayside, sir.

350
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,547
- Are you making all this up too?
- Oh, no, sir.

351
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:49,627
Festivus is all too real
and I could prove it... if I have to.

352
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,695
Yeah, you probably should.

353
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,398
- Happy Festivus.
- George. This is a surprise.

354
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,471
- Who's the suit?
- Yo, Dad, this is my boss Mr. Kruger.

355
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,139
- Have you seen the pole?
- No, he doesn't need to see the pole.

356
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,107
He's gonna see it.

357
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,641
Happy Festivus.

358
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,250
Yamahama.

359
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,852
I didn't have time to go home.
What are you doing here?

360
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,819
- Embracing my roots.
- They nailed you on the 20 G's?

361
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,982
Busted cold.

362
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,324
It's made from aluminum.
Very high strength to weight ratio.

363
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,660
I find your belief system fascinating.

364
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,697
Hey, Happy Festivus, everyone.

365
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,603
- Hello, again, Miss Benes.
- What are you doing here?

366
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,973
Damnedest thing. Me and Charlie
were calling to ask you out...

367
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,205
...and we got this bagel place.

368
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:48,285
I told them I was just about to see you.
It's a Festivus miracle.

369
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,684
- Dinner's ready.
- Let's begin.

370
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,854
Dr. Van Nostrand.

371
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,554
Oh, that's right.

372
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,192
Welcome, newcomers.

373
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:08,736
The tradition of Festivus begins
with the airing of grievances.

374
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,034
I got a lot of problems
with you people...

375
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,940
...and now you're gonna
hear about it.

376
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,875
Yo, Kruger.

377
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,778
My son tells me your company stinks.

378
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,612
Oh, God.

379
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,451
Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute.

380
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,449
Kruger.

381
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,926
You couldn't smooth a silk sheet
if you had a hot date with a babe-

382
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,265
I lost my train of thought.

383
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,528
- Jerry.
- Gwen?

384
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,470
- How did you know I was here?
- Kramer told me.

385
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,837
Another Festivus miracle.

386
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,080
I guess this is the ugly girl
I've been hearing about.

387
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,011
Hey, I was in a shvitz for six hours.
Give me a break.

388
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,858
Gwen. Gwen, wait.

389
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,957
Bad lighting on the porch.

390
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:08,498
- Hey, how did my horse do?
- He had to be shot.

391
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,204
And now as Festivus rolls on,
we come to the feats of strength.

392
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,863
Not the feats of strength.

393
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,771
This year the honor
goes to Mr. Kramer.

394
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,677
Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

395
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,782
I have to work a double shift
at H & H.

396
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,350
- I thought you were on strike.
- Yeah, well, I caved.

397
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,453
I mean, I really had
to use their bathroom.

398
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,647
Frank, no offense,
but this holiday's a little...

399
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,848
...out there.

400
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,357
Hey, Kramer, you can't go.

401
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,290
Who's gonna do
the feats of strength?

402
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,692
How about George?

403
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,794
Good thinking, Cougar.

404
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,132
Until you pin me, George,
Festivus is not over.

405
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,366
Oh, please. Somebody stop this.

406
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,238
Let's rumble.

407
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,506
- I think you can take him, Georgie.
- Hey, come on. Be sensible.

408
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,048
Stop crying and fight your father.

409
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,278
- Oh, I give. I give.
- This is the best Festivus ever.

410
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,848
All right. That's enough. You're fired.

411
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,422
Thank you.
