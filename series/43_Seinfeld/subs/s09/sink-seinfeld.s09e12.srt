1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,705
- Careful. This plate is extremely hot.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,004
I just told you it was hot.
Why did you touch it?

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,013
I just wanted to know
what your idea of hot is.

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,381
Hey, babe,
you ready to hit the ice?

5
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,354
Yep, I am ready to skate up a-

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,428
Why are you wearing that?

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,027
It's my winter coat.

8
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,792
- A fur?
- Is there a problem?

9
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,401
Seemingly infinite supply.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,672
Careful, it's hot.

11
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,116
So Puddy wears a man fur?

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,850
He was strutting around
the coffee shop like Stein Eriksen.

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,393
And of course you find
fur morally reprehensible?

14
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,422
Anti-fur. I mean, who has
the energy anymore?

15
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,730
This is more about hanging off
the arm of an idiot.

16
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,664
This is the first you're seeing
of the coat?

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,807
We never dated in winter.

18
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,171
You might wanna get a look
at that bathing suit drawer.

19
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,545
We walked by Bloomingdales
and I saw that massage chair...

20
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,116
...we wanna get Joe Mayo
as an apartment gift.

21
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,844
An apartment-warming gift?

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,751
We gotta give presents
to people for moving?

23
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,256
Birthdays, Christmas,
it's enough gifts.

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,792
I would like one month off.

25
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,362
Kramer said it's perfect.
That's what we're getting.

26
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,989
We're not buying it at Bloomingdales.
I will buy it. You pay me back later.

27
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,102
I'll sniff out a deal.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,170
I have a sixth sense.

29
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,308
Cheapness is not a sense.

30
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,535
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties.

31
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,612
You know, the second you walk in,
he's got you working for him.

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,476
"Hey, can you do me a favor?

33
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,346
Can you keep an eye on the ice,
make sure we have enough?"

34
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,290
I had a great time at the last one.
I was in charge of the music.

35
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,118
I turned that mother out.

36
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,485
Hey, you got any pliers?

37
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,893
What? Has Newman got
another Army man stuck in his ear?

38
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,058
Hilarious.

39
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,836
Newman and I are reversing
the peepholes on our door...

40
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,768
...so you can see in.

41
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,874
- Why?
- To prevent an ambush.

42
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,810
Yeah. Now, I can peek in
and see if anyone is waiting...

43
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,043
...to jack me with a sock full
of pennies.

44
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,414
But then anyone can just look in
and see you.

45
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,182
Our policy is we're comfortable
with our bodies.

46
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,122
You know, if somebody wants
to help themselves to an eyeful...

47
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,319
...well, we say enjoy the show.

48
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm sorry. I can't stay
for the second act.

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,101
Hey, George, here's the model number
on that chair, by the way.

50
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,370
- Nice wallet.
- Wallet.

51
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,972
- What?
- Nobody carries wallets anymore.

52
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,342
I mean they went out
with powdered wigs.

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,811
Here's what you need. Just a couple
of cards and your bank roll, see?

54
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,684
- Keep the big bills on the outside.
- That's a five.

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,126
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Silvio.

56
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,032
Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.

57
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,400
Hey, you know, you gotta get
permission from me.

58
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,042
I'm the super.
Who said you could do that?

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,543
Well, who says I can do any
of the things I do in my place?

60
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,204
- Like what?
- Well, like-

61
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,209
Nothing. Well, I'll switch it back.

62
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,413
No, no, no. That's all right.

63
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,217
Yeah, well, that's good.
Because Newman and I, we think-

64
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,087
- Newman? He did this too?
- Well, yeah.

65
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,453
I deal with him.

66
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,498
Look at this.
The same massage chair...

67
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,831
...we're getting for Joe Mayo,
$60 cheaper.

68
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,564
Except the store's in Delaware.

69
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,231
I'll have them overnight it.

70
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,603
Maybe cheapness is a sense.

71
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,346
You know, it is better
without this big wallet.

72
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,538
It's more comfortable.

73
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,446
It doesn't matter
if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.

74
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,055
- Why?
- Important things go in a case.

75
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,951
You got a skull for your brain...

76
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:23,619
...a plastic sleeve for your comb
and a wallet for your money.

77
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,432
Look at this thing.

78
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,293
It's huge.

79
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,831
You got more cow here than here.

80
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,242
I need everything in there.

81
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,177
Irish money?

82
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,277
I might go there.

83
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:50,282
"Show this card at any participating
Orlando area Exxon station...

84
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,551
...to get your free
Save the Tiger poster."

85
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,254
Just give me that. Give me some
of those Sweet 'N Lows.

86
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,649
- Who is it?
- It's Newman.

87
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,482
- I'm in the middle of something.
- I can't believe I'm being evicted.

88
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,956
- What are you talking about?
- The reverse peepholes.

89
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,595
Silvio says I'm an agitator
and I'm out of the building.

90
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,889
No, he can't do that.

91
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,262
I'm homeless. I'm gonna be out
on the street, dancing for nickels.

92
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,767
I'll be with the hobos
eating out of a bucket.

93
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,566
Come on, we'll go and talk to him
and we'll straighten this thing out.

94
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,003
You better put something on.

95
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,682
George, I am loving
this no-wallet thing.

96
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,417
A man carries a wallet.

97
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,926
The very fact that you oppose this
makes me think I'm onto something.

98
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,623
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Joe Mayo.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,267
- Nice place.
- Thanks.

100
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,426
Can you do me a favor
and stay by the phone...

101
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,697
...in case anybody calls
and needs directions?

102
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,204
- Love to.
- Thanks.

103
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,036
- Jerry.
- Music?

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,110
Can you keep an eye
on the aquarium...

105
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,712
...and make sure nobody
taps on the glass?

106
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,541
Well, I could do that and the music.

107
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,050
Oh, no, don't worry about the music.
Just have fun.

108
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,284
I was ready to get jiggy with it.

109
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,386
- Hey.
- Hey, Elaine.

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,959
Hey.

111
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,961
I think you know Dr. Zaius.

112
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,160
So, Elaine, notice anything different
about my pants?

113
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,667
So, George...

114
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,575
- ...did you get the chair?
- No, I don't have it yet.

115
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,405
So we're giving him nothing?

116
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,911
No, I brought a picture of the chair.

117
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,277
Did you at least get him a card?

118
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,642
I thought we'd all sign the picture.

119
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,187
- Elaine.
- Hey, Joe Mayo.

120
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,916
- I need you to be in charge of coats.
- Oh, fantastic.

121
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,354
All right.

122
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,555
There you go.

123
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,690
Puddy, can you make sure nobody
puts a drink on my sound system?

124
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,768
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.

125
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,004
Hi, I'm Jerry.
How do you like my pants?

126
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,266
Nice.

127
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,175
It's working.

128
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,311
Don't tap on the glass.

129
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,281
Joe Mayo's apartment.

130
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,641
Hey.

131
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,810
Cocktail off the speaker.

132
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,235
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.

133
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,172
Why are we in Jerry's apartment?

134
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,178
Well, I like to think of this
as my conference room.

135
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,316
Yeah, it has
a more formal atmosphere...

136
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,045
...you know, with the shelves
and the furniture.

137
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,384
Make it quick, Kramer.
My wife and I are about to go bowling.

138
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,328
Newman thinks
that you evicted him.

139
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,987
I did.

140
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,725
I don't like Mr. Newman.

141
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,003
- He is an agitator.
- Look.

142
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,298
I've known Newman all my life
in the building...

143
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,033
...and you're all wrong about him.
He's a model tenant.

144
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,667
Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.

145
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,414
- Okay. On your word, he can stay.
- All right.

146
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,577
But I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

147
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,386
Well, you won't regret it.

148
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,453
What's wrong?

149
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,028
Elaine, thanks for coming.

150
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,397
Good working with you.

151
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,169
All right, let's hit the bricks.

152
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,275
- What?
- Hey, I got a coat just like this.

153
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,487
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

154
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,648
And you threw it out the window?

155
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,622
God, you're like a rock star.

156
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,356
So now, Joe Mayo wants me
to buy him a new coat.

157
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,724
Because you threw it out.

158
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,561
No. Because I was in charge
of the coats.

159
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,566
It's insane.

160
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,932
But you did throw his coat
out the window.

161
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,835
But he doesn't know that.

162
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,771
As far as he knows,
someone stole it...

163
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,412
...and that's the person
who should be held responsible.

164
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,944
But that's you.

165
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,448
So I'll have to buy him
a new coat...

166
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:54,150
...even though I don't think I should be
held responsible, which I am anyway.

167
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,756
Well, I'm satisfied.

168
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,504
My back is killing me.

169
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,103
Of course. Because of that wallet.

170
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,771
You got a filing cabinet
under half of your ass.

171
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,350
This is an organizer...

172
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,455
...a secretary and a friend.

173
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,324
Look at you, you're on a slant.

174
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,327
Here, just give me a couple
of napkins...

175
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,300
Here. Yeah, I'm fine.

176
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,605
What was that?

177
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,210
I think I had some hard candy
in there.

178
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,408
Oh, no, this is supposed to go
to Joe Mayo's apartment.

179
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,483
How does this thing work?

180
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,159
Sir, do you want me to deliver
this chair to your friend's place or not?

181
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,194
- Ready to go?
- All set.

182
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,837
- Can't believe we're going dancing.
- You don't go often?

183
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,735
No, because it's so stupid.
Shall we?

184
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,871
Do me a favor.
Can you hold this for me?

185
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,103
Compact, lipstick, all this?

186
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,372
And can you also carry my keys?

187
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,846
What are you,
a medieval dungeon master?

188
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,678
And a tin of Altoids.

189
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,290
Sharp key.

190
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,359
So you're sleeping
with Silvio's wife?

191
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,520
Well, there's very little sleeping
going on.

192
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,666
Well, why didn't you tell me
about this?

193
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,767
I don't see how
it's any of your business.

194
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,562
Well, it's my business now.

195
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,602
Look, I stuck up for you.

196
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,570
Man, if he catches you,
we're both out.

197
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,040
Hey, what is that up that tree?

198
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,674
Man, that looks like a dead bear.

199
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,250
No. That's a fur coat.
Hey, give me a boost.

200
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,091
Where did you learn
to climb trees like that?

201
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,557
The Pacific Northwest.

202
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,401
So you had to carry
some of Keri's stuff, big deal.

203
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,540
You don't understand.
I went on a successful pocket diet...

204
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,732
...and I wanna keep that weight off.

205
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,845
You know what? We sell this thing
at Peterman that'd be perfect for you.

206
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,311
<i>Not more of that crap
from the Titanic?</i>

207
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,249
No, no. It's a small men's carryall.

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,354
I'm not carrying a purse.

209
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,854
It's not a purse. It's European.

210
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,325
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo
that chair yet?

211
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,486
I don't know.

212
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,031
If I'm getting him a new fur,
I'm not chipping in on a gift too.

213
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,624
<i>Yeah.</i>

214
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,794
George, did you get Joe Mayo
that chair yet?

215
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:57,568
Not yet. Oh, God.

216
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,544
- What?
- It's in transit.

217
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,111
- Did he get it?
- No.

218
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,208
Good. Tell him I'm out.

219
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,717
What? She's out?

220
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,652
So? You're getting a deal, right?
We'll split it three ways.

221
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,555
All right.

222
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,891
What is that noise?

223
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,858
That's my toaster. I gotta go.

224
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,002
Sometimes I get the feeling...

225
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,867
...George isn't being completely
honest with me.

226
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,008
Hey.

227
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,168
Oh, here-

228
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,844
- Here are your pliers back.
- Oh, thanks.

229
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,086
Weak hinge.

230
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,090
Well, I guess I better go
and price fur coats.

231
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,125
Go down to 88th Street.
They're free.

232
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,158
- What are you talking about?
- Well, they're hanging from the trees.

233
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,090
You know, Newman found one
there yesterday.

234
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,931
Man, that guy can climb
like a ring-tailed lemur.

235
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,038
88th Street?
That's where Joe Mayo lives.

236
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,837
That's the coat.

237
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,112
What was that pop sound?

238
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,273
Well, I had some hard candy
in there.

239
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,554
So to what do I owe
this unusual invitation?

240
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,917
Come in. Come in.

241
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,889
This is very much
as I imagined it to be.

242
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,266
Aside from this rattan piece,
which seems oddly out of place.

243
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,097
Please, sit down.

244
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,503
Newman...

245
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,005
...I wanted to talk to you
about something.

246
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,871
This isn't about my opening
your mail?

247
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,306
- What?
- I don't. Never have.

248
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,538
Anything I read was already open.

249
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,715
Yeah. No. Newman...

250
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,786
...I heard that you found
a fur coat in a tree...

251
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,422
...and I believe that it belongs
to a friend of mine...

252
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,649
...and I'd like to give it back to him.

253
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,487
Sorry, climber's keepers.

254
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,998
You know, Newmie...

255
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,598
...I know how you feel about me...

256
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,470
...and I have to tell you
I'm quite flattered.

257
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,774
- You are?
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,345
Of all the men that I know...

259
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,348
...you're the only one who's held down
a steady job for several years.

260
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,783
Well, it's interesting work.
I don't mind it.

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,581
Don't you have a boyfriend?

262
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,989
A burly, athletic type?

263
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,493
Oh, him? Oh, don't worry. He's cool.

264
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,222
- Cool?
- Very cool.

265
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,491
So, what do you say?

266
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,865
Can you do me
this one little favor, Newmie?

267
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,802
How I've waited for this moment.

268
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,773
But alas, my heart belongs
to another man's wife.

269
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,846
- And I have given the coat to her.
- All right, we're done here.

270
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,777
For I am in love with Svetlana.

271
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,612
I don't care if the whole world knows
except for Silvio...

272
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,482
...who'd throw me out of the apartment
where I'd be dancing-

273
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,783
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

274
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,390
- Nice carryall.
- It's European.

275
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,329
- Do you still have my lipstick?
- Yeah, I think I do.

276
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,900
I can never find anything in here.

277
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,569
- Oh, here it is.
- Thanks.

278
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,676
So that Joe Mayo throws
the worst parties, doesn't he?

279
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,141
What was your job?

280
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,678
My job was to keep you away
from the music.

281
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,080
What? He doesn't like
my taste in music?

282
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,239
Guess not.

283
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,747
You should have been there
last year.

284
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,412
I got jiggy with it.

285
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,156
Kramer, it's Silvio.

286
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,763
Open up, I need to talk to you.

287
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,027
I can see you
through the reverse peephole.

288
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,866
Hey, Silvio.

289
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,035
Look at this.

290
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,339
Svetlana says she find it
in the laundry room...

291
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,745
...but I think it is a gift
from that postman agitator.

292
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,441
- Where is he?
- Now, relax, Silvio.

293
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,587
No, that's it. You're both out.

294
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,019
Oh, come on. Newman
didn't even give her that.

295
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,125
No, it's that's not even
a woman's coat. That's a man's.

296
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,958
- A man's?
- Yeah.

297
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,926
What kind of a man would wear fur?

298
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,257
Oh, lots of them.

299
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,559
- Would you?
- No.

300
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,124
Then who?

301
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,466
What about Jerry?

302
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,542
- Jerry?
- Yeah, sure. He's a celebrity.

303
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,271
Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs.
They're desperate, insecure people.

304
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,271
- Yes, you are right.
- Yeah.

305
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,849
"It's all about me, me, me.

306
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,545
Please look at me. I am so pretty.

307
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,156
Love me. Want me."

308
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,659
Something like that.

309
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,324
I have to do what?

310
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,660
All you have to do is wear the fur,
so Silvio thinks it's yours.

311
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,268
I'm not wearing the fur.

312
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,928
Then Newman and I,
we get thrown out of the building.

313
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,168
Is that right?

314
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,771
All right. Why don't you just take
a good, hard look...

315
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,414
...at what your life will be like
if I'm not around?

316
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,916
- Newman too.
- Oh, come on, man.

317
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,525
If you do it, I'll give you that Walkman
you're always asking about.

318
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,661
- That's my Walkman.
- And you'll get it back.

319
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,661
- All right.
- All right. Good.

320
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,129
- Thanks. I owe you one.
- Hey.

321
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Hey, and by the way, that Walkman
was broke when you gave it to me.

322
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,904
- You get that chair?
- It gets here when it gets here.

323
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,166
Would you stop riding me?

324
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,867
You know what,
just call up and cancel it. I'm out.

325
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,307
Excuse me?

326
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,643
Joe doesn't like my taste in music.
He's not getting a gift from me.

327
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,681
I can't believe
you're dropping out too?

328
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,377
So now, Kramer and I have to pay
for the entire gift.

329
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,446
Now, who's this Joe Mayo
everyone's talking about?

330
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,451
He's the guy we're buying
the chair for, remember?

331
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,994
It was your suggestion.

332
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,758
I think the chair is
a fantastic gift idea...

333
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,367
...but I never heard
of this Joe Mayo.

334
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,596
And frankly, it sounds made-up.

335
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,836
Oh, so now I have to buy
the whole chair by myself?

336
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,842
- No. You don't have to buy anything.
- I already bought it.

337
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,971
I've been lying to you for three days
and now you're all screwing me.

338
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,577
I don't understand.
Why didn't you tell us?

339
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,052
I needed it.
My back is a little tweaked.

340
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,817
Because of your giant wallet.
Just get rid of it.

341
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,858
Never. It is a part of me.

342
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,519
I will just return the chair
and it will be easy...

343
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,530
...because the receipt
is in my good friend.

344
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,064
Your good friend is morbidly obese.

345
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,639
Well, at least
I'm not carrying a purse.

346
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,939
It's not a purse. It's European.

347
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,282
All right, Silvio's down there,
he's shoveling the walk.

348
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,146
All you gotta do is put this on,
you go down to the corner...

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,912
...you pick up a paper
and come back.

350
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,715
- All right.
- There you go.

351
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,323
How do I look?

352
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,253
Odd.

353
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,900
"Learn guitar. First lesson free."

354
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:28,485
My receipts. The chair.
My tiger poster.

355
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,292
Hey, Silvio. Just out for a little stroll
in my favorite fur coat.

356
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,894
- That is your coat?
- It sure is.

357
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,596
Kramer says you need it...

358
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,795
...because you're an entertainer
and you're desperate for attention.

359
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,440
That's true.

360
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,836
- Jerry, you forgot your purse.
- Oh, thanks.

361
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,236
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here...

362
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,746
...prancing around in his coat
with his purse.

363
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,484
Yup, he's a dandy.
He's a real fancy boy.

364
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,184
Maybe this isn't my coat.

365
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,988
- Yeah, all right, you're not fancy.
- No. He's very fancy.

366
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,859
"Want me. Love me.
Shower me with kisses."

367
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,297
Jerry, where'd you get it?
That's his coat.

368
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,671
No, it's not. It's mine.
I'm a fancy boy.

369
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,370
That's not your coat.

370
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,673
If that is not his coat,
who's coat is it?

371
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,544
It's Joe Mayo's coat.

372
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,810
Who's Joe Mayo?

373
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,887
It must be the man
that's sleeping with your wife.

374
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,188
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

375
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,555
- Officer.
- There he goes.

376
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,958
Somebody took
my European carryall.

377
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,257
Your what?

378
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,662
The black leather thing with a strap.

379
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,823
You mean a purse?

380
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,407
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse.

381
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,375
So Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?

382
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,745
Yeah, he's waiting inside
his apartment for him...

383
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,149
...with a sock full of pennies.

384
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,146
Should have had
a reverse peephole.

385
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,691
Hey, babe.

386
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,629
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

387
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,389
What is that?

388
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,998
It's my new coat.

389
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,766
What? You ditched the fur?

390
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,372
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his.
He looked like a bit of a dandy.

391
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,040
Check it out.

392
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,732
Eight ball.

393
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,173
"You got a question?
You ask the 8 Ball."

394
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,915
You're gonna wear this all the time?

395
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,077
All signs point to yes.
