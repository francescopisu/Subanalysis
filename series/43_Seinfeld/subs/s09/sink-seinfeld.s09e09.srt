1
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,897
Any second now.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,203
It's light is on.

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,845
Melissa, waffles are ready.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,675
Oh, fantastic. I'm starving.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,541
How about that?

6
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,557
She ate breakfast naked?

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,462
She didn't even want a napkin.

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,262
I've had bedroom naked,
I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,704
I have never had living-room naked.

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,371
Oh, it's a scene.

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,138
It's like you're living
in the Playboy Mansion.

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,244
Did she-? Did she frolic?

13
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,850
I don't have enough room.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,215
- Hey, Laney, Puddy.
- Hey.

15
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,446
- Hi.
- Hey.

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,285
- I gotta make a pit stop.
- Okay.

17
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,517
Back together?

18
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,459
His apartment was being fumigated.
We thought we'd give it another shot.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,223
So guess who called me last night?
Jason Hanky.

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,165
"Stanky" Hanky? What did he want?

21
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,101
He called to apologize
for standing me up five years ago.

22
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,400
Why now?

23
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,635
A.A. It's one of the 12 steps.

24
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,746
Step number 9 is
you have to apologize...

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,405
...to everyone you've ever wronged.

26
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,485
I can't wait for Hanky
to come crawling back to me.

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,122
Still with the neck hole?

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,781
- Still upset. Very upset.
- What neck hole?

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,018
Remember that party
he threw a few years ago?

30
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,255
He had that very drafty apartment.
- I think on 9th Avenue-

31
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,420
Faster.

32
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,560
- I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
- A cashmere sweater.

33
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,503
I said, preferably cashmere.
For warmth.

34
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,370
I front of the whole party,
he says:

35
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,671
"No. I don't want you stretching out
the neck hole."

36
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,380
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up.
Everybody else did.

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,951
Well, it's funny.
I mean, you have a big head.

38
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,982
Or is it because of your neck?

39
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,558
No, I think the head does
most of the stretching.

40
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,060
Regardless, I had to walk around
for the rest of the party...

41
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,565
...in some cheap MetLife Windbreaker.
Now it is payback time.

42
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,227
- I really think it's the size of your neck.
- It's my head.

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,635
- Hey, isn't this great?
- Hey.

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,541
Since the nerds in Accounting
moved...

45
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,545
...we're the only ones
in this bathroom.

46
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,978
Yeah. Great.

47
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,356
You went to the coffee shop
without me.

48
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,724
I told you I just wanted to hop
in the shower.

49
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,093
That's an hour ago.
What were you doing in there?

50
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,667
Showering.
How long does it take you?

51
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,701
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

52
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,964
That's kooky talk.

53
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,602
Elaine, how long do you spend
in the shower?

54
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,540
- Ten minutes.
- Let me smell you.

55
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
All right. Whiff away.

56
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,945
It's not bad at all.

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,515
- That's it.
- Okay.

58
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,753
So get this. I'm in the bathroom
at work today...

59
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,360
...and I see Peggy using
a seat protector.

60
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,326
- So?
- We're the only women on the floor.

61
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,295
I mean, we're like roommates.

62
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,560
Would you use a seat protector
if you had a roommate?

63
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,632
The damage is probably
already done.

64
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,538
- All right. I'll get that.
- All right. It's just-

65
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,112
Maybe she just practices
good hygiene.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,149
Yeah, you're right. She's probably one
of those neurotic clean freaks.

67
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,654
Well, here's my shower routine.
Maybe I can make some changes.

68
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,986
Yeah, wash cloth mittens
and maybe some liquid soap...

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,958
...and just... focus.

70
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,391
Zephyr? That is not a word.

71
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,592
- Do you challenge?
- No, I do not challenge.

72
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,135
Sixty-six points.

73
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,502
I'd accuse you of cheating,
but where would you hide the tiles?

74
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,676
- You want some more iced tea?
- Sure.

75
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,447
Wrong pipe.

76
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,449
So she coughed.

77
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,288
Coughing? Naked?

78
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,589
It's a turnoff, man.

79
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,589
Everything goes with naked.

80
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,100
When you cough, there are
thousands of unseen muscles...

81
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,296
...that suddenly spring into action.

82
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,505
It's like watching a fat guy
catch a cannonball...

83
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,871
...in his stomach in slow motion.

84
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,577
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man.

85
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,740
You know how much mental energy
I expend...

86
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,511
...trying to picture women naked?

87
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,384
But the thing you don't realize is
there's good naked and bad naked.

88
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:56,290
Naked hair brushing, good.
Naked crouching, bad.

89
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,731
- Hey, there's Hanky.
- All right, it's grovel time.

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,334
Hey, George. Jerry.

91
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,902
Listen, I just got sober...

92
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,164
...so I've been going
through the 12 steps.

93
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,706
What are you up to now? Step 9?

94
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,841
Yeah. Making amends.

95
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,775
Important step.

96
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,472
Maybe the most important.

97
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,247
Anyway, Jerry, you know,
this may sound dumb...

98
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,322
...but when we first met,
I thought your name was Gary.

99
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,152
I think I may even have called you
Gary a couple of times.

100
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,989
I don't know if you noticed,
but I always felt bad.

101
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,391
So I'm sorry.

102
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,864
Thank you. I did notice
and I appreciate you rectifying it.

103
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,401
Great. Great.

104
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,833
Well, I'll see you guys later.

105
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,114
Well, I just got out
of a 27-minute shower.

106
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,014
I made some good cuts
and I didn't lose anything I needed.

107
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,587
Yeah, I think what I kept is
even stronger now.

108
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,057
- You've got some suds over here.
- What?

109
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,457
Oh, man.

110
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,120
Jeez. Look at that: I'm all lathery.

111
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,631
Jerry, you gotta show me
what I'm doing wrong.

112
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,032
- Oh, come on.
- No, I mean it, man. I'm lost.

113
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,673
You promise you'll never come
in here again?

114
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,935
Well, Jerry, you know I can't do that.

115
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,538
My sense of it is you're probably
wasting time working piecemeal:

116
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,707
- First cleaning one area, then another.
- Well, that's how cats do it.

117
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,217
But when you have a faucet
instead of a tongue...

118
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,413
...you wanna use gravity.

119
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,387
Okay, let's turn the water on now.

120
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,549
No, I told you. It's just a dry run.

121
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,598
Hanky's moved on to Step 10.

122
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,735
- He was taking personal inventory.
- That's Step 10?

123
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,962
He has to do is count his blessings,
say a prayer and he's done.

124
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,163
You believe this?

125
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,774
Come on, Jerry,
how about a baggy swimsuit?

126
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,910
No. You're not getting
any skin, Kramer.

127
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,179
Well, this has all been
one big tease.

128
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,547
These proofs look pretty good.

129
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,019
Oh, can I move this?

130
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,620
Yup. I think this will work.

131
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,595
I'm gonna get another bottle
of water.

132
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,858
Here, take mine. There's a little left.

133
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,093
Oh, thanks, Walter.

134
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,039
Guys, there's no doubt
that the pay is good.

135
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,709
But I just don't know if I see myself
working with ice cream.

136
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,320
You get pretty buff forearms.

137
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,484
I don't know if I'm into that.

138
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,319
- Oh, hello, Hanky, others.
- George.

139
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,726
You know, Jason,
I couldn't help notice:

140
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,456
I didn't get my apology.

141
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,629
Apology? For what?

142
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,135
A drafty apartment.
A sweaterless friend.

143
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,742
A ball game giveaway
MetLife Windbreaker.

144
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,571
George, come on.
Not that neck-hole thing.

145
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,905
Yes, the neck-hole thing.

146
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,071
I'd appreciate it
if you'd say you're sorry.

147
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,707
No way. You would have
completely stretched it out.

148
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,151
You're an alcoholic.
You have to apologize.

149
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,814
Step 9. Step 9.

150
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,095
All right, George, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

151
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,994
I'm so sorry that I didn't want
your rather bulbous head...

152
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,136
...struggling to find its way
into the normal-size neck hole...

153
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,895
...of my finely knit sweater.

154
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:41,082
Now, see, that's smart.
Constant motion.

155
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,353
- Hey.
- Oh, yeah. I'm watching you too...

156
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,789
...but this guy's really
showing me something.

157
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,759
You got a steak?

158
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,295
What happened to you?

159
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,456
People in this city are crazy.

160
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,726
Here you go.

161
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,460
Thanks, buddy.

162
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:02,131
Oh, yes. Yeah, you got any A.1.,
because I'm cooking a steak.

163
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,969
- What?
- A different one.

164
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,005
Okay, Jerry. I fixed that bike.

165
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,274
That wasn't really necessary.
I don't ride it. It's just for show.

166
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,651
I gotta clean those bearings.
Hold this.

167
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,284
- Look at all that gunk.
- Please, don't crouch.

168
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,716
- It caught my skin.
- Oh, that's bad.

169
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,656
Especially that area.

170
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,455
You got anything to snack on?

171
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,598
Oh, pickles.

172
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,165
It's a tough one.

173
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,864
Please stop.
Let me help you with that.

174
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,380
It's gonna leave a welt.
Look at that.

175
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,607
I can't. I can't look anymore.

176
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,275
I've seen too much.

177
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,151
Peggy, we gotta talk.

178
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,487
What is it about me
that you find so offensive?

179
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,794
- You seem to be with a lot of men.
- What?

180
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,764
I happen to have
a very steady boyfriend.

181
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,669
You know, I mean,
we broke up a few times...

182
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,570
...and there has been
an occasional guy here or there, but-

183
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,335
Why is this your business?

184
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,945
It's not. Good day.

185
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,182
Oh, all right.
You think I've got germs?

186
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,545
I'll give you some germs.

187
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,120
How about some
for your keyboard, huh?

188
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,153
How about that? Yeah?

189
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,814
Oh, how about for your stapler?

190
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,154
That's good, isn't it?
You have a happy and a healthy.

191
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,539
Well, technically, he did apologize.

192
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,076
Jerry, I felt like a straight man
in some horrible sketch.

193
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,807
He was riffing. Riffing. On my pain.

194
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,544
You want an apology for the apology
plus the original apology?

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,415
That's right. I'm two in the hole.

196
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,151
Well, I hit the wall yesterday
with Lady Godiva.

197
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,920
She did a full-body flex
on a pickle jar.

198
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,160
Did you explain about the good naked
and the bad naked?

199
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,393
Where am I gonna get a fat guy
and a cannonball?

200
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,742
Well, what if you showed her
bad naked, huh?

201
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,408
- You still got that belt sander?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, you on all fours,
that thing vibrating...

203
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,708
...kicking up sawdust.

204
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,046
She'll get the picture.

205
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,688
<i>- Hello?
- Jerry, guess where I'm calling from?</i>

206
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,726
<i>- World War I plane?
- No, I'm in my shower.</i>

207
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,955
I'm trying to get out
of the shower sooner.

208
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,692
And then I asked myself why.
I mean, this is where I wanna be.

209
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,496
I got a waterproof phone, I shaved,
I brushed my teeth...

210
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,640
...and I ordered a pair of chinos
from J. Crew.

211
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,539
- When are you getting out?
- I'm not. I'll see you later, buddy.

212
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,278
Bad news, people.
Peggy is home sick.

213
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,918
Oh, please.

214
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,886
She's stuffed up, achy
and suffering from intense malaise.

215
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,959
Oh, come on.
We all have intense malaise, right?

216
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,029
I just spoke with her, Elaine.

217
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,222
She's in bed.

218
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,027
Yeah. Let me tell you something.
This is all in her mind.

219
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,294
She is insane.

220
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,871
She thinks I made her sick
because I coughed on her doorknob...

221
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,500
...rubbed her stapler in my armpit
and put her keyboard on my butt.

222
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,077
Yeah. She's a wacko.

223
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,281
- So you're Jason Hanky's supervisor.
- Sponsor.

224
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,355
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned
about this guy.

225
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,357
He's doing very well.
He's already on to Step 10.

226
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,858
If you don't do the steps...

227
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,791
...you can go through them
pretty fast.

228
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,761
You can get through six a day.

229
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,366
Is there some unresolved issue
between you and Jason?

230
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,397
I don't know, a little something called,
Step 9?

231
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:58,032
Instead of an apology he was
bebopping and scatting all over me.

232
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,171
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

233
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,870
Well, aren't you the boss of him?

234
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,514
You shouldn't let him move up.

235
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,116
When I was in Cub Scouts,
I got stuck on Webelos...

236
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,482
...for three years because I kept losing
the Pinewood Derby.

237
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,214
You're quite upset.

238
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,620
I think you should drop him down
to Step 2.

239
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,283
Admit there's a higher power?

240
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,656
Yeah, let him chew on that
for a while.

241
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,223
You know, George,
I think I can help you.

242
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,629
We're having a meeting.
Why don't you come by?

243
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,669
All right. That's more like it.
Thank you very much.

244
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,774
By the way,
my uncle was an alcoholic.

245
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,240
Lomez, you're not listening.
Jerry likes the naked.

246
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,874
It's just some of the things
that she does when she's naked.

247
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,446
Calm down. I'm on your side.

248
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,721
Jeez. Hey, hold on a second.

249
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,426
I got a clog. I'll call you back.

250
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,297
- What are you doing?
- I found a spot on the kitchen floor.

251
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,769
I thought I'd polish it up
with this belt sander I have here.

252
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,701
No, not that. Why are you naked?

253
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,609
- I thought naked is good.
- This isn't good naked.

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,348
George, here have a seat.

255
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,917
Where's Hanky?

256
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,018
Okay, let's get started.

257
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,185
Welcome to
Rage-aholics Anonymous.

258
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,298
- What? Rage-aholics?
- George, this can help you.

259
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,264
Hey, I am not here for rage.
I'm here for revenge.

260
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,031
Excuse me. We have
a no-yelling policy at these meetings.

261
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:39,306
Excuse me. Am I talking to you,
pinhead? Am I?

262
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,445
Please, don't call me pinhead.

263
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,012
I'm losing it.

264
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,378
He took you to Rage-aholics?
Why?

265
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,788
Probably because this whole universe
is against me.

266
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,651
- You got a little rage.
- I know.

267
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,993
And now, they want me to bottle it up.
It makes me so mad.

268
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,661
By the way, my bad naked demo
didn't quite work.

269
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,800
This bread has nuts in it.

270
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,108
Oh, great, Elaine.

271
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,743
What is wrong with my body?

272
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,277
Chicken wing shoulder blades.

273
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,739
- That's it?
- No, but that's one problem. Why?

274
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,750
I was walking around naked
in front of Melissa the other day-

275
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,115
Walking around naked?

276
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,757
That is not a good look for a man.

277
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,259
Why not?
It's a good look for a woman.

278
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,763
Well, female body is a work of art.

279
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,530
The male body is utilitarian.
It's for getting around. It's like a Jeep.

280
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,770
- So you don't think it's attractive?
- It's hideous.

281
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,210
The hair, the lumpiness.

282
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,009
It's simian.

283
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,778
Well, some women like it.

284
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,887
Sickies.

285
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,491
"Installing your Clarkman
garbage disposal.

286
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,791
Dismantle latch hasp
beneath main drainage line."

287
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,161
Oh, come on, Clarkman.

288
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,335
- Puddy.
- Is David Puddy there?

289
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,307
- This is Puddy.
- Oh, this is Kramer.

290
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,810
I know.

291
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,478
You're a mechanic. Could you help me
install a garbage disposal?

292
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,815
You gotta dismantle the latch hasp
from the auxiliary drainage line.

293
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,957
- No, it says main line.
- It's a misprint.

294
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,592
- What do you got, a Clarkman?
- Yeah.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,660
I'll call you. I'll talk you through it.

296
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,228
Oh, okay. Well, thanks, Puddy.

297
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,325
- Hey, Puddy.
- Hey, babe, your boss called.

298
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,366
You owe 5 bucks
for a balloon bouquet.

299
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,699
Yeah, he says you can just give it
to him tomorrow when you see him.

300
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,340
Balloon bouquet for who?

301
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,169
Peggy took a turn for the worse.

302
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:56,169
Peggy? Great.
I suppose she's still blaming me?

303
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,576
- He said so.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,615
I don't believe this woman.

305
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,650
Talk to me, babe.

306
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,546
She's this crazy woman...

307
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,556
...who is convinced
that my germs make her sick.

308
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,626
Oh, a germaphobe.

309
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,695
I know what that's about.

310
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,264
I'm a recovering germaphobe.

311
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,599
Ten years.

312
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,238
- What is this symbol?
- It's a germ.

313
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,470
It was very nice of you
to bring the man...

314
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,478
...you're sleeping with to talk...

315
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:35,712
...but I assure you,
I don't have any problem with germs.

316
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,947
Don't you? Elaine.

317
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,983
Please.

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,458
I know it looks bleak.
I've been there.

319
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,097
Ten years ago, waking up
next to a woman liked this...

320
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,756
...would have sent me running
for the pHisoHex.

321
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,433
- Really?
- I still have trouble looking...

322
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,970
...at those disgusting old bedroom
slippers she slobs around in.

323
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,973
Hey, I've had those since college.
They're bunnies.

324
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,338
They're bacteria traps.

325
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,912
So you just learned to live with it?

326
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,106
For the most part.

327
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,844
Okay. We're broken up
for the rest of the day.

328
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,748
So I'm glad we had a talk
and worked this out.

329
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,119
- Don't you feel this is better?
- This is nice.

330
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,194
Yes, clothes. This is normal.

331
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,260
What are you doing tomorrow?

332
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,229
I was thinking that we could go-

333
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,367
Jerry?

334
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,871
Jerry, are you listening to me?

335
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah. What? I'm sorry.

336
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,006
I wanted to know
what you were doing tomorrow.

337
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,182
Maybe a haircut and I don't know,
maybe this and-

338
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,387
So you broke up.

339
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,492
We couldn't carry on
a conversation.

340
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,389
I kept trying to picture her naked...

341
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,996
...she kept trying
to not picture me naked.

342
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,623
Hang on.

343
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,795
So, what are you up to?

344
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,738
Oh, just cooking up
a little thank-you for Puddy.

345
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,172
Hey, how do you make
those radish roses?

346
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,312
Insert a knife into the center
and twist.

347
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,915
Then to make it bloom, soak it in water
for 30 to 40 minutes.

348
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,743
No problem there.

349
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,513
George, thanks for coming down
to talk.

350
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,921
I wanted to see you right away,
but my hours here aren't so flexible.

351
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,493
I just started yesterday.

352
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,391
Well, I'm here. What is it?

353
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,627
Well, I talked to my sponsor...

354
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,461
...and I've thought it over
and you know...

355
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,662
...my apology at the coffee shop
was sarcastic and rude...

356
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,431
...and you deserve much better.

357
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,169
Well, thank you.

358
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,833
You're welcome.

359
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,305
- Can I get a triple Minute Man Mint?
- Waffle or sugar cone?

360
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,780
Excuse me, Jason.

361
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:53,385
I don't wanna get into a big thing here
but I'm not sure if technically...

362
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,087
...what you just said was actually
an apology.

363
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,026
- What?
- Can you get on that cone?

364
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,225
Would you hang on just a second?
What are you talking about?

365
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,702
All you said was, "You're welcome."
Which is nice. It's very nice.

366
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,364
But I feel I gotta get the apology.

367
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,909
- Is there anybody else here but you?
- I'm alone and it's my second day.

368
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,412
You know, I don't even think
we have that flavor, so-

369
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,312
George, really, enough, okay?

370
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,044
I admitted I was wrong.
What more do you want from me?

371
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,950
- I want an apology.
- All right, look-

372
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,386
- Did you try it?
- He doesn't know what he's doing.

373
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,890
Oh, yes, I do. Yes, I do.

374
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,928
I'm interacting with someone here,
if you can understand that.

375
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,530
- Now, I'm sorry.
- There it is.

376
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,634
You said it. That's what I want.
Say it again and tell it to me.

377
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,363
I'm not saying anything to you.
I'm not sorry. I was never sorry.

378
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,269
It was cashmere. I hate Step 9.

379
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,036
Where's that Rum Raisin?
Where is it?

380
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,908
I can't find anything. I need a drink.

381
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,879
Daiquiri Ice. Here we go.

382
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,176
What are you looking at?

383
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,478
Get out. Come on.

384
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,622
Can't you see we're closed?
Get out.

385
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,818
This food is fantastic, Kramer.

386
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,089
- And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
- Well, thank you.

387
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,965
Well, here's to Peggy on her first week
of being germfree free.

388
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,495
Yeah.

389
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,766
And here's to David Puddy for helping
me install a much-needed...

390
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,708
...and much-appreciated
garbage disposal in my bathtub.

391
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,240
Yeah.

392
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,539
You have a garbage disposal
in your bathtub?

393
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,617
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time.

394
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,447
I made this whole meal in there.

395
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,721
This food was in the shower
with you?

396
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,018
I prepared it as I bathed.

397
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,190
Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!

398
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,504
Excuse me? Is this Rage-aholics?

399
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,409
- No. Germaphobes.
- Thanks.

400
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,246
What are you guys doing here?

401
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,885
- Kramer.
- Right.

402
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,152
Hi, I'm Jason.

403
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,326
- I'm a Rage-aholic.
- Hi, Jason.

404
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,558
- This is my first meeting.
- Step-skipper.

405
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,496
That man is a step-skipper.
He skips Step 9.

406
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,931
- Please, Step 9.
- That's right.

407
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,400
He never apologized to me...

408
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,268
...for saying that I would stretch out
the neck hole on his sweater.

409
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,340
It wasn't funny.

410
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,410
It was a very nice sweater.

411
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,379
Take a look at his neck, not to mention
the melon sitting on top of it.

412
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,348
I don't know if I'd trust him
with a V-neck.

413
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,845
He's bebopping and scatting,
and I'm losing it.
