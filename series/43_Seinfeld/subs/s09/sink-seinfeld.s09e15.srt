1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,196
When are they gonna learn that news
about China is an instant page-turner?

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,364
What's that?

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,772
It's a Wizard electronic organizer
for my dad.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,175
- I'm going to Florida for his birthday.
- How much?

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,678
Two hundred. I'll tell him 50.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,579
He doesn't care for the gift,
he gets excited about the deal.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,845
Where are you getting
a Wizard for $50?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,253
I'll tell him I got it on the street and
maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,724
I got a message from the Rosses
at work today.

10
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,056
Susan's parents?
When's the last time you talked?

11
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,156
At the funeral, give or take.

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,033
Deep down I always kind of felt that
they blamed me for Susan's death.

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,695
Why? Because you picked out
the poison envelopes?

14
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,937
That's silly.

15
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,974
Darryl, these are people I know.

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,244
Jerry, George.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,514
Nice meeting you. I gotta run,
Elaine. I'll see you later.

18
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,156
Okay.

19
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,716
Still no Puddy?

20
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,461
I think his answering machine's
broken, so I just gave up.

21
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,689
What do you think?

22
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,334
What, about you dating a black guy?
What's the big deal?

23
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,495
- What black guy?
- Darryl. He's black, isn't he?

24
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,573
He is?

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,540
- No, he isn't.
- Isn't he, Elaine?

26
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,077
- You think?
- I thought he looked Irish.

27
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,415
- What's his last name?
- Nelson.

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,676
- That's not Irish.
- I think he's black.

29
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,183
Should we talking about this?

30
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,321
- I think it's okay.
- No, it isn't.

31
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,252
- Why not?
- Well, it would be okay...

32
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,914
...if Darryl was here.

33
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,425
- If he's black.
- Is he black?

34
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,584
Does it matter?

35
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,323
No, of course not.
I mean, I'd just like to know.

36
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,195
- So you need to know?
- No, I don't need to know.

37
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,962
I just think it would be nice
if I knew.

38
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,298
Shall I take that?

39
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,770
- One sec.
- Oh, here.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,203
Oh, yeah, hang on.

41
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,284
- Mrs. Ross, it's George.
- Who?

42
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,356
George Costanza. Susan's friend?

43
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,654
Long time no speak.

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,889
We're all out of lime juice.

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,000
I told that woman to buy more.

46
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,898
George,
the Susan Ross Foundation...

47
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,971
...is having an event this weekend.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,305
Oh, I just leased a house
out in the Hamptons...

49
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,572
...and I have got to get out there
this weekend and sign the papers.

50
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,375
I'm going back to bed.

51
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,747
<i>- Thank you for calling, George.
- Oh, sure.</i>

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,218
I mean, after all,
you were almost my...

53
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,857
Okay, I gotta go.

54
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,220
House in the Hamptons?

55
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,226
I've been lying about my income
for years.

56
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,298
I figured I could afford a fake
house in the Hamptons.

57
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,296
- Well.
- Hey.

58
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,495
Well, grab a cigar, boys.

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,162
Yeah, it's time to celebrate.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,173
- What are we celebrating?
- You remember my coffee table book?

61
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,776
With the little legs.

62
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,640
That's the one.

63
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:06,009
A big Hollywood so-and-so
optioned it for a movie.

64
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,849
How are they gonna make
that book into a movie?

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,619
Remember that photo book
on toy ray guns?

66
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,888
<i>- Yeah.
- Independence Day?</i>

67
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,564
How much are they paying you?

68
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's just say I don't have to
worry about working for a while.

69
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,261
A long while.

70
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,803
That's funny, because
I haven't seen you working...

71
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:34,037
...for a while. A long while.

72
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,546
And you're not going to,
because I'm hanging it up.

73
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,049
Boys, I'm retiring.

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,517
From what?

75
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,281
From the grind.
I mean, who needs it?

76
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,085
You know, I've accomplished
everything I've set out to do.

77
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,217
What's that?

78
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,364
Oh, bought myself
a little retirement gift.

79
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,727
A gold watch.

80
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,933
It's not really gold.

81
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,983
- Hey.
- Hey, great music.

82
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,710
Oh, it's my neighbor.

83
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,253
They blast that stuff
24 hours a day. I hate it.

84
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,185
Turn it down!

85
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,597
Oh, wow. These are nice.

86
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,462
Do they have any
cultural significance?

87
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,797
They're African.

88
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,329
Right.

89
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,408
- African.
- Well, not " Africa."

90
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,044
Actually South Africa.

91
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,510
South Africa.

92
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,380
My family used to live there. We got
out years ago. For obvious reasons.

93
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,386
- You know how it is.
- Maybe.

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,350
You must hate hot dogs, huh?

95
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,529
Or else you really like them
and that's why you do this.

96
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,795
If I had one of these things
I'd be eating hot dogs all the time.

97
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,802
You gonna buy a hot dog or not?

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,830
No.

99
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,246
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

100
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,250
It's 5:30 in the morning.

101
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,081
We let you sleep in.

102
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,291
Well, as long as I'm up,
Dad, I got you a birthday present.

103
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,055
Here. Happy birthday.

104
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,995
Oh, Jerry. I should be
buying you presents.

105
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,563
What does that mean?

106
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,830
Leave your father alone.
It's his birthday.

107
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,736
It's a radar detector.

108
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,772
Radar detector. I've never seen
you go over 20 miles an hour.

109
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,644
You're like the grand marshal
of the Rose Bowl parade.

110
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,482
It's a Wizard organizer.

111
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,021
This looks like too much money.

112
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,921
No, I got it from a guy on the street.
It was like 50 bucks.

113
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,857
- You think it's hot?
- Could be.

114
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,432
Attaboy. Helen, Jerry got me
a hot Wizard computer.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,727
I'm right here.

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,862
You can do everything with it. You can
get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,201
So I can use it to figure out the tip?

118
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,539
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool
thing is the daily planner.

119
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,976
We can go to the restaurant
to figure out the tips.

120
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,548
Jerry, you're getting your
father too excited.

121
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,446
Hey, buddy. When did you get in?

122
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,789
Kramer, what are you doing here?

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,895
I told you I was retiring.
I moved in next door.

124
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,632
Mr. Cornstein died,
and it's a beautiful apartment.

125
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,237
Yeah, your folks said it was for rent,
so I jumped on it.

126
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,702
Kramer, you can't live down here.

127
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,776
This is where people come to die.

128
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,404
Not you.

129
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,173
Older people.

130
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,148
Don't eat cookies for breakfast.

131
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,085
I'll fix you something.
How about a feta cheese omelet?

132
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,781
That sounds great, Mom.

133
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,926
You feed him he'll never leave.

134
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,928
I don't have any feta. How about
cottage cheese and egg beaters?

135
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,657
I guess.

136
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,064
- I don't believe this.
- I know, I know.

137
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,863
Don't I look more relaxed?

138
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,638
So, George, do you have any
thoughts on this Darryl situation?

139
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,207
Actually, I did have a thought.

140
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,373
Why don't you just ask him?

141
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:07,781
Because if I ask him,
then it's like I really want to know.

142
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,154
Maybe he's...

143
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,660
...mixed.

144
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,859
Is that the right word?

145
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,554
I don't think we're supposed
to be talking about this.

146
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,565
- I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
- You know what? I'm leaving.

147
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,568
- I'll talk to Jerry when he gets back.
- All right.

148
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,170
Oh, Mrs. Ross. Mr. Ross.

149
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,844
Oh, you're George's friend.

150
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,276
We saw him in the city
this weekend.

151
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,508
What happened to his place
in the Hamptons?

152
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:43,712
The Hamptons? George Costanza?

153
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,289
I don't think so.

154
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,959
Have a good one.

155
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,227
Rosses.

156
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,602
George. We were just
talking about you.

157
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,006
Well, sorry I missed
that charity thing...

158
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,079
...but this was one of those truly
glorious Hampton weekends...

159
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,046
- ...that you always hear about.
- Really?

160
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,879
Yeah, I may move out there.

161
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,581
I mean it. I'll do it.

162
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,725
Okay, I'll see you later.

163
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,720
Keep it real.

164
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,928
Another fine meal. And now
for my Wizard tip calculator.

165
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,401
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.

166
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,201
Don't worry.
I'll get to the other functions.

167
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,433
I can't get it open.

168
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,447
Yay, Jerry got it open.

169
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,078
The service was slow, and God
forbid they should refill the water.

170
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,782
How does 12.4 percent sound?

171
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:59,031
Well, your tip is
$4 and 36.6666 cents.

172
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,825
We'll round down.

173
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,426
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come
down here on your father's birthday.

174
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,937
You've helped take his mind
off the condo election.

175
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,769
Right. You can't run for
condo president because you were...

176
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,605
- ...impeached at the other condo.
- I was never impeached.

177
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,576
I resigned.

178
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,182
Even so, the press would bury him.

179
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,444
What press?

180
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,951
<i>The condo newsletter.
The Boca Breeze.</i>

181
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,717
Pinko commie rag.

182
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,623
Hey, Morty. Your boy here.

183
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,789
He just got a date with that
young aquacise instructor.

184
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,832
She's 50.

185
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,905
You know what he's got?
He's got charisma.

186
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,631
- That's my man.
- I'll see you guys.

187
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,036
Yeah.

188
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,470
Yeah.

189
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,985
Morty, what are you looking at?

190
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,879
I'll tell you what I'm looking at.

191
00:10:55,054 --> 00:11:00,856
The next condo board president
of Del Boca Vista, phase three.

192
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,433
Elaine, thank you for the Wizard.

193
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,234
Wow, it's got so many functions.

194
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,167
Yeah, yeah, forget about all that.

195
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,207
First thing is first,
warranty information.

196
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,368
Name. We know that. Hobbies.

197
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,878
- Skiing, racquetball-
- Well, I don't do that stuff.

198
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,574
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

199
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,379
Oh, Here's one. Race.

200
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,282
Isn't that optional?

201
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:35,393
It certainly should be.
It's nobody's damn business.

202
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,861
But they really would like to know.

203
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,200
- All right. I'm Asian.
- What?

204
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,630
Just to mess with them.

205
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,529
Right. Good one.

206
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,234
Average income.
Over a hundred thousand.

207
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,308
- Really?
- So does that matter?

208
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,647
No. But it's very nice to know.

209
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,682
So did you figure out Darryl's...

210
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,926
...you know?

211
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,224
I've given up. So now we're going
to a bunch of Spanish restaurants.

212
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,230
Figure that'll cover us either way.

213
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,168
You're a master of race relations.

214
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,569
So Kramer's running
for president of the condo?

215
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,278
Yeah. It's all my father's doing.

216
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,274
He wants to install Kramer
in a puppet regime...

217
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,746
...and then wield power
from behind the scenes.

218
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,647
Preferably from the sauna
in the clubhouse.

219
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,581
- Who are they running against?
- Common sense...

220
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,748
...and a guy in a wheelchair.

221
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,119
- Jerry?
- He's still down with his folks.

222
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,592
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,629
- Elaine. Elaine.
- I'm getting his mail.

224
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,529
- Oh, no.
- He asked you to get the mail?

225
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,870
Jerry,
why is Elaine getting your mail?

226
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,997
George, listen to me.
I have a very important job for you.

227
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,339
I want you to come by twice a day...

228
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,539
...and flush the toilet
so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.

229
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,610
- What?
- Well, what about the mail?

230
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,312
This is far more important.

231
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,822
You must exercise the gaskets,
George.

232
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,263
All right, Jerry, I'll do it. See you.

233
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,229
So, ran into the Rosses again.

234
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,233
Oh, right, at the coffee shop.

235
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,737
Where did they get the idea that you
have a place in the Hamptons?

236
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,512
- From me.
- What did you say?

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,547
I told them I have a place
in the Hamptons.

238
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,309
What did you say?

239
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,975
I told them you didn't.

240
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:46,651
And I laughed and I laughed.

241
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,727
So they know.

242
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,591
- Those liars.
- But you lied first.

243
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,063
But they let me go on and on
all about the Hamptons.

244
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,326
They never said a thing.

245
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,402
You don't let somebody lie
when you know.

246
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,835
- You call them a liar.
- Like you're a liar.

247
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,940
Yes. Thank you. Was that so hard?

248
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:07,408
So this is over? Not over?
I'm betting not over.

249
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,744
Not by a long shot.

250
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,815
I'm calling the Rosses
and inviting them...

251
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,849
...to my nonexistent place
in the Hamptons.

252
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,385
Then we'll see who blinks first.

253
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,618
Haven't you done enough
to these people?

254
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,330
This is not about them.
Now if you'll excuse me...

255
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,728
...I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.

256
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,232
Vote for Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

257
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,738
I'm running for condo president.
Like your vote.

258
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,399
Thanks.

259
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,641
Remember, ma'am, a vote for me
is a vote for Kramer.

260
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,047
- Can you cut my meat?
- Gladly.

261
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,007
- Coffee?
- Sure.

262
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,239
Are you black?

263
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,114
Or should I bring some cream?

264
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,256
I'm black. Oh, you know what?
Bring a little cream.

265
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,984
- Look at that.
- Did you hear that?

266
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,923
- What?
- God, there are still people...

267
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,826
...who have trouble
with an interracial couple.

268
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,626
Interracial? Us?

269
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,335
Isn't that unbelievable?

270
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,871
Yes. It's awful.

271
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:46,000
They're upset because
we're an interracial couple.

272
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,770
That is racism.

273
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,781
- I don't feel like eating.
- Me neither.

274
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,578
Well, maybe this turkey club.

275
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,682
So here I am.

276
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,620
Ready to take you to the Hamptons.

277
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,784
Sounds grand.

278
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,327
Do you have your bathing suits?

279
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,656
It's March.

280
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,393
Speak now or we are headed
to the Hamptons.

281
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,569
It's a two-hour drive.

282
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,508
Once you get in that car
we are going all the way...

283
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,911
...to the Hamptons.

284
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,812
All right, you wanna get nuts...

285
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,822
...come on, let's get nuts!

286
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,493
Dad, you know, you can
program this thing to beep...

287
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,222
...every time you need a vitamin.

288
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,363
Dad, you look so different.

289
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,067
We're campaigning, Jerry.

290
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,073
To rule the people,
one must walk among them.

291
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,643
This is the homestretch.
Tomorrow's the election.

292
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,440
Right, yeah. The poll's close
after dinner. Three o'clock.

293
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,082
But then when we win...

294
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,153
...the celebration goes all night
until the break of 8 p.m.

295
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,420
You could put that whole
schedule right in your daily planner.

296
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,255
<i>- Daily what?
- Have you read today's Boca Breeze?</i>

297
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,756
Hey, look at that.
Picture of me, huh?

298
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:18,233
Yeah, "Candidate Cosmo Kramer,
caught barefoot in clubhouse."

299
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,100
Barefoot in the clubhouse?
Kramer...

300
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,366
...don't you realize
this is against the rules?

301
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,477
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.

302
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,046
These people work and wait
their whole lives to move down here...

303
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,515
...sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot,
and enforce these rules.

304
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,551
- Who wants hot chocolate?
- Oh, yeah.

305
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,723
This is a huge scandal.
We need damage control.

306
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,589
All right, look, people seem
to like those tip calculators.

307
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,593
- Wizards.
- How about if we give one out...

308
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,062
...to every member
on the condo board?

309
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,666
Kramer.

310
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,427
There are 20 people on the board.

311
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,798
Thank God you can get that deal.

312
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,567
Payoffs. Now we're playing politics.

313
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,109
All right, what do we do next,
Morty, huh? Wiretaps? Slush funds?

314
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,405
First I need a nap.

315
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,008
I'll get your electric blanket.

316
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,012
Kramer, I can't get
that many Wizards.

317
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,281
- What about your deal?
- I didn't have a deal.

318
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,254
They're $200 a pop. What do I do?

319
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,756
Don't worry. I know a guy.

320
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,521
- Down here?
- Yeah. Bob Saccamano's father.

321
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,794
And that leads
into the master bedroom.

322
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,435
Tell us more.

323
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,503
Wanna hear more?

324
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,873
The master bedroom
opens into the solarium.

325
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,738
- Another solarium?
- Yes, two solariums.

326
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,538
Quite a find.

327
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,712
- And I have horses too.
- What are their names?

328
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,954
Snoopy and Prickly Pete.

329
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,759
Should I keep driving?

330
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,225
Oh, look, an antique stand.

331
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,263
Pull over. We'll buy you
a housewarming gift.

332
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,828
A housewarming gift.

333
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,967
All right, we're taking it up a notch.

334
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,371
- Long day?
- Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.

335
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,240
I hear you, sister.

336
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,210
- Sister?
- Yeah.

337
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,181
It's okay. My boyfriend's black.
Here he is. See?

338
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,287
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

339
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,423
- He's black?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,416
- I'm black?
- Aren't you?

341
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,324
I'll give you a couple
of minutes to decide.

342
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,067
- What are you talking about?
- You're black.

343
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,997
You said we were
an interracial couple.

344
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,502
We are because you're Hispanic.

345
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,500
- I am?
- Aren't you?

346
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,509
No. Why would you think that?

347
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,978
Your name's Benes. Your hair.

348
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,413
You kept taking me
to those Spanish restaurants.

349
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,120
That's because I thought
you were black.

350
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,715
Why would you take me to a Spanish
restaurant because I'm black?

351
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,888
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

352
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,189
- So, what are you?
- I'm white.

353
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,925
So we're just a couple
of white people?

354
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,861
I guess.

355
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,565
Yeah.

356
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,810
- So do you want to go to the Gap?
- Sure.

357
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,980
Well, I handed out all the Wizards.

358
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,280
The polls close in one hour.

359
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,016
I think we've got this baby
all sewn up, huh? Yeah.

360
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,228
Yeah, there was an extra one.
Norman Bergerman.

361
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,297
He won't be leaving any tips
where he is.

362
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,058
Congratulations, Mr. President.

363
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,204
Congratulations,
Mr. Puppet Master, huh?

364
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,602
Hey, Morty, what's wrong
with these tip calculators?

365
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,071
What are you talking about?

366
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,508
It's overtipping.
I just left 5 bucks for a BLT.

367
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,738
Let me see that.

368
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,109
This isn't a Wizard. It's a Willard.

369
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,276
It's a Willard?
Saccamano Sr. screwed me.

370
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,979
Mine doesn't have a seven.

371
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,350
I'm ruined.

372
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,617
Jerry, why didn't you get
them Wizards?

373
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,590
Because the real Wizard's $200.

374
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,822
- You didn't have a deal?
- No deal. Not hot.

375
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,526
Morty, you and Kramer.
You're finished.

376
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,535
Everyone vote for the guy
in the wheelchair.

377
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,572
- Let's go.
- The people have spoken.

378
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,205
Well, that's it for me.
I'm heading back to New York.

379
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,810
Dad, I'm sorry.

380
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,007
You should be.

381
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,813
How could you spend $200
on a tip calculator?

382
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,014
It does other things!

383
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,996
- Where are we, George?
- Almost there.

384
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,740
This is the end of Long Island.

385
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,001
Where's your house?

386
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,342
We go on foot from here.

387
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,210
All right.

388
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,958
There's no house! It's a lie!

389
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,965
There's no solarium.
There's no Prickly Pete.

390
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,069
There's no other solarium.

391
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,568
We know.

392
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:28,410
Then why? Why did you make me
drive all the way out here?

393
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,041
Why didn't you say something?
Why? Why? Why?

394
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,245
We don't like you, George.

395
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,254
And we always blamed you
for what happened to Susan.

396
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,532
All right.

397
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,825
Let's head back.
