1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,333
What is Holland?

2
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,880
What do you mean, what is it?
It's a country right next to Belgium.

3
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,242
No, that's the Netherlands.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,281
Holland is the Netherlands.

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,549
Then who are the Dutch?

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,584
You know,
I cannot stand this thing anymore.

7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,651
I know, I hate it too.
I feel like an out-of-work porn star.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,296
We should have taken
some kind of vacation.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,024
- Well, why didn't we?
- You said this would be better.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,224
Remember?

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,767
"A vacation from ourselves."

12
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,733
That's what you said.

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,039
What if we grew mutton chops?

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,674
- No.
- Buzz cuts?

15
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,037
- Parachute pants?
- Stop it, George. Stop it.

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,235
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,040
You've gotta get a job.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,439
Damn it.

19
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,249
Hey, hey, hey.

20
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,859
Check me out.

21
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,790
No more crutches.
That must be a relief.

22
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,294
Yeah. With crutches,
everyone has questions.

23
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,990
- Not with a cane?
- No, with crutches, it's a funny story.

24
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,399
With a cane, it's a sad story.
You through with those?

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,066
That is a sad story.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
You should've been here.
Some guy from NBC saw my set...

27
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,409
...he wants me to do a showcase.

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,239
I might have another shot at a pilot.

29
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,246
All right. We're back in.

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,111
We? No.

31
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,185
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kenny Bania.

32
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,753
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,857
Hey, Jerry, did you see me
up there?

34
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,459
I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.

35
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,652
- Killed?
- Killed.

36
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,222
I'm gonna go pick up some chicks.

37
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,158
Good-looking ones too.

38
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,766
Hey, what's your name?

39
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,034
Yeah, he killed.

40
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,697
Because I killed first
and warmed up the crowd.

41
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,366
He's like that fish
that attaches himself to the shark.

42
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,512
- And you're the shark?
- Yeah. I'm the shark.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,274
And he's the fish eating my laughs.

44
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,644
I don't know how a fish
could eat laughs.

45
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,683
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.

46
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,028
You got any shredded coconut?

47
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,857
We're not doing that anymore.

48
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,667
- Oh, my God.
- What?

49
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,304
I got a job interview.

50
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,337
They wanna see me this afternoon.

51
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,306
- So, what's this job?
- Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.

52
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,071
- Knicks? Rangers?
- Playground equipment.

53
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,509
Welcome back to the show.

54
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,520
- Yeah, this is better.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,349
- So you got any shredded coconut?
- No.

56
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,185
I gotta hobble.

57
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,026
I gotta switch shaving creams.
I'm getting no protection.

58
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,263
- What kind do you use?
- Whatever you get.

59
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,403
Look. Post card from Elaine
from Europe.

60
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,539
Don't tell me she's dragging
another poor guy across Europe.

61
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,771
Remember David Puddy?

62
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,611
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic.
So she's dating him again, huh?

63
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,312
Well, I guess she's batted around
and she's back at the top of the order.

64
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,086
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine.

65
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,057
That guy's coming home
in a body bag.

66
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,302
Well, let's see, I've got a 10 kroner,
a 5 kroner...

67
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,370
...a 20 kroner. No, wait.

68
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,934
That's another 10 kroner.

69
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,103
<i>Femti kroner.</i>

70
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,438
How much is that?

71
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,203
We have to break up.

72
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,713
- What?
- I can't take this anymore.

73
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,945
I don't wanna hear how interesting
the change with the hole in it is.

74
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,656
And tell me what time it is in New York,
you are going home in a body bag.

75
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,557
Well, what do you think the Gap
in Rome has that's not on Broadway?

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,788
Okay, all right, listen.

77
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,956
Forget about the Gap
because we are through.

78
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,395
- Fine.
- Fine.

79
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,059
Okay, Terminal 3. Have a nice flight.

80
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our flight time with stopovers...</i>

81
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,242
<i>...will be approximately 22 hours.</i>

82
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:11,249
Hey. You gonna bust out
that drink cart or what?

83
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,983
Hey, what are you doing?

84
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,352
Taking this lace out. It came undone,
touched the floor of a men's room.

85
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,686
That's the end of that.

86
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,157
Did you see Bania's set last night?

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,025
I read on the Internet he killed.

88
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,322
He killed.

89
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,560
He only does well
when he has me for a lead-in.

90
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,136
He's a time-slot hit.

91
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,001
Jerry, you gotta give him
some credit.

92
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,472
I mean, you're just being
totally ridiculous.

93
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,775
I'll see you later, buddy.

94
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,013
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.
- What? What? What?

95
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,654
Do I have to ask?

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,382
Well, I ran out of butter,
so I had to borrow yours.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,495
Anything else, Mr. Nosy?

98
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,363
Why are you buttering your face?

99
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,026
I'm shaving with it.

100
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,468
Oh, Moses, smell the roses.

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,167
Look, Jerry, it's vastly superior
to any commercial shaving cream.

102
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,039
I mean, the shave
is close and clean...

103
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,477
...and the natural emollients
keep my skin silky smooth.

104
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,638
- Feel my face.
- No.

105
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,751
- No, feel it.
- I don't want to.

106
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,251
Feel it.

107
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,548
That is close.

108
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,358
I got the job?

109
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,592
George, everybody here at Play Now
is just very impressed with you...

110
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,736
...but I'm sure you've heard
that before.

111
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,661
Well...

112
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,173
...no.

113
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,742
Don't think anyone's
gonna treat you differently...

114
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,845
...just because of your...

115
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,241
Handicap.

116
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,042
Handicap?
Oh, I'm not handicapped.

117
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,206
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,778
Differently...

119
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,513
Advantaged.

120
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,917
See, I didn't mean that.

121
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,425
Of course, you will have your own
private, fully-equipped bathroom.

122
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,762
When do I start?

123
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,199
Well, whenever you feel
that you're able.

124
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,239
You need a hand here?

125
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,337
Yeah, what the hell.

126
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,781
- You got the job?
- Jerry, it's fantastic.

127
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,780
I love the people.
They treat me so great.

128
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,282
They think I'm handicapped.

129
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,886
They gave me this incredible office,
a great view.

130
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,387
- They think you're handicapped?
- Yeah, yeah.

131
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,717
Yeah, because of the cane.

132
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,292
You should see the bathroom
they gave me.

133
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,088
How can you do this?

134
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,061
Jerry, let's face it.
I've always been handicapped.

135
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,326
I'm just now getting
the recognition for it.

136
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,069
Name one thing I have that puts me
in a position of advantage.

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,674
There was a guy that worked
at the Yankees, no arms.

138
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,333
He got more work done than I did.
Made more money.

139
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,412
He had a wife, a family.

140
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,070
Drove a better car than I did.

141
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,809
He drove a car with no arms?

142
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,354
All right, I made up the part
about the car, but the rest is true.

143
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,490
And he hated me anyway.

144
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,115
Do you know how hard it's getting
just to tell people I know you?

145
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,761
I love that bathroom.

146
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,123
It's got that high toilet.

147
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,698
I feel like a gargoyle perched
on the ledge of a building.

148
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,266
Hey. They hooked me up.

149
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,769
What's with all the butter?

150
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,804
I'm shaving with it.
And you know what?

151
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,963
You can eat it?

152
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,532
No.

153
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,611
My face feels so good,
I'm gonna use it all over my body.

154
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,349
Oh, my God. It's Bania and Jenna.

155
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,510
- Who?
- The toothbrush in the toilet bowl.

156
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,255
Hey, Jerry.

157
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,482
This is Jenna.

158
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,183
Pretty good-looking, huh?

159
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,889
Jerry is the guy
that I dated right before you.

160
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,157
This is awkward.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
Don't worry, Kenny.

162
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,031
After dating Jerry,
you're a pleasure.

163
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,698
- I don't believe this.
- You miss her, don't you?

164
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,710
No. He's riding my coattails again.
He's getting everything off of me.

165
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,814
First laughs. Now ladies.

166
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,971
You miss her.

167
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,882
You know, I think, ultimately,
I'm upset with myself.

168
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,892
I knew what I was getting into.
She's a bitter, unstable person.

169
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,960
I mean, the sex was good.

170
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,564
Which I'm sure was fine for her...

171
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,722
...but I need more.

172
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,528
Hey, you believing this?

173
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,899
Excuse me, I was sleeping.

174
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,668
Well, you missed
quite a performance.

175
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,037
That's my apple juice.

176
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,089
Someone's cooking.

177
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,116
Hello, Jerry.

178
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,957
Hello, Newman.

179
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,397
You know, old friend...

180
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,400
...sometimes I ponder this silly
gulf between us...

181
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,697
...and I say, why?

182
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,668
Are we really so different?

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,308
- For what is broth-
- I'm not the one doing the cooking.

184
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,040
Damn you, Seinfeld.

185
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,644
You useless pustule.

186
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,111
Somebody's got something
on the griddle. Maybe it's Kramer.

187
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,517
No, he's up on the roof
getting some sun with the butter.

188
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,325
Oh, no.

189
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,318
Butter?

190
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,324
<i>This is the femti kroner.</i>

191
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,202
You know, my last boyfriend, he had
a real kroner comprehension problem.

192
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,626
You know what I mean?

193
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,898
A real cement head.

194
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,675
- David, you are so funny.
- Yeah, I know.

195
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,701
What are you doing?

196
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,313
It's a long flight.
I had to get on with my life.

197
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,882
By making time with some floozy
across the aisle?

198
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,143
Yeah, that's right.

199
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,287
What's going on over there
with you and...

200
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,786
...Vegetable Lasagna?

201
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,754
This guy? Oh, he's an idiot.
He doesn't mean anything to me.

202
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,791
I can hear you.

203
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,687
She doesn't either. If it were up to me,
we'd still be together.

204
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,730
- Well, maybe I feel the same way.
- Okay.

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,130
- Okay. So now what?
- Let's make out.

206
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,329
- Kramer.
- What?

207
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,539
Oh, man.

208
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,377
I think I cooked myself.

209
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,910
Look at your skin.

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,413
Oh, stick a fork in me, Jerry.

211
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,551
I'm done.

212
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,364
I'm fried.

213
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,933
Technically, you're sautéed.
So, what are you doing for that?

214
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,696
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist
so I don't dry out.

215
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,571
<i>- Is that what the doctor said?
- No, I read an article in Bon Appétit.</i>

216
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,142
- See you.
- See you.

217
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,040
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey, buddy.

218
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,607
- Game hen?
- Kind of.

219
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,245
Nice limp. You bringing
your work home with you?

220
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,355
No, I fake limp on my right.

221
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,253
This is a real limp
because I sprained my ankle.

222
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,586
What happened?

223
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,059
Well, I was buttering myself up
for a nice shave.

224
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,130
Oh, not you too.

225
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,961
I must have dripped some on the floor
and I slipped and-

226
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,569
You know what's good for that?
Relish.

227
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,097
Hello?

228
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,903
Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

229
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,238
What?

230
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,470
No.

231
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,636
No.

232
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,079
No, no, no!

233
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,239
Thank you.

234
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,341
I don't believe this.

235
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,887
They've added Bania to the showcase
and he's going on right after me.

236
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,389
Well, so what?
He's got a couple of good jokes.

237
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,289
Oh, like what? Ovaltine?

238
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,896
Why do dogs drink out of the toilet?

239
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,555
Shopping carts with one bad wheel?

240
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,827
That's true.
That always happens to me.

241
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,768
You think that's funny?

242
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,772
I don't know. I like stuff you don't have
to think about much.

243
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,307
You like Bania's act.

244
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,104
You're a closet Bania fan.

245
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,940
- Maybe I am.
- Oh, I'm gonna puke.

246
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,913
Puke? That's a funny word. Puke.

247
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,851
Puke.

248
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,613
You don't have to think about that.

249
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,626
I can't believe we broke up like that.

250
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,059
It was stupid.

251
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,705
- You want something to read?
- No, I'm good.

252
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,311
- Well, are you gonna take a nap or...?
- No.

253
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,114
You're just gonna sit there
staring at the back of the seat?

254
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,987
Yeah.

255
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,838
That's it. I cannot take this.

256
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,908
I mean, look at this.
Nothing has changed.

257
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,509
We've been together two hours...

258
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,169
...we're having the same problems
we had 12 hours ago.

259
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,009
Oh, tell me about it.
I don't know why I ever took you back.

260
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,118
Oh, please. I took you back.

261
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,949
You know it. I know it.
Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.

262
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,523
Please, please.
I don't want to get involved.

263
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,926
I hope a giant mountain rises out of
the ocean and we ram right into it...

264
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,529
...and end this whole thing.

265
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,325
Oh, God.

266
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,405
How much longer you gonna be?
I'm starving here.

267
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,276
Just a few more squirts...

268
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,440
...because I gotta stay juicy.

269
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,711
That smell.

270
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,685
- It's still with you, huh?
- Oh, yeah, it's baked on in.

271
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,222
Put another stick of butter in.

272
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,120
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Would you?

273
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,660
Yeah. Stir it up so it'll melt.

274
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,230
Oh, yeah.

275
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,691
That feels good.

276
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,235
Yeah, now I'm simmering.

277
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,443
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

278
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,479
- Good morning, George.
- Good morning, sir.

279
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,674
Is there something wrong
with your other leg?

280
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,376
What? No, no.
Just the old handicap acting up.

281
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,455
But your cane's on the wrong side.

282
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,182
Oh, well. That's -

283
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,327
That's just because we're standing
on opposite sides.

284
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,029
Yeah, see, when we met...

285
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,428
...I was over there
and you were over here...

286
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,003
...so the image was reversed.
Like in a mirror. You see?

287
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,436
See, this looks right to you,
doesn't it?

288
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,204
Yeah, I guess.

289
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,175
But, see, here.

290
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,711
Right.

291
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,075
Wrong.

292
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,648
Right.

293
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,375
Wrong. Right.

294
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,511
- Right. Wrong.
- Will you stop it, George? Just stop it.

295
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,659
I think I can see
what's going on here.

296
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,932
Well, you're not gonna believe
what happened.

297
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,603
You mugged Steven Hawking?

298
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,950
Play Now thinks
I got problems in both legs.

299
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,484
My own personal Rascal, Jerry.

300
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,485
On the house.

301
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,617
It must comforting to know
you'll be going to hell...

302
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,627
...at no more
than three miles an hour.

303
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,359
- Hello?
- Jerry.

304
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,196
Hey, Laney. How's the trip going?

305
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,359
<i>Oh, it's awful.</i>

306
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,899
This trip was a huge mistake.

307
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,064
Huge.

308
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,871
- Please stop shouting. I can't take it.
- Who's that?

309
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,241
<i>- It's Vegetable Lasagna.
- Who?</i>

310
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,383
Vegetable Lasagna.

311
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,916
My name is Magnus.

312
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,021
<i>Shut up or I'll snap you in half
and stuff you in the overhead.</i>

313
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,056
Get me some duty-free Kahlúa.

314
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,983
- How was the trip?
- Sounded good.

315
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,992
Well, gotta motor.

316
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,223
If you got juice left, you might
wanna roll by the showcase tonight.

317
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,825
You're still going on in front
of Bania, huh?

318
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,370
That's right. And I'll tell you what,
I'm feeling a little off.

319
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,836
What are you talking about?

320
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,373
- You're not.
- That's right.

321
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,704
I'm taking a dive.

322
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,870
- You're throwing the set?
- I'm laying down.

323
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,644
Then we'll see how he does, up there,
without all the assistance.

324
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,746
Listen, Jerry, with all due respect...

325
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,652
...Bania's voice is the voice
of a new generation.

326
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,053
My generation.

327
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,025
- We're four months apart.
- Nevertheless.

328
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,228
His time has come.

329
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,865
Now, if you will kindly help me
unwedge my front wheel...

330
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,198
...I'll be on my way.

331
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,576
Butter.

332
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,182
Kramer.

333
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,381
Butter. Kramer.

334
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,854
Hey, buddy.

335
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,735
Jerry, what are you doing?

336
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,430
George tells me
you're gonna throw your set?

337
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,938
That's right, Choochie.

338
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,441
Let's see how Bania
does without the cushy time slot.

339
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jerry Seinfeld.

340
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,646
You'll excuse me.

341
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,716
Whoa, man.

342
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:12,014
Hey, everybody,
who's ready to laugh?

343
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,693
And what's the deal
with lamp shades?

344
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,454
I mean, if it's a lamp...

345
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,120
...why do you want shade?

346
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,968
And what's with people getting sick?

347
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,775
I mean, what's the deal with cancer?

349
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,376
I have cancer.

350
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,675
Tough crowd.

351
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,809
Hey. Hey.

352
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,280
You dented my ride.

353
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,520
What you got there, the four volt?

354
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,985
I did you a favor.

355
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,824
How about I do you a favor
upside your head?

356
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,128
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

357
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,970
Hey.

358
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,542
Get the bikes.

359
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,444
Ouch.

360
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,244
Well, that wasn't so bad.

361
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,414
What are you talking about?
I bombed.

362
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,384
No, you had some good stuff.

363
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,046
The cancer bit.

364
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,151
It was edgy. It was not my thing.

365
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,192
But some of those people,
they liked it.

366
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,196
- Like who?
- Well, that guy who yelled out.

367
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,833
He had cancer.

368
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,526
And laughter is the best medicine.

369
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,033
Hey, sorry, Kenny.

370
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,935
Guess you got your work
cut out for you.

371
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,576
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kenny Bania.

372
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,535
Where were you?

373
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,374
Jerry, he could have used your laugh.

374
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,278
He was a big turkey up there.

375
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,542
Turkey?

376
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,913
A big, fat turkey.

377
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,554
I'm sorry I missed that.

378
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,482
I'll tell you, he worked so hard
and then he just blows-

379
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,895
What is this? Oregano?

380
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,390
Look at me.

381
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,833
I'm all covered
in oregano and parmesan...

382
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,097
...and it's sticking
because of the butter.

383
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,235
Look at me.

384
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,072
Hold this.

385
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,310
What is this? Parsley?

386
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,313
The sweet stench of failure.

387
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,718
He bit me. Get off of me.

388
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,624
Get off me.

389
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,533
Come on.

390
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,499
That stupid two-hour battery.

391
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,242
Now I've got you.

392
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,843
George?

393
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,684
Your legs.

394
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,950
Are you a religious man, sir?

395
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,321
No.

396
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,189
- Eat hickory.
- No.

397
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,633
Hey, Jerry. Did you see it?

398
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,602
Ouch.

399
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,342
Kenny, there you are.

400
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,445
Jay Chermack
and Stu Crespi from NBC.

401
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,014
- Listen, Kenny, really funny out there.
- What?

402
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,413
That thing you did,
the two guys running through?

403
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,645
I love stuff
you don't have to think about.

404
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,645
Give us a call.

405
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,553
We wanna be
in the Kenny Bania business.

406
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,853
By the way, Jerry,
the suspenders...

407
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,462
...a little hackey.

408
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,925
How about that, Jerry?

409
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,625
First you had a pilot on NBC
and now I'll have one.

410
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,566
Looks like I'm following you again.

411
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,330
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

412
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,475
Puke? That's a funny word.

413
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,704
Can I use that?

414
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,881
This has been the worst month
of my life...

415
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,288
...and if I never see you again
it'll be too soon.

416
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,449
Ditto.

417
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,290
- Oh, that's original.
- Go to hell.

418
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,334
86th and Broadway, please.

419
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,804
I'm sorry, lady,
there's a cab shortage.

420
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,531
The transit police
are making everyone share.

421
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,574
Oh, no.

422
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,445
Hello.

423
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,706
Oh, no.

424
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,611
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,081
Oh, no.

426
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,452
No!
