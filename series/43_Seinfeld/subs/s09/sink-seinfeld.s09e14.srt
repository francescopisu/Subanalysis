1
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,702
Maura, I want you to know,
I've given this a lot of thought.

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,504
I'm sorry, but we have to break up.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,678
No.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,185
- What's that?
- We're not breaking up.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,916
We're not?

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,053
No.

7
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,956
All right.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,772
- She said no?
- She said no.

9
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,102
What did you do?

10
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,206
What could I do?

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,904
We fooled around
and went to a movie.

12
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,608
George, both parties don't have
to consent to a breakup.

13
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,449
It's not like you're launching missiles
and you both have to turn your keys.

14
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,124
You didn't make a convincing case.
Let me hear your arguments.

15
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,592
- Well, I don't really like her.
- That's good.

16
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,924
- I don't find her attractive.
- Solid.

17
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,761
- I'd like to sleep with other women.
- Always popular.

18
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,836
Sometimes at restaurants
she talks to her food.

19
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,803
"Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes,
you are so good."

20
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,502
You have an airtight case.

21
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,304
- And in bed-
- I'm afraid we're out of time.

22
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,770
- Hey.
- What?

23
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,747
Check these out.
These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks...

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,784
<i>...that he wore
in the movie Cinderfella.</i>

25
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,148
I got them at an auction.

26
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,756
I got some cufflinks
I could have loaned you.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,723
Jerry Lewis is gonna be
at this Friars Club roast I'm going to.

28
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,953
Now I have an in to strike up
a conversation.

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,325
You already have an in.

30
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,400
You have the same first name.

31
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,801
Jerry.

32
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,105
Oh, that'll intrigue him.

33
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,410
Well, it worked when I met
George Peppard last week.

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,771
George Peppard
has been dead for years.

35
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,212
<i>Well, whoever he was,
he knew a lot about The A-Team.</i>

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,080
So you would choose your last meal
based on the method of execution?

37
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,088
Right, if I was getting the chair...

38
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,489
...I'd go for something hot and spicy,
you know?

39
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,630
Thai, maybe Mexican.

40
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,666
Lethal injection, feels like pasta.

41
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,826
You know, it's painless,
I don't want anything too heavy.

42
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,472
So why don't we
get together some time?

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,733
Oh, sure. Why don't you give me
your number?

44
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,809
I think it'd be better if I called you.

45
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,970
Oh, okay. Maybe we could grab
some lunch sometime.

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,208
- Do you work around here or...?
- No, not really.

47
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,513
So is there anything
you can tell me about yourself?

48
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,512
I think you're very beautiful.

49
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,291
That'll do.

50
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,718
What about Puddy?

51
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,262
I haven't talked to him
in like three weeks.

52
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,194
I think it might be over.

53
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,066
- So, what's this guy about?
- I don't know.

54
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,696
He wouldn't tell me his phone number,
where he worked.

55
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,706
I'll bet he's in a relationship.

56
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,847
Or he's a crime fighter
safeguarding his secret identity.

57
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,941
Elaine, you could be dating
the Green Lantern.

58
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,746
- Which one is he?
- Green suit, power ring.

59
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,015
I don't care for jewelry on men.

60
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,789
Hey, it happened again.

61
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,622
Another robbery in the building.

62
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,821
So you bought a cooler?

63
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,762
No, it's a strongbox
to protect my irreplaceables.

64
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,200
And what would those be?

65
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,772
Some taxidermy that's been
in my family for generations.

66
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,105
My Tony, my military discharge.

67
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,575
You were in the Army?

68
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,137
Briefly.

69
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,109
Now, I gotta find a good place
to hide this key...

70
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,880
...because if somebody finds this, they
hold the key to all my possessions.

71
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,889
- Literally.
- Literally?

72
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,118
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,991
- You mind if I hide this somewhere?
- No, go ahead.

74
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,131
- A little privacy, huh?
- Oh, come on.

75
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,967
Come on, this is a security issue.

76
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,369
You wouldn't last
a day in the Army.

77
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,640
- How long did you last?
- Well, that's classified.

78
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,909
Hey, what if he's married?

79
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,145
- Kramer?
- No, the Green Lantern.

80
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,612
Okay.

81
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,019
So you would date a married guy?

82
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,660
That's so hacky.

83
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,819
Well, I don't know. I may never marry.

84
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,795
This might be the closest I get.

85
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,592
You peeked.

86
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,171
This is your hiding place?

87
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,305
It was under a spoon.

88
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:45,113
And so, for all these reasons,
we are officially broken up.

89
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,347
Thank you and good night.

90
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,355
No, George, we're not.

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,356
But I proved it.

92
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,494
I refuse to give up
on this relationship.

93
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,460
It's like launching missiles
from a submarine.

94
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,565
Both of us have to turn our keys.

95
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,470
Well, then I am gonna have
to ask you to turn your key.

96
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,736
I'm sorry, George. I can't do that.

97
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,305
Turn your key, Maura.
Turn your key.

98
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,080
So how is a guy like you
not involved?

99
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,049
I might ask you the same thing.

100
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,012
<i>That's true.
Maybe he's not married.</i>

101
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,325
Oh, that is so sweet.

102
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,859
<i>How long do I have to hold this?</i>

103
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,893
- Oh, no.
- Who is it?

104
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,831
No one. No one.

105
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,702
Here, let me show you a shortcut.
Come on.

106
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,934
<i>Married. That's it,
I'm chucking the flower.</i>

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,078
Jerry. Jerry!

108
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,275
Elaine, what are you doing
down there?

109
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,284
You didn't hear me buzzing?

110
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,749
Oh, I guess it's broken.

111
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,914
Throw down your key.

112
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,561
It's liable to bounce
and go into a sewer.

113
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,094
I'll catch it.

114
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,629
You'll chicken out
at the last second.

115
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,063
Yeah, you're right.

116
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,765
Well, will you at least keep me
company until somebody comes out?

117
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,399
All right.

118
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,576
Hey, you know what's weird?

119
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,912
I used to be able to have
a huge meal and go right to sleep.

120
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,780
I can't anymore.

121
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,444
Nodding off!

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,790
Well, I was right. He's an adulterer.

123
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,089
And he's cheating on his wife
with me.

124
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,498
We haven't done anything yet.

125
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:47,104
I'm hungry.
Can you throw something down?

126
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:51,869
All right. Here.
I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.

127
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,913
It went in the sewer.

128
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,814
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

129
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,691
You jammed your key in here.
You shorted out my intercom.

130
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,160
You just had to go looking for it,
didn't you?

131
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,322
See, you hate it that I have
a little secret.

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,061
Anything I do,
you gotta know all about it.

133
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,205
You're so obsessed with me.

134
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,438
I'm gonna go let Elaine in.

135
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,200
What are you doing with her?

136
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,008
- Kramer.
- Security issue.

137
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,542
- Oh, hey, you got in.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,620
- Flirted with the menu guy. Here.
- Oh, thanks.

139
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,280
That wasn't me.

140
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,183
So he's definitely married, huh?

141
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,331
Boy, I would loved to have been there
when you told him off.

142
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,028
Oh, come on.

143
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,536
Well, he could be a superhero.
You should have seen him run.

144
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,834
Okay.

145
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,106
All right, Jerry. Let's see
if you can get it in your head...

146
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,909
...that this is not an Easter egg hunt
for your childish amusement.

147
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,711
Jerry.

148
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,250
George, the buzzer's broken.
I'll come down.

149
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,724
I believe this belongs to you.

150
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,574
Where did you get that?

151
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,039
I bought it.

152
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,520
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

153
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,552
- I don't know you.
- What?

154
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,420
There's have been some robberies
in the building. I can't let you in.

155
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,256
But I live here. I ran out to buy some
bird seed and I forgot my key.

156
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,591
Sounds like a scam.

157
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,767
I'm very sorry.

158
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,634
So I broke up with Maura.
It's done. I'm out.

159
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,605
Great.
You're lonely and miserable again.

160
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,142
It feels right.

161
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,274
Is that guy still there?

162
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,747
- He's staring at us.
- Don't look at him.

163
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,615
We don't hear that.

164
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,058
- Want a bite?
- No, I don't.

165
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,561
<i>That ginger ale at the coffee shop is
just Coke and Sprite mixed together.</i>

166
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,327
<i>How can I prove it?</i>

167
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,200
<i>Damn it, I can't. Damn it.</i>

168
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,375
Hi, honey.

169
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,783
What? Maura,
what are you doing here?

170
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,751
I ended this relationship twice.

171
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,982
George, you didn't mean that.
That was just a fight.

172
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,955
Why does it always seem like I'm
the only one working at this breakup?

173
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,156
George, I listened
to your arguments...

174
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,531
...and they were rambling and flimsy.
I'm not convinced.

175
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,929
Come on, get dressed
and let's get some dinner.

176
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,437
All right.

177
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,546
Mr. Apple, you have a brown spot.

178
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,023
So this is your little love nest?

179
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,359
It's nothing special,
just a little place I keep.

180
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,356
Should I light a fire?

181
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,000
That sounds romantic.

182
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,999
I'm having a little problem
with the heat.

183
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,502
I got some cardboard out here.

184
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,641
<i>This is wrong. I should go.</i>

185
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,512
- Can you get that, please?
- Oh, sure.

186
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,478
Where's Glenn?

187
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,622
You're the woman from the street,
and I am so sorry.

188
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,815
You know, I'm not really
a homewrecker.

189
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,393
I thought he was a superhero.
I swear.

190
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,725
Lady, I'm not his wife.
I'm his welfare caseworker.

191
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,366
Is he home?

192
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,230
- This is his home?
- Yes.

193
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,739
- So he's...
- Poor.

194
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,369
I think this will burn.

195
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,853
- So you do live here.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,137
- You live on this floor?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,138
- So you live right there.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,605
So I guess I'll-

199
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,762
He wouldn't give me his number,
because he doesn't have a phone.

200
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,299
He's not married. He's poor.

201
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,498
Is he wretchedly poor?

202
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,071
Does he wear one of those barrels
with the straps?

203
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,511
He probably busted it up
and burned it for heat.

204
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,482
So when are you giving Boxcar Willie
his walking papers?

205
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,484
How can I end it over money?
I feel bad.

206
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,951
Well, let's think.

207
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,455
Have you dealt with the poor
in any other situation?

208
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,456
Yes. There was this homeless guy...

209
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,959
...who used to urinate
on our garbage cans.

210
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,995
Good. How did you handle that?

211
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,292
We gave him a few bucks.

212
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,162
He goes in the alley
across the street.

213
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,930
Same situation.
Pay him off and you're clean.

214
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,940
Well, I am not paying Glenn off
to get out of this relationship.

215
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,304
What am I supposed to do?

216
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,743
Just walk into his hovel
and hand him-

217
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,349
Well, how much do you think
it would be?

218
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,350
- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

219
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,148
Seeing Maura.

220
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:14,486
Apparently, I was unable to break up
beyond a reasonable doubt.

221
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,725
If only he could have been
cheating on his wife.

222
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,024
You know, things would have been
so much simpler.

223
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,667
- Who's this? Blue Arrow?
- Green Lantern.

224
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,168
We found out his superpower
was lack of money.

225
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,796
- All right.
- He's invulnerable to creditors.

226
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,705
- We get it.
- He's the Got-No-Green Lantern.

227
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,440
Thank you.

228
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,208
Hey, Elaine.
Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.

229
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,876
Well crafted.

230
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,786
Hey, maybe this cheating thing
is what I could use to ditch Maura.

231
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,519
- Tell Maura you're having an affair.
- She's like a district attorney.

232
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,687
If it's not the truth,
I'll break under the cross.

233
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,197
I actually have to do it.

234
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,428
Could you move over there?

235
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,842
Hey, there's this secretary at work
that always had a crush on me.

236
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,775
How come you never
pursued her before?

237
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,848
She's too tan.

238
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,917
It's the middle of the winter,
she's like a carrot.

239
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,088
- Did I leave my glasses?
- He can wipe out his account...

240
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,554
- ...in a single bounce.
- Keep them.

241
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,468
There's a giant parrot
in the hallway.

242
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,035
- It's Phil's.
- Who?

243
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,536
Our neighbor
that you turned against.

244
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,599
I told him it would be fine...

245
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,370
...if he wanted to let it stretch its wings
in the hallway.

246
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,036
What did you tell him that for?

247
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,512
Since you've been playing
God with the front door...

248
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,117
...I've been trying
to smooth things out, Jerry.

249
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,278
- I was just hanging out at his place.
- Really? What's it like?

250
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,549
Is it nicer?
Where does he have the couch?

251
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,057
Well, I don't know,
but the key problem is solved.

252
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,888
- I hid it at Phil's.
- He let you?

253
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,498
No, he doesn't know.
See, I hid it without telling him.

254
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,262
So Phil won't be compulsively
looking for it like some people.

255
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,305
You.

256
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,949
So you say you've been
in the city all winter?

257
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,286
I was in Maine for a couple days.

258
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,320
Well...

259
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,260
...here we are.

260
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,596
George, I've always fantasized about
jumping into bed with you.

261
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:45,869
But I don't wanna spoil things
by sleeping with you too soon.

262
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,537
Are you sure? Because it could
really help me out of a jam.

263
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,608
I wanna build something with you,
George.

264
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,548
Oh, not more building.

265
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,685
And I won't take no for an answer.

266
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,450
- No?
- No.

267
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,287
All right.

268
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,163
What are we doing
in this alley, anyway?

269
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,565
It's a surprise.

270
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,806
- What are you doing? What is that?
- It's a bag of doughnuts.

271
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,472
- It's garbage.
- No, no.

272
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,548
When they make the new ones,
the old ones come out right here.

273
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,685
All right, that's it.

274
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,514
- How do you spell your last name?
- It's a bear claw.

275
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,883
You have no idea how rare this is.

276
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,048
I'll make it out to cash.

277
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,093
How about 200 bucks? Two-fifty?

278
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,025
Make it 300.

279
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,860
You know, Elaine...

280
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,464
...you're the bear claw
in the garbage bag of my life.

281
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,933
Oh, Glenn.

282
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,019
- Hi, is Phil here?
- Yeah, I'm here.

283
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,386
Phil. Hi.

284
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,582
I know we got off to kind
of a bad start, but your bird...

285
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,129
...which is lovely, by the way,
made a mess on my door.

286
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,553
And?

287
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,565
I thought maybe you'd clean it up
or your maid there.

288
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,033
That's my wife.

289
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,370
All right, I think we're done here.

290
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,207
So you're in a relationship
with a woman you don't like...

291
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,477
...and you're having an affair
with a woman that won't have sex.

292
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,119
This isn't going well.

293
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,854
I cannot find
my Jerry Lewis cufflinks.

294
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,549
Without them, I have no in.

295
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,686
You don't need the cufflinks.
You have the same name.

296
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,496
Jerry.

297
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,999
Where are you going? Help me look.

298
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,004
It's a big night.
I'm ice-skating with one...

299
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:59,338
<i>...and going to a staged reading
of Godspell with the other.</i>

300
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,073
- Which is with who?
- It doesn't matter.

301
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,977
Yeah, you clean up nice.

302
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,179
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.

303
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,017
Yeah. See, I knew you
would lose them.

304
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,753
That's why I took them out of your
drawer and put them in my strongbox.

305
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,590
You're a lifesaver.
Would you get them, please?

306
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,426
We'll stop by Phil's,
pick up the key.

307
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,597
Hey, what's going on?

308
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,833
Fredo is dead.

309
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,999
That strange Portuguese guy
that lives next to the incinerator?

310
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,113
No, my bird. We just got back
from the pet cemetery.

311
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,579
Oh, Phil.

312
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,151
Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.

313
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,880
Oh, I'll bet you are.

314
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,289
They told us he was poisoned.
Something in his food.

315
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,361
But I didn't -

316
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,125
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo.

317
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,561
And who buries a bird?

318
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,759
Yeah, just give it
to the Portuguese guy...

319
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,461
...and he puts it in the incinerator.

320
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,603
Just get the key
and let's get out of here.

321
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,006
You know, it's a funny thing
about that bird dying.

322
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,204
I hid the key in Fredo's food dish.

323
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,045
That's a weird coincidence.

324
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,679
- Kramer.
- What?

325
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,319
You killed Fredo.

326
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,657
Fredo was weak and stupid.
He shouldn't have eaten that key.

327
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,292
Kramer, I need those cufflinks...

328
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,985
...but now they're in the box
and the key is in the bird.

329
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,960
What are we gonna do?

330
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,996
You just answered
your own question.

331
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,827
- Oh, no.
- I'll get the shovel.

332
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:39,339
The actor that played Jesus
made some odd choices.

333
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,368
What?

334
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,672
I mean, I had fun ice-skating.

335
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,757
- George.
- Maura.

336
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,622
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

337
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,194
You told me to meet you here.

338
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,756
I'm caught in my own web of lies.

339
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,870
- I'm Maura.
- I'm Loretta. You wanna join us?

340
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,370
This is all blowing up in my face.

341
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,032
My serious girlfriend
and my torrid love affair...

342
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,906
...have accidentally crossed paths.

343
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,946
I have ruined three lives.

344
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:22,479
Well, I understand if you never wanna
see me again. So-

345
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,179
What we have is too important.
We can work through this.

346
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,587
So can we.

347
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,721
What?

348
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,493
- So this is still not over?
- No.

349
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,966
- You?
- No.

350
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,394
All right.

351
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,712
Elaine, oh, wow. A TV, a stereo.

352
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,146
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood
so you won't have to burn them.

353
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,917
Oh, my God, Alison.
You're home early.

354
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,252
- Who is this?
- His wife.

355
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,756
You're poor and married.

356
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,187
Looks like it.

357
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,594
Who the hell are you?

358
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,294
I guess I'm Lois Loan.

359
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,265
I can't believe we're grave robbers.

360
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,637
"Man's best friend."

361
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,177
Jerry, I want something like that
on my tombstone.

362
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:24,975
Oh, my God, here he is.

363
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,015
I don't wanna dig him up.

364
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,447
All right, then you're the one
getting the key out of him.

365
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,217
I'll dig.

366
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,120
Listen, I heard that Lassie
number three's buried here.

367
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,492
I'm gonna go check it out.

368
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,674
Well, that was easy.

369
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:58,043
All right, honey, one last look, then
you have to let Fredo rest in peace.

370
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,753
Hey, Kramer. I dug Fredo out.
Now let's cut him open.

371
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,356
Oh, my God.

372
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,186
Hey, neighbor.

373
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,098
All right.

374
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,468
I'm gonna try giving them $55 each.

375
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,102
What do you think?

376
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,444
Give me 40.
You'll never see me again.

377
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,519
So, what are you gonna do? Are you
gonna live here, or move out or what?

378
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,017
I'll just take the fire escape
to get in and out of the building.

379
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,398
So, what's in the cooler?

380
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,436
Well, will you look at that.
I guess I forgot to lock it.

381
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,268
You mean, it was open?

382
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,812
We desecrated a pet cemetery
for nothing?

383
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,780
Well, this is one for the books,
huh, Jerry?

384
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,382
<i>Really one for the books.</i>
