1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,700
- Tea with lemon.
- What happened to your voice?

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,567
I was screaming at hecklers
all night.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,232
Last time I open for a rodeo.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,445
Well, Jerry, I've been thinking.

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,071
I've gone as far as I can go
with George Costanza.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,411
Is this the suicide talk,
or the nickname talk?

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,951
The nickname.

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,420
"George. " What is that?
It's nothing.

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,389
It's got no snap. No zip.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,085
I need a nickname
that makes people light up.

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,527
You mean like "Liza."

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,690
I was thinking...

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,358
...T-Bone.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,936
But there's no T in your name.
What about G-Bone?

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,039
- There's no G-Bone.
- There's a G-Spot.

16
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,970
That's a myth.

17
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,941
T-Bone, the ladies
are gonna love you.

18
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,921
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,455
They heard I opened
for Kenny Rogers once.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,520
Didn't he throw you off a bus
in the middle of Alabama?

21
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,425
Oh, I had that coming to me.

22
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,032
You know, Kenny Rogers has-

23
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,202
Why did you get a maid?

24
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,671
You don't have to whisper.
She knows she's a maid.

25
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,973
Where did you get her?

26
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,044
I hired her from a service.

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,709
- All done.
- Thank you. Nice job.

28
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,445
- Is this mine?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,398
- What?
- Come on, Jerry, you didn't notice?

30
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,800
Notice what?
She's not really even a maid.

31
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,963
She wants to be an actress...

32
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,167
...or a model or a dancer...

33
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,812
- ...or a newswoman.
- Newswoman.

34
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,174
Well, bad news, boys.

35
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,081
Yeah, my life is over.
My girlfriend's moving away.

36
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,916
- You have a girlfriend?
- Jerry, where have you been?

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,580
At a rodeo.

38
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,790
- Where's she moving?
- Downtown.

39
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,827
- Downtown New York?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,091
I don't know if I can handle one
of these long-distance relationships.

41
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,632
It's like 10 minutes by subway.

42
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,963
I don't know.

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,737
Well, you got a maid.

44
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,603
Come on, it's a whole different
world downtown.

45
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,610
Different Gap,
different Tower Records.

46
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,840
And she's a 646.

47
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,242
- What? What's that?
- That's the new area code.

48
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,820
They've run out of 212s so all
the new phone numbers are 646.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,653
I was a 718 when I first moved here.
I cried every night.

50
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,219
Listen, heads up, Elaine.

51
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,829
I'm gonna have to stop by later
and pick up a fax.

52
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,863
- At work?
- No, at your apartment.

53
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,327
I don't have a fax machine.

54
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,093
Here we go.

55
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,663
Well, now what are we gonna do?

56
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,001
See, this is why you should get
a fax and a Xerox.

57
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,077
And a deadbolt.

58
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,774
You sure you don't have one?

59
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,347
There's a lot of stuff in my apartment
I've never seen.

60
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,848
Then maybe you have
a fax machine.

61
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,253
You just blew my mind.

62
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,686
Let's order lunch.

63
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,884
Mary, I will have a chef's salad.

64
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,460
Turkey sandwich.

65
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,097
T-bone steak.

66
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:24,066
- For lunch?
- Well, I am just a T-bone kind of guy.

67
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,728
Love that T-bone.

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,041
- In fact, you might as well call me-
- That sounds good.

69
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,769
I'll have one too.

70
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,574
- Watkins, you're having a T-bone?
- I love them.

71
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,216
Well, then we should call you T-Bone.

72
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,512
- No, no, no, we shouldn't.
- T-Bone.

73
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:49,128
<i>T-Bone. T-Bone.
T-Bone. T-Bone. T-Bone.</i>

74
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,001
Hello?

75
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,511
What?

76
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,014
<i>You have 57 messages.</i>

77
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,244
<i>Message one.</i>

78
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,649
<i>Message two.</i>

79
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,587
<i>Message three.</i>

80
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,093
<i>Hey, it's George. Listen, I-</i>

81
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,494
<i>Message four.</i>

82
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,092
Kramer.

83
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,209
Hello?

84
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,488
- Well, Cindy, the place looks great.
- Thanks, Jerry. Gotta run.

85
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,558
Okay, I'll see you.

86
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,429
Hi, Elaine.

87
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,577
All right.

88
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:19,647
Fooling around with your maid.
That is a wise decision.

89
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,486
Elaine, do you think I would go
willy-nilly into a situation...

90
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,490
...so obviously fraught
with potential complications?

91
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,994
You're paying a woman to come
to your house and sleep with you.

92
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,000
No. I pay her to clean.

93
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,296
The rest is-

94
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,472
What? A health plan?

95
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,005
I was going to say,
being a good host.

96
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,108
But the point is, we have
our personal relationship...

97
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,011
...and we have our work
relationship.

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,210
They're separate and I think
somewhat sophisticated.

99
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,754
- So you consider this a relationship?
- Yes, I do.

100
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,493
- Have you been out?
- Yes, we have.

101
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,425
- Where did you go?
- The store.

102
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,588
- To get what?
- Stuff.

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,529
- Cleaning supplies?
- And gum.

104
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,461
Well, there's nothing more
sophisticated...

105
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,573
...than diddling the maid
and then chewing some gum.

106
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,336
She's not a maid.
She might be a newswoman.

107
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,375
Well, I just saw Madeline off.

108
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,280
Yeah, she's in a cab
and on her way.

109
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,183
I miss her already.

110
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,653
Hey, Kramer, what was it
you were having faxed...

111
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,091
...to my house every 30 seconds?

112
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,529
Well, I signed up for a food delivery
service, "Now We're Cooking."

113
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,965
It's a play on words.

114
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,306
You know, they're faxing me
the menus from some restaurants.

115
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,998
- Which ones?
- Well, all of them.

116
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,700
That's the deluxe package.

117
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,279
- So this is never gonna stop?
- Well, it better not.

118
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,972
I paid for the whole year.

119
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,243
- So should I pick those up later?
- You can pick them up right now.

120
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,762
<i>I wonder if anyone knows
he's here.</i>

121
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,397
<i>If he just disappeared...</i>

122
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,001
<i>...would anybody notice?</i>

123
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,797
All right, Miss Benes. All finished.
Here's your new number.

124
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,176
- Six-four-six? What is this?
- That's your new area code.

125
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,541
I thought 646
was just for new numbers.

126
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,773
This is a new number.

127
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,384
No, no, no.
It's not a new number.

128
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,113
It's just a changed number.

129
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,851
See, it's not different,
it's the same, just changed.

130
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,860
Look, I work
for the phone company.

131
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,555
I've had a lot of experience
with semantics.

132
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,293
So don't try to lure me
into some maze of circular logic.

133
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,339
You know, I could have killed you
and no one would have known.

134
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,805
I could have killed you,
and no one would have known.

135
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,205
Kramer, you're still on the phone?

136
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,316
<i>Madeline and I are watching
Quincy together.</i>

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,919
Jerry, you know this comes on
at the same time here...

138
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,611
...as it is does there?

139
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,781
Really? It's Tuesday here.
What day is it there?

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,816
Jerry's teasing.

141
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,325
Oh, oh, commercial.

142
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,964
Oh, you're going to the bathroom?
Yeah, I'll go too.

143
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,622
Madeline stays here.

144
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,934
Hey, T-Bone.

145
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,799
No, no T-Bone.

146
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,104
- No T-Bone?
- Hey, is that T-Bone?

147
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,246
No. There's no T-Bone.

148
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,644
- Why no T-Bone?
- Why no T-Bone?

149
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,479
Because Neil Watkins
from Accounting is T-Bone.

150
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,986
I'm back. Hey, you wanna
play cards over the phone?

151
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,648
All right.

152
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,155
Oh, hey, listen, Jerry.

153
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,662
Laundry's piling up there.
You might wanna tell your girlfriend.

154
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,334
Your girlfriend
is doing your laundry?

155
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,304
He's sleeping with his maid.

156
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,339
- You're sleeping with the maid?
- Yes.

157
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,378
I've done that.

158
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,015
- Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
- No.

159
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,625
You're probably one of those women
who doesn't give out her number.

160
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,421
No, I'm not. Here you go.

161
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,127
- Six-four-six?
- It's a new area code.

162
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,860
What area? New Jersey?

163
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,300
No, no, it's right here in the city.

164
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:37,602
It's the same as 212,
they just multiplied it by three.

165
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,606
And then they added one
to the middle number.

166
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,271
It's the same.

167
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,713
Do I have to dial a " 1 " first?

168
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,351
I'm really kind of seeing somebody.

169
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,583
Yeah? Well, so am I.

170
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,822
Excuse me, can I talk to you
for a second there, Watkins?

171
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,726
It's T-Bone.

172
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:04,096
The thing is,
I'm supposed to be T-Bone.

173
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,904
You're not a T-Bone.
You're a perfect George.

174
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,770
What?
Now, you listen to me.

175
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:16,714
Boy, look at George,
just giving it to T-Bone.

176
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,810
He's jumping up and down
like some kind of monkey.

177
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,921
Hey, what was the name of that-

178
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,583
That monkey that could read
sign language?

179
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,992
All right, you can have T-Bone.
Stop crying.

180
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,997
I'm not crying.

181
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,163
And I shouldn't have said that
about your wife.

182
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,000
Please accept my apologies.

183
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,335
Okay, everybody,
I have an announcement to make.

184
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,574
From now on, I will be known as-

185
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,776
Koko, the monkey.

186
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,059
<i>- What?
- Koko.</i>

187
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,288
<i>Koko. Koko. Koko...</i>

188
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,864
Thank you both for being here.

189
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,602
Excuse me, I live in the building.

190
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,362
Did something happen
to Mrs. Krantz?

191
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,664
She passed.

192
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,535
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

193
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,873
Quick question...

194
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,913
...did she by any chance
have a 212 phone number?

195
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,049
I can't find my earring.

196
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
Oh, here it is.

197
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,880
Listen, can I borrow your suitcases?

198
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,253
- Yeah, it's in your closet.
- No, no, no. I looked.

199
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,759
They're behind my skis
and my tennis racket.

200
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,863
- Thanks, buddy.
- Where you going?

201
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,194
I'm getting out of town. I'm gonna
visit Madeline for the weekend.

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,235
This place is looking kind of messy.
What happened to Cindy?

203
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,237
Oh, she's here.
She's just didn't get around to it.

204
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,537
Hi, Kramer.

205
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,904
Thanks, Jerry. Bye.

206
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,845
Well, what's the matter?

207
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,544
What did I just pay for?

208
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,887
You're a john.

209
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,163
- Koko?
- Koko.

210
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,634
Well, it's probably
the most intelligent ape there is.

211
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,696
Yeah.

212
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,874
So how's Cindy the maid?

213
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,945
Everything's going great,
except basically, I'm paying for sex.

214
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,548
Tell me about it.
I went out with a girl last week.

215
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,581
- First I paid for dinner-
- No, George.

216
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,882
She's coming over and not cleaning.
It's like I'm seeing a prostitute.

217
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,921
- How much you pay this maid?
- Forty.

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,752
Forty? I'm paying 60 to my maid.

219
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,985
She doesn't do laundry
and I'm getting nothing.

220
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,528
- All right.
- Once she pinched my ass...

221
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,427
...but I don't know what that was.

222
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,124
I don't know what this is.

223
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,166
Hey, hey, hey.

224
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,639
Jerry, you wouldn't believe
what it's like down there.

225
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,301
Taxi cab drivers are insane.
You know, everybody is in a hurry.

226
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,674
I can't eat with you
leaning over like this.

227
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,338
Just look straight forward.

228
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,086
- Well, now I can't see Jerry.
- I look about the same.

229
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,085
- What?
- I was talking to him.

230
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,019
- What?
- Never mind.

231
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,886
- Come on, what did he say?
- Never mind.

232
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,961
- Jerry, come on, what'd you say?
- What?

233
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,499
- Where'd you go?
- Go back.

234
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,796
- What'd you say?
- I said never mind.

235
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,301
Yeah, I know that.

236
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,197
I hate the counter.

237
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,637
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,675
Oh, I hate the counter.

239
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,210
Yeah, who's that?

240
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,506
I got a 212 number...

241
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,149
...from this little old lady
in my building, Mrs. Krantz.

242
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,682
- She didn't mind?
- No, she died.

243
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,013
- That's great.
- What happened to Mrs. Krantz?

244
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,019
Elaine got a new number
because she died.

245
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,118
Newman died?

246
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,454
- What did he say?
- Some new kind of pie.

247
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,721
- I'll try a piece.
- Who's down there?

248
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,797
Hey, there's a booth.

249
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,130
- Hey, Elaine.
- Oh, hi.

250
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,630
- Did you hear about Newman?
- What?

251
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,707
So how's it going at work?
Did they get tired of it?

252
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,277
Oh, yeah.

253
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,914
- Double zero?
- It's " oo."

254
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,849
As in:

255
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,547
Your nickname's Koko?

256
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,159
One of the girls at the maid
service is named Coco.

257
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,161
- Really? Coco?
- Yeah. Coco.

258
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,458
That girl's all right.

259
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,627
You know, if I could get this
Coco woman down to Kruger...

260
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,203
...then they wouldn't be able to
call me Koko anymore.

261
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,237
Because Kruger
would never allow two Kokos.

262
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,568
Sounds like he runs a real
tight ship.

263
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,371
Say goodbye to Koko.

264
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,538
- Goodbye, Koko.
- Goodbye, Koko.

265
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,513
Jerry, this relationship
is killing me.

266
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,382
The distance, the longing,
the distance, the-

267
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,582
You know, I didn't realize it,
but I'm a needy person.

268
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,053
Kramer, maybe this relationship
isn't for you.

269
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,890
Oh, yeah? So, what am I supposed
to do? Be more like you?

270
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,033
All sealed up in here,
emotionally unavailable?

271
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,726
Paying scrubwomen
for sexual favors?

272
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,338
No. Jerry. I won't be like you.

273
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,701
Never. I'll never be like you.

274
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,777
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

275
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,940
- All right, I'm taking off.
- Okay.

276
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,183
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Oh, right.

277
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,323
It was great seeing you again.
I love your outfit.

278
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,923
No, my money.

279
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,520
- For what?
- For my maid services.

280
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,223
- You booked me for today.
- But you really didn't do any work.

281
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,662
I made the bed.

282
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,893
But you took a nap in it.

283
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,161
So?

284
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,239
I thought that was kind of
girlfriend bed-making.

285
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,807
No, that was the maid.

286
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,000
Who took the nap?

287
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,439
The girlfriend.

288
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,609
Forty dollars seems
kind of steep for a nap.

289
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,909
So, what are you saying?
That I'm a bad maid...

290
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,642
...or some kind of a prostitute?

291
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,785
Hold on.
Let's keep this sophisticated.

292
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,656
You know, I don't think I wanna be
your girlfriend or maid.

293
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,821
<i>So is this a break-up/quitting?</i>

294
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,330
Yeah. Don't ever call me
or hire me again.

295
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,130
Oh, yeah? Well, then we're through
and you're fired.

296
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,367
- Sign here.
- Yes.

297
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,737
Two-one-two,

298
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,003
Hey, what happened to the guy
I had last time?

299
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,807
Oh, you know, it's an odd thing.

300
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,951
He went out on a job,
never came back.

301
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,710
Nobody knows what happened.

302
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,150
All right. I am back in the game.

303
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,453
<i>- Hello?
- Gammy.</i>

304
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,620
<i>- No, you got the wrong number, kid.
- Gammy Krantz?</i>

305
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,961
<i>It's your grandson Bobby.
Why haven't you called?</i>

306
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,160
Oh, nuts.

307
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,040
<i>Do you hate me
because of my lazy eye?</i>

308
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:55,206
No, it's just that I've been
kind of buried over here.

309
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,043
So the kid doesn't know
his grandmother is dead?

310
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,483
- G-5.
- Hit.

311
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,645
No, I guess his parents
didn't wanna tell him.

312
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,314
- B-2?
- Miss.

313
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,688
He called six times yesterday.

314
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,695
What a nightmare it must be
to have a real family.

315
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,799
I wouldn't worry about it.

316
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,128
- B-6?
- Hit.

317
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,099
You sank my submarine.

318
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,296
Elaine?

319
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,080
<i>- Hello?
- You have a collect call from-</i>

320
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,583
<i>- Hey, buddy, don't say no!
- I accept.</i>

321
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,745
I went down to Madeline's.
I told her you gotta move or it's over.

322
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,255
- Well, what happened?
- I think it's over.

323
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,524
We had a big fight,
she threw me out...

324
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,788
...I started walking
and now I'm lost downtown.

325
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,762
I don't have any money.
I don't recognize anybody.

326
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,665
I miss home.
I don't even know how to get there.

327
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,169
- What's around you?
- I'm looking at Ray's Pizza.

328
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,469
- You know where that is?
- Is it Famous Ray's?

329
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,614
- No, it's Original Ray's.
- Famous Original Ray's?

330
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,214
It's just Original, Jerry.

331
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,241
Well, what street are you on?

332
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,917
Okay, I'm on 1st and 1st.

333
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,650
How can the same street
intersect with itself?

334
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,624
I must be at the nexus
of the universe.

335
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,263
Just wait there. I'll pick you up.
And Kramer...

336
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,891
...stay alive. No matter what occurs,
I will find you.

337
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,604
- You Steinfeld?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,835
My name is Maxwell.
I'm from Maid to Order.

339
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,808
It's a pun.

340
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,210
- I sent one of my girls to your place.
- Cindy.

341
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,146
She says she had a little problem
with you, you didn't pay.

342
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,583
She didn't really do
what she was supposed to do.

343
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,745
Oh, yeah? She told me
what you like.

344
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,550
You're a little sickie, aren't you?

345
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,125
Disinfectant on the blinds,
vacuuming the couch.

346
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,694
Hey, hey, come on, come on.
I gotta live around here.

347
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,162
You know what I do to people
who stiff me on a job?

348
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,995
- What?
- It kind of depends on the situation.

349
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,627
But if I don't get my money from you,
I'm gonna get it from her.

350
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,639
I don't want any trouble.
You want the money, here it is.

351
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,606
Give it to the girl.

352
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,802
I'm an independent contractor.

353
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,141
Tax purposes.

354
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,446
Bobby, you gotta
stop calling your gammy.

355
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,884
Why?

356
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,490
Because sometimes you call
very early in the morning...

357
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,652
...when Gammy has been out late
the night before.

358
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,957
And sometimes
when Gammy's not alone.

359
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,397
Your parents still haven't said
anything to you about your gammy?

360
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,830
All right. Here we go.

361
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,868
Gammy doesn't feel so good.

362
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,446
I think Gammy might be dying.

363
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,711
Yup, yup. Okay. Goodbye, Bobby.
Don't call anymore.

364
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,252
I'm dead now. Gotta go.

365
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,551
Nine-one-one.

366
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,320
Nexus of the universe.

367
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,662
Hey.

368
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,463
Cindy. Cindy.

369
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,331
- What do you want?
- Here. I got your money.

370
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,338
I don't want any money from you.

371
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,602
Come on, take it. It's money.

372
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,612
<i>- Let me give it to you.
- Looking for a good time, sir?</i>

373
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,343
You wanna step out of the car,
sickie?

374
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,053
Well, this is all very sophisticated.

375
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,089
All right, hang on, Gammy.
You're gonna make it.

376
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,929
Hey, you look a little lost.

377
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,300
- You from around here?
- No.

378
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,339
- You know where you're going?
- Not really.

379
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,307
My friend was supposed to pick
me up. I don't know where he is.

380
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,242
Doesn't sound like much
of a friend.

381
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,281
- You got any money?
- No.

382
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,783
You wanna make some?

383
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,582
Okay.

384
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,749
Do you know how
to use a mop wringer?

385
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,758
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,795
Why don't you get in the car?

387
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,497
Hi.

388
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,933
These are soft seats.

389
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,312
Hey, Koko, who's this?

390
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,819
This is our new vice president
of acquisitions, sir.

391
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,652
So you're just hiring
new people now?

392
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,657
That's your job?
To hire people?

393
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,324
Yes.

394
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,830
Okay, good enough for me, Koko.

395
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,273
- Well, what's your name?
- My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.

396
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,504
- What, Coco?
- We can't have two Cocos.

397
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,710
So I guess you're back
to being George.

398
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,115
Well, it was a hell of a ride.

399
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,652
All right. The Grace Building.

400
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,191
There's a big stain on the front.
How do we get it off?

401
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,662
When I was a little girl in Jamaica...

402
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,263
...my gammy taught me
to take a wet rag and-

403
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:19,428
Excuse me, vice president Coco.
No one cares about your gammy.

404
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,169
What did you say
about my gammy?

405
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,365
Forget Gammy.

406
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,703
- Who's Gammy?
- There's no Gammy.

407
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,572
Maybe there should be a Gammy.

408
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,207
- Oh, no.
- George.

409
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,546
<i>Gammy. Gammy. Gammy.
Gammy. Gammy. Gammy.</i>

410
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,745
Gammy's getting upset.
