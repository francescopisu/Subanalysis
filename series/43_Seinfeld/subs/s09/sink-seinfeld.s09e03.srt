1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,569
I got no legroom back here.
Move your seat forward.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,105
It's as far as it goes.

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,573
There's a mechanism. You just pull it
and throw your body weight.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,906
I pulled it, it doesn't go.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,572
If you want the legroom, say you want
the room. Don't blame the mechanism.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,187
All right, Dad, we're five blocks
from the house. Sit sideways.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,118
Like an animal. Because of her,
I have to sit like an animal.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,884
Serenity now! Serenity now!

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,550
What is that?

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,753
Doctor gave me
a relaxation cassette.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,625
When my blood pressure
gets too high...

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,791
...the man on the tape tells me to say,
"Serenity now."

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,693
Are you supposed to yell it?

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,964
The man on the tape
wasn't specific.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,539
What happened to the screen door?
It blew off again?

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,735
I told you to fix that thing.

17
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,278
Serenity now!

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,651
I told Bobby and Lisa we'd try that new
Chinese-Spanish place on Saturday.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,951
Thought we had tickets
to the Knicks home opener.

20
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,061
Well, I thought this would be more fun
so I gave the tickets away.

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,060
What?

22
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,994
All right, fine.

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,823
Are you mad at me?

24
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,234
No, I love a good Chinese-Spanish
whatever it is.

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,569
You know, I've never seen you mad.

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,732
I get peeved.

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,503
- Mad.
- Miffed.

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,306
- Mad.
- Irked?

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,677
I would like to see you
get really mad.

30
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,884
Why does she want you to be mad?

31
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,752
She says I suppress my emotions.

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,689
So, what do you care
what she thinks?

33
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,325
Good body.

34
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,631
She probably gets that impression
because you're cool.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,236
You're under control. Like me.
Nothing wrong with that.

36
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,535
But I get upset. I've yelled.
You've heard me yell.

37
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,835
Not really. Your voice kind of raises
to this comedic pitch.

38
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,206
Hey.

39
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,610
Kramer, I am so sick of you coming
in here and eating all of my food.

40
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,014
Now, shut that door
and get the hell out of here.

41
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,658
What is that, a new bit?

42
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,453
I told you.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,963
Any of you wanna come and help me
fix my father's screen door in Queens?

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,364
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door
in the Bronx.

45
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,764
- I'll do it.
- Really, you wanna come?

46
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,803
Yeah, I love going to the country.

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,471
- Where are they going?
- Fix a screen door in Queens.

48
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,480
That's funny.

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,582
Hey, listen,
what are you doing Saturday?

50
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,381
Not going to the Knick game.

51
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,018
I need somebody to go with me
to Mr. Lippman's son's bar mitzvah.

52
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,889
You know, if you don't bring a guest,
they save on catering.

53
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:47,465
- Should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
- Oh, I don't think that's possible.

54
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,433
And get a little closer
because I can't see the screen door.

55
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,473
Yeah.

56
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,875
- Perfect.
- Dad, the hinges are all rusted here.

57
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,106
That's why the wind keeps blowing
the door off.

58
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,719
I hate that old door. Throw it out!

59
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,013
Serenity now.

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,181
Might be time to just let her go, Frank.
She's worked hard for you.

61
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,417
- Will you put her to rest for me?
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,960
- I'll take good care of her.
- Okay.

63
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:27,562
And get George to put those boxes
in the garage.

64
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,105
- Dad, what is all this?
- It's junk.

65
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,474
My computers. I've been selling them
for two months now.

66
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,171
Shut up.

67
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,775
You're selling computers?

68
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,085
Two months ago, I saw
a provocative movie on cable TV.

69
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,953
<i>It was called The Net,
with that girl from the bus.</i>

70
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,391
I did a little reading and I realized
it wasn't that far-fetched.

71
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,898
Dad, do you know what it takes
to compete with Microsoft and IBM?

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,902
Yes, I do.
That's why I've got a secret weapon.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,308
My son.

74
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,739
Damn it, they gave me cream.
I asked for nonfat milk.

75
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,976
I think they have one percent
over there.

76
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:17,748
One percent?
They can kiss one percent of my ass.

77
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,086
Okay, Jerry, enough.
I'm not buying it.

78
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,627
You're damn right
you're not buying it.

79
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,499
You shouldn't have to try.
It's just being open.

80
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,103
I'm open.
There's just nothing in there.

81
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,605
- Oh, you think I'm lying?
- I think you are.

82
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,639
- Well, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. Liar.

83
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,436
- Oh, stop it.
- Okay, liar.

84
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,669
That's enough.

85
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,105
That was good.

86
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,215
Really? It felt good.

87
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,380
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.

88
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,842
Oh, Elaine.

89
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,522
My boy's a man today.
Can you believe it?

90
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,855
- He's a man.
- Oh, congratulations, Adam.

91
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,462
I'm a man.

92
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,806
- Tongue?
- Yeah.

93
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,208
I didn't try that till I was 23.

94
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,480
Well, this kid's not just a man,
he's a man's man.

95
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,150
And I think he's been telling
his friends.

96
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,155
I got invitations
to six more bar mitzvahs.

97
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,959
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
No. No. No.

98
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,621
I do not wanna stop over
in Cincinnati.

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,961
Well, then you upgrade me.

100
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:40,071
That's right, you should thank me.
Goodbye.

101
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,571
Hey, I'm flying first class.

102
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,375
Where did that come from?

103
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,535
Patty showed me how to get mad.

104
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,374
You got a problem with that?

105
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,074
- No.
- Good.

106
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,275
All right, relax, tough guy.

107
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,251
I gotta get out to my father's garage.
Help him sell computers.

108
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,051
The two of you working in that garage
is like a steel-cage death match.

109
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,529
- Kramer?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,927
What are you doing?

111
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,228
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's
screen door.

112
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,394
This beauty has got a little life
in her yet.

113
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,039
What do you need it for?

114
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,608
The cool evening breezes
of Anytown, U.S.A.

115
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,042
See how this baby closes.

116
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,281
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,480
- Morning, Ma.
- You're late.

118
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,882
- Morning, Dad.
- I'm not Dad in the work place.

119
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,754
My professional name
is Mr. Costanza...

120
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,020
...and I will refer to you
as Costanza.

121
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,096
- Morning, Braun.
- Hey, George.

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,292
Two cream, no sugar.

123
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,403
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?

124
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,673
- Your mother recommended him.
- Yeah, of course she did.

125
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,206
All I ever heard growing up is:

126
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,276
"Why can't you be more like
Lloyd Braun?"

127
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,242
You know he was in
a mental institution?

128
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,275
I didn't read his résumé.

129
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,483
Another sale, Mr. Costanza.
Chalk me up on the big board.

130
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,288
- What is this?
- This is your lagging.

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,260
- Good work, Braun.
- Good for you, Lloyd.

132
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,936
So, Adam, I just talked to your father
and apology accepted.

133
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,673
I'm not apologizing. It was great.
I told everyone.

134
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,177
Yeah, I know.
By the way, could you do me a favor...

135
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,941
...and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that
I'll be unable to attend this Saturday?

136
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,942
Are you free Friday night?

137
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,420
I am, but that is not the point.

138
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,789
You are 13
and I am in my early 20s.

139
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,523
But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.

140
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,029
No, you are not a man.

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,430
It takes a long time
to become a man.

142
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,900
I mean, half my friends
aren't even there yet.

143
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,139
Well, if I'm not a man,
then this whole thing was a sham.

144
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,335
First he said
I was gonna get great gifts...

145
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,571
...and then somebody
gives me Boggle.

146
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,317
- I renounce my religion.
- Who wants cookies?

147
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,716
As of this moment,
I am no longer Jewish. I quit.

148
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,888
Walnuts.

149
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,757
You're late again, Costanza,
so listen up.

150
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,396
Starting tonight,
we're having a little sales contest.

151
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,591
The loser gets fired,
the winner gets a Waterpik.

152
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,498
You're not giving away
our Waterpik!

153
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,104
Serenity now.

154
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,538
You know what?
It doesn't matter, because I quit.

155
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,075
I guess your mother was right.

156
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,770
You never could compete
with Lloyd Braun.

157
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,549
You want to sell computers?
I will show you how to sell computers.

158
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,554
Hello, Mr. Finerman.
You wanna buy a computer?

159
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,291
No? Why not?

160
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,437
All right, I see.
Good answer. Thank you.

161
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,409
Serenity now!

162
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,312
Adam, you don't become a man
overnight.

163
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:14,419
Look at your father. It takes time,
patience, experience...

164
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,045
...several careers
of varying success.

165
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,751
These are things
that I look for in a man.

166
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:26,388
Well, that does me a lot of good.
"Early 20s."

167
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,931
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.

168
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,003
So that's the type of guy
you're looking for?

169
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,902
I guess so. Why?

170
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,772
- What is this?
- Anytown, U.S.A.

171
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,510
Hello. Is Kramer home?

172
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,417
Oh, hey.

173
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,482
Hello, neighbor.

174
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,751
Boy, those azaleas
are really coming in nicely.

175
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,589
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.

176
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,926
- You barbecuing tonight?
- Right after the fireworks.

177
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,699
So where do you wanna eat tonight?

178
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,467
How about going back
to La Caridad?

179
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,944
Again?
How much flan can a person eat?

180
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,842
Jerry, you've been yelling at me
all afternoon.

181
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,385
Well, I don't think more flan
is the answer.

182
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,648
- Maybe I should just leave.
- Maybe?

183
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,520
- Goodbye.
- Double goodbye.

184
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,391
Hey, buddy.

185
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,363
Hey, happy New Year.

186
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,003
Y'all come back real-

187
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,742
- Did you and Patty just break up?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,108
In fact, she broke up with me.
And I don't wanna talk about it.

189
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,147
Then you're free tonight. I heard about
this great place called La Caridad.

190
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,849
That's the last thing she said to me.

191
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,993
She wanted to go there also,
but I wasn't in the mood.

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,994
- Oh, what is the matter?
- It's Patty.

193
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,327
Jerry, you break up with a girl
every week.

194
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,099
What is this salty discharge?

195
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,438
Oh, my God, you're crying.

196
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,603
This is horrible.

197
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,348
I care.

198
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,517
Patty won't call me back.
I don't know if I can live without her.

199
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,558
She's really gotten to you,
hasn't she?

200
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,992
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- It's simple.

201
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,622
You let out one emotion,
all the rest will come with it.

202
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,962
It's like Endora's box.

203
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,594
<i>That was the mother on Bewitched.
You mean Pandora.</i>

204
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,742
Yeah, well, she had one too.

205
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,570
Jerry, can I talk to you for a minute?

206
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,955
That's it. That's it,
I warned you kids.

207
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,284
I told you not to play in front
of my house.

208
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,950
This time, I'm keeping it.

209
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,625
And you're not getting your rock
back either.

210
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,629
Hall urchins.

211
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,137
Are you still down in the dumps?
Come on, it's just a chick.

212
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,469
You ever heard of a little thing
called feelings?

213
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,111
Well, I got just the thing
to cheer you up.

214
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,304
A computer.

215
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,916
You could check porn
and stock quotes.

216
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,980
Porn quotes.

217
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,646
I'm so lucky to have
a friend like you, George.

218
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,020
I ever tell you how much I love you?

219
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,898
- What?
- I love you, George.

220
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,833
- Come here.
- I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here.

221
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,599
You know what, if you want
a computer, call me. I gotta go.

222
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,573
Go wherever you want,
I'm still gonna love you.

223
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,409
Look what they did.
Look what they did to my house.

224
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,070
I turn my back for two seconds...

225
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,444
...and they put shaving cream
all over the door.

226
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,381
Yeah, I see you!

227
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,214
I'm gonna teach these kids
a lesson.

228
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,288
Where's that hose
I put under your sink?

229
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,948
Hose under my sink.
I love you, Kramer.

230
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,720
- I love you too. And George-
- I don't wanna hear it.

231
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,729
When I give you the signal,
turn this water on full blast.

232
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,300
- Signal? What signal?
- I don't know, I'll yell hoochie mama.

233
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,869
All right, if I do it,
will you buy a computer?

234
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,699
On the signal, George.
On the signal.

235
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,534
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.

236
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,903
- I love you, Costanza.
- Will you shut up?

237
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,638
Now, George! Turn on the faucet.
George, turn on the faucet.

238
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:42,514
Hoochie mama. Hoochie mama.
Hoochie mama.

239
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,051
So, now, the other Lippman
kissed me.

240
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,383
Oh, sure.
They're Jewish and you're a shiksa.

241
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,586
- What?
- It means non-Jewish woman.

242
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,358
I know what it means. But what does
being a shiksa have to do with it?

243
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,591
You've got shiks-appeal.

244
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,259
Jewish men love a woman
that's not like their mother.

245
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,962
- Oh, that's insane.
- I'll tell you what's insane.

246
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,041
The price that I could get you
on a new desktop computer.

247
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,943
- I am not buying a computer from you.
- There's porn.

248
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,509
Even so.

249
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,050
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman.
I'm very flattered...

250
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,556
...that you found me attractive enough
to lunge at me.

251
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,627
But the only reason you like me
is because I'm a shiksa.

252
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,026
That's simply not true.

253
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,462
If you weren't Jewish,
you wouldn't be interested.

254
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,467
- You are wrong. I'll prove it.
- Oh, no, don't.

255
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,366
I renounce Judaism.

256
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,737
What happened to you, pal?

257
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,107
Joey Zanfino and some
of the neighborhood kids...

258
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,375
...they ambushed me with a box
of Grade A's.

259
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,214
- Are you all right?
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Fine. Serenity now.

260
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,423
Serenity now. Serenity now.

261
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,117
So you're using Frank's
relaxation method?

262
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,425
Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off.
Serenity now.

263
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,334
Serenity now.

264
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,976
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Serenity.

265
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,213
Well...

266
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,610
...you are not gonna believe this.
Now Lippman has renounced.

267
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,948
This shiksa thing
is totally out of control.

268
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,990
What is with you people?

269
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,627
- What are you looking at?
- Sit down, Elaine.

270
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,961
Oh, no, Jerry, I can't take any more
gentle sobbing.

271
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,660
I've been thinking about what it means
to be complete.

272
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,826
Do you have an apple?

273
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,599
Look at us, hurtling through space
on this big blue marble.

274
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,766
Or a nectarine.
I would love a nectarine.

275
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,139
Looking everywhere
for some kind of meaning.

276
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,713
Why am I in such a fruit mood?
Banana.

277
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,146
When all the while,
the real secret to happiness...

278
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,309
...has been right here in front of us.

279
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,056
- What?
- Elaine-

280
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,683
Jerry, I found a way
to beat Lloyd Braun.

281
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,556
I buy the computers myself,
I store them in your apartment.

282
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,961
Then after I win the contest, I bring
them all back, I get my money back.

283
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,828
It's brilliant.

284
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,127
Wait, what's wrong with your leg?

285
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,864
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.

286
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,942
I'll store these over
at Kramer's apartment.

287
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,607
It's all right.

288
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,276
All fine.

289
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,349
Elaine-

290
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,585
Jerry, I've got a lot going on
with Lippman right now.

291
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,163
- Lippman?
- Yeah, and him too.

292
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,096
What?

293
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,132
Oh, yeah.

294
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,295
I think George is calling me,
so I'm gonna go and give him a hand.

295
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,772
- Come on. Come on!
- Can I help you?

296
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,935
Stay. Stay. Stay.

297
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,873
Hey, Braun,
Costanza's kicking your butt.

298
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,881
Watch how it's done.

299
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,923
Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay.

300
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,954
Would you like to buy a computer?

301
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,625
Oh, really? Two dozen.

302
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,188
Costanza, you're white hot.

303
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,058
<i>If you'd like to make call,
please hang up and-</i>

304
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,300
Hey, Braun,
I got good news and bad news.

305
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,501
- They're both the same. You're fired.
- Costanza, you won the Waterpik.

306
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,238
You're not gonna give away
that Waterpik.

307
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,441
You wanna bet?
Serenity now. Serenity now.

308
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:37,655
You know, you should tell your dad
that " serenity now" thing doesn't work.

309
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,519
It just bottles up the anger
and then, eventually...

310
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,091
- ...you blow.
- What do you know?

311
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,162
- You were in the nut house.
- What do you think put me there?

312
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,666
I heard they found a family
in your freezer.

313
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,802
Serenity now...

314
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,561
...insanity later.

315
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,632
What happened here, Kramer?

316
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,141
- Serenity now. Serenity now.
- Kramer.

317
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,246
Jerry. I didn't hear you come in.

318
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,182
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the children,
they've done some redecorating.

319
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,152
You don't look well.

320
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,291
That's odd, because I feel perfectly
at peace with the world.

321
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,258
Eggs, you.

322
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,596
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me,
I stepped on your last rose.

323
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,704
Jerry, come on.
Don't get so upset about it.

324
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,739
There's always next spring.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

325
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,872
Serenity now!

326
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,310
Jerry, I did it. I beat Braun.

327
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,506
Serenity now.

328
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,947
Come on. Lend me a hand
with the computers?

329
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,679
Serenity now!

330
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,291
Why couldn't you squeeze one
of those stupid rubber balls...

331
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,686
...to get your stress out?

332
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,853
Why did you have to destroy
25 computers?

333
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,160
George, you listen to me...

334
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,330
...I owe you one.

335
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,731
All right?

336
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,972
He's incorrigible.

337
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,042
- You wanna talk about it?
- Please don't tell me...

338
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,514
...you love me again, Jerry.
I can't handle it.

339
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,246
George, letting my emotions out
was the best thing I've ever done.

340
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,050
Sure, I'm not funny anymore...

341
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:25,520
...but there's more to life than making
shallow, fairly obvious observations.

342
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,096
How about you?

343
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,795
All right.

344
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,664
Here it goes.

345
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,412
Rabbi, is there anything I can do
to combat this shiks-appeal?

346
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,312
Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth.
Like the yeti...

347
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,854
...or his North American cousin,
the Sasquatch.

348
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,114
Well, something's going on here...

349
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,227
...because every able-bodied Israelite
in the county...

350
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,386
...is driving pretty strong
to the hoop.

351
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,159
Elaine, there's much you don't
understand about the Jewish religion.

352
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:07,135
For example, did you know
that rabbis are allowed to date?

353
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,297
Well, what does that have to do-?

354
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,203
You know, a member
of my congregation...

355
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,640
...has a time-share in Myrtle Beach.

356
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,677
Perhaps if you're not too busy...

357
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,748
...we could wing on down
after the High Holidays.

358
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,413
Elaine?

359
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,646
Lainey?

360
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,988
So that's it.

361
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,923
All of my darkest fears...

362
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,290
...and everything I'm capable of.

363
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,988
That's me.

364
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,074
Well, good luck with all that.

365
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,439
Where are you going?

366
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,171
I thought I could count on you
for a little compassion.

367
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,144
I think you scared me straight.

368
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,445
- All right, Jerome, I'm in.
- What?

369
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,282
Maybe we should get married.

370
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,187
Maybe everything we need
is right here in front of us.

371
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,487
Jer, let's do it.

372
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,254
I tell you, I don't see it happening.

373
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,029
What?
What happened to the new Jerry?

374
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,828
He doesn't work here anymore.

375
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,664
Oh, well, that's just great!

376
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,870
- I love you, Jerry.
- Right back at you, slick.

377
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,682
You know, all these years...

378
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,945
...I've always wanted to see
the two of you get back together.

379
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,183
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

380
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,604
You single-handedly...

381
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,536
...brought Costanza and Son
to the brink of bankruptcy.

382
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,573
Well, what about
all the Lloyd Braun sales?

383
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,474
He was crazy.
His phone wasn't even hooked up.

384
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,213
He just liked ringing that bell.

385
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,378
I told you to clean up this garage.

386
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,183
I have to put my car in.

387
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,015
This is a place of business.

388
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,822
I told you never to come in here.
Serenity now.

389
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,331
All right.

390
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,660
Dad, you really should lay off
the serenity-now stuff.

391
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,397
So, what am I supposed to say?

392
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,105
Hoochie mama.

393
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,412
Move your crap, I'm coming in.

394
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,579
No, you're not.

395
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,620
Hoochie mama. Hoochie mama.
