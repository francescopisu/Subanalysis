1
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,193
So you're saying UNICEF
is a scam?

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,034
It's the perfect cover
for a money-laundering operation.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,199
No one could keep track
of all those kids...

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,641
...with those little orange boxes
of change.

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,372
Oh, no. It's Sally Weaver.

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,880
Oh, yeah,
your old college roommate, huh?

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,781
No, it's Susan Ross'
old college roommate.

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,946
She moved to New York.
She's trying to become an actress.

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,284
Dramatic or comedic?

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,926
Untalented.
She's always inviting me to see her...

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,824
...in some bad play in a tiny room
without ventilation.

12
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,328
It's really depressing.

13
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,558
Well, we don't go to enough theater.

14
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,362
She should just give up.

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,762
- Hey.
- Hey there...

16
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,203
...Mr.
Too-Big-to-Come-to-My-Shows.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,969
I just came from tap. I'm all:

18
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,308
I'm on my way to an audition,
still looking for that big break.

19
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,972
Why don't you just give up?

20
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,542
Kramer.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,619
Well, that's what Jerry says.

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,424
Oh, now, face it. If it hasn't happened,
it's not gonna happen.

23
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,892
All right. Now, go grab us a booth.
Join us?

24
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,634
So Susan's dead.

25
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,510
Well, I think she was happy
someone finally said it.

26
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,808
Why did you have to say
anything to her?

27
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,816
Well, I felt the conversation
was lagging.

28
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,614
Why can't you ever just keep
your big mouth shut?

29
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,320
I come in here to have
a pleasant meal...

30
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,791
...and if we're not gonna have one,
I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.

31
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,856
You know, maybe Kramer was right.

32
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,968
Some people should just give up.
I have.

33
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,229
- What did you wanna be?
- I don't remember...

34
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,771
...but it certainly wasn't this.

35
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,739
<i>Look at this cartoon
in The New Yorker.</i>

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,208
- I don't get this.
- Me neither.

37
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,677
And you're on the fringe
of the humor business.

38
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,880
Hey.

39
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,076
Hey, George, look at this.

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,151
- That's cute.
- You get it?

41
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,681
No, never mind.

42
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,160
Come on.
We're two intelligent people here.

43
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,795
We can figure this out.

44
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,700
Now, we got a dog
and a cat in an office.

45
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,737
It looks like my accountant's office.
There's no pets working there.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,539
The cat is saying, "I've enjoyed
reading your e-mail."

47
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,042
It's got something to do
with that 42 in the corner.

48
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,237
That's a page number.

49
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,583
Well, I can't crack this one.

50
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,412
Oh, this has gotta be a mistake.

51
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,883
Well, try shaking it.

52
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,749
Well, Janet should be here
any minute.

53
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,122
You've been hiding her.
You must really like her.

54
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,764
Jerry, the minute I saw this girl,
we just clicked.

55
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,423
She's got such a nice face.

56
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,933
Her eyes, her mouth, nose.

57
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,901
We know what a face consists of.

58
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,242
I'm sorry I'm late.

59
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,344
Jerry, Elaine, I give you Janet.

60
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,536
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

61
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,908
Hi. Do we still have time
to make the movie?

62
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,344
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,714
We just can't go to the supermarket
to get some candy.

64
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,353
Jerry, she looks exactly like you.

65
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,897
She does not.

66
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,335
You know, maybe she doesn't.
I don't care.

67
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,969
- Hey, Kramer.
- Well, hey. You got some messages.

68
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,544
Yeah. George, George, Elaine.
George again.

69
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,944
Elaine. Newman.
But that was a crank call.

70
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,553
Yeah, and some Sally woman called,
says thanks a lot.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,553
Yeah, she's quitting the business.
You ruined her life.

72
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,650
What?
You're the one who ruined her life.

73
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,294
Well, that's not how
she remembers it.

74
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,293
Well, I gotta talk her out of this.

75
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,227
I thought you said she stinks.

76
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,562
She does stink.
And she should quit.

77
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,567
But I don't want it to be
because of me.

78
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,365
It should be the traditional route.

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,132
Years of rejection and failure...

80
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,243
...until she's spit out
the bottom of the porn industry.

81
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,411
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, George and Janet.</i>

82
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,518
- Oh, who's Janet, huh?
- George's girlfriend.

83
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,586
Elaine thinks she looks like me...

84
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,315
...but I think it's, as you would say,
kooky talk.

85
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,257
You know what woman
I always thought you looked like?

86
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,452
Lena Horne.

87
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,390
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, George.

88
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,762
And you must look
exactly like Jerry.

89
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,004
You don't see this?
Oh, you're like twins.

90
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,166
This is eerie.

91
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,945
Kramer, what are you talking about?

92
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,139
Janet doesn't look anything
like Jerry.

93
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,147
Maybe we do look
a little like each other.

94
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,617
No, what do you know
about what you look like?

95
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,684
Come on, George. Relax.
Just because they look alike...

96
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,884
...that doesn't mean
you're secretly in love with Jerry.

97
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,092
All right, we're going now. Bye-bye.

98
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,099
- We just got here, George.
- Well, it's getting dark.

99
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,868
Yeah, she's a nice girl,
kind of quiet, though.

100
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,839
What are you doing?

101
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,205
Don't tell a woman
she looks like a man.

102
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,076
George doesn't wanna hear his
girlfriend looks like me, neither do I.

103
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,551
Well, how should I have broached
the subject?

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,156
You don't broach.
You keep your mouth shut.

105
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,315
Well, sounds like someone's
having a bad day.

106
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,084
Yeah, because of you.

107
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,355
Well, then I think one of us
should leave.

108
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,905
Sally, you can't quit the business.

109
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,409
This is all because of me?

110
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,608
You can't give up.
You don't think people tell me I stink?

111
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,615
When I'm on-stage that's all I hear.

112
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,880
"You stink. You suck.
We like magic."

113
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,752
- Really?
- Of course.

114
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,794
I stink. You stink. It's show biz.
Everybody stinks.

115
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,855
Yeah, you've been stinking
since the '80s.

116
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,933
All right, I think we've covered
my act.

117
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,764
Now, you get out there
and stink it up with everybody else.

118
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,874
All right. Yes.
Thank you. I'm gonna do it.

119
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,840
Now.

120
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,443
Well, I've asked everyone at work
and no one gets this cartoon.

121
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,987
I don't understand why, but I am
gonna get to the bottom of this.

122
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,250
Oh, I think we're at the bottom.

123
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,492
Hey, George.
Janet seems really nice.

124
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,696
And she's quite
a handsome woman.

125
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,165
- What does that mean?
- Yeah, what does that mean?

126
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,171
What do you mean by that?

127
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,139
Enjoy.

128
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,078
- Elaine, huh? She's completely-
- Oh, I know.

129
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,413
- Because you don't think Janet-
- No.

130
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,256
- Why would I?
- It's ludicrous.

131
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,414
Yes.

132
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,616
- Neither one of us.
- No.

133
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,728
- So.
- Exactly.

134
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,353
I'm not gay.

135
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,995
Neither am I.

136
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,568
- Kramer, get in here.
- Kramer. Kramer.

137
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,266
Where's that crazy man? Come on.

138
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,502
Kramer, come on in here.

139
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,339
- Come on.
- Kramer, what are you doing?

140
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,538
- Come in.
- Finally.

141
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,773
What are you doing?
Come and talk to us.

142
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,315
I've made an important life decision.

143
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,321
- Let's talk about that.
- Don't leave.

144
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,519
All right. I know I've been kind
of shooting off at the mouth lately.

145
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,564
First, with that girl whose life
you destroyed...

146
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,361
...and then about George
dating a lady Jerry.

147
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,569
What's the decision?

148
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,865
I know you want me
to keep my big mouth shut.

149
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,804
Well, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

150
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,501
- I'm never gonna talk again.
- Yeah, right.

151
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,115
What do I need to talk for, huh?
What, to blab to the neighbors...

152
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,615
...about how George
has a new fem-Jerry friend?

153
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,187
Or to tell everybody at the coffee shop
how George is all mixed up...

154
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:14,053
...in a perverse sexual amalgam
of some girl and his best friend?

155
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,156
See, now, I've done all that.

156
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,265
Now, it's time for silence.

157
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,095
Silence? Yes.

158
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,961
You're never gonna be able
to completely stop talking.

159
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,596
Jerry, 94 percent
of communication is nonverbal.

160
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,606
Here, watch.

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,210
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

162
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,577
Well, what does this mean?

163
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,746
Well, it's Frank
and Estelle's reaction...

164
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,791
...to hearing about George's
man love for a she-Jerry.

165
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:53,588
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- That's the idea.

166
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,098
Kramer, there's no way
you stick to this.

167
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,898
- Oh, you're gonna start now?
- That's right.

168
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,238
Right now.

169
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,741
That hurts.

170
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,736
Now.

171
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,485
So J. Peterman wants to hire
some of our cartoonists...

172
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,985
...to illustrate your catalog?

173
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,488
Well, we're hoping that if,
perhaps the catalog is a little funnier...

174
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,095
...people won't be so quick
to return the clothes.

175
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,764
For example,
you know, I really do...

176
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,129
Well, I love this one.

177
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,500
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's a rather clever jab...

178
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,664
...at inter-office politics,
don't you think?

179
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,533
Yeah.

180
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,977
But why is it that the animals
enjoy reading the e-mail?

181
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,380
Well, Miss Benes...

182
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,820
...cartoons are like gossamer
and one doesn't dissect gossamer.

183
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,517
Well, you don't have to dissect it...

184
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,791
...if you could just tell me
why this is supposed to be funny.

185
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,993
Oh, it's merely a commentary
on contemporary mores.

186
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,005
But what is the comment?

187
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,840
- It's a slice of life.
- No, it isn't.

188
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,808
- A pun?
- I don't think so.

189
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,311
Vorshtein?

190
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,781
That's not a word.

191
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,177
- You have no idea what this means.
- No.

192
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,551
- Then why did you print it?
- I like the kitty.

193
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,221
You know what? You people
should be ashamed of yourselves.

194
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,625
You know, you doodle
a couple of bears at a cocktail party...

195
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,062
...talking about the stock market,
you think you're doing comedy.

196
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,229
Actually, that's not bad.

197
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,807
Oh, really? Oh, yes.
Well, you know, I have others.

198
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,541
Sally, I can't believe you're already
doing a one-woman show.

199
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,875
No, it's just a little performance
piece I wrote.

200
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,077
But you know what?
You really inspired me, okay, a tear.

201
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,918
Hey, there you are.

202
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,556
Oh, right. Code of silence.
How's that going?

203
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,366
Thank you.

204
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,528
Hi. I think you're really
gonna like this...

205
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,698
...because it's about me.
Well, all right, it's not just about me.

206
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,743
It's about me, and this guy,
Jerry Seinfeld...

207
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,614
...who I like to call the devil.

208
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,372
Okay, okay.

209
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,078
So I run into this Jerry on the street
and then he says to me:

210
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,917
"Hey, Sally, you stink.
You should give up acting."

211
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,254
Oh, I'm doing Jerry now, okay?
So you have to imagine I have horns...

212
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,022
...a tail and hooves instead of feet.

213
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,590
You know what I mean,
that guy?

214
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,892
Oh, shut up.

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,707
She does a full hour
about how you're the devil?

216
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,207
I gotta go see this thing.

217
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,074
Good luck. It's sold out
for the next three weeks.

218
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:01,214
<i>Well, I bet I can get in, once I mention
I'm from The New Yorker.</i>

219
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,254
<i>- The New Yorker?
- Yes. The New Yorker.</i>

220
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,186
I met with their cartoon editor...

221
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:11,421
...and I got him to admit that
that cartoon made no sense.

222
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,399
Wow, good work, Nancy Drew.

223
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,463
So we ended up going out
to lunch...

224
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,298
...and he had some great gossip
about James Thurber.

225
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,940
Nodding off.

226
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,238
And he said I could submit
some of my own cartoons.

227
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,143
Wow, that's incredible,
but you don't draw.

228
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,583
- I do too.
- What, your sad little horsies?

229
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,147
The house with the little curl
of smoke.

230
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,654
The sunflower with the smiley face.

231
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,621
The transparent cube.

232
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,490
It's better than your drawings
of naked Lois Lane.

233
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,394
Where did you see that?
Those are private.

234
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,670
Jerry, sorry I'm late.

235
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,739
Channel Nine is doing a piece
on my show, isn't that great?

236
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,432
Do you hate me?

237
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,339
No, no, I thought the show
was terrific.

238
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,707
I was just wondering
if you have to keep saying...

239
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,872
...Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.

240
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,545
Well, that is the title.

241
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,479
I know, but I thought maybe you could
mention how I apologized...

242
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,182
...and encouraged you
to stick with it?

243
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,955
You know, I workshopped that
and snoozers.

244
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,367
But I'll tell you what, I'll tinker.
It's all a journey.

245
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,164
Thanks.
You got a little schmutz there.

246
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,332
Excuse me, Miss Weaver?
Oh, my God, it is you.

247
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,307
I've seen your show six times.

248
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,381
What a surprise.

249
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,016
You're great. It's great.

250
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,585
It's so great to see
a show that's about something.

251
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,992
Where to?

252
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,033
<i>My friends are idiots.</i>

253
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,574
<i>She doesn't look like Jerry.
She doesn't look like anybody.</i>

254
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,078
<i>And so what if she does
look like Jerry?</i>

255
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,236
<i>What does that mean?</i>

256
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,406
<i>That I'd have everything
I have with Jerry...</i>

257
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,020
<i>...but because it's a woman
I could also have sex with her?</i>

258
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,214
<i>And that somehow, that would be
exactly what I always wanted?</i>

259
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,854
<i>She doesn't even look like Jerry.</i>

260
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,020
I really do look
a lot like your friend Jerry.

261
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,631
I know.

262
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,535
<i>Thanks for watching Nine News.
We leave you tonight with a scene...</i>

263
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,699
<i>...from Sally Weaver's
one-woman show.</i>

264
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:42,109
<i>Okay, so, I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld
at this horrible coffee shop, right?</i>

265
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,908
<i>He's like, "Stop doing your show."</i>

266
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,210
<i>And I'm like,
"Hello, it's a free country."</i>

267
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,478
<i>So then he goes,
"Okay, schmutzie."</i>

268
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,781
<i>Then he starts pawing
at my sweater, right?</i>

269
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,651
<i>And getting all
"Hands Across America."</i>

270
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,123
There really was schmutz.
I didn't try and grab her.

271
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,593
<i>And this is what he looks like
when he is eating:</i>

272
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,361
Get out of my house.

273
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,397
Well, boys, I did it.

274
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,131
I had to stay up all night...

275
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,971
<i>...but I finally came up
with a great New Yorker cartoon.</i>

276
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,013
If I stayed up all night, I'd fix myself up
a little before I go out.

277
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,751
That is not the point.

278
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,513
Some mouthwash, a hat,
something.

279
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,589
Just read it.

280
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,522
Pretty good.

281
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,957
Pretty good?

282
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,598
Well, this is a gem. Kramer, lookit.

283
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,169
What? It's funny.

284
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,271
It's a pig at a complaint department.

285
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:45,206
Yeah, and he's saying,
"I wish I was taller."

286
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,806
See? That's his complaint.

287
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,312
- I get it.
- Do you?

288
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,213
Because that's not a normal
complaint.

289
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,286
Well, how about
if it was something like:

290
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,980
"I can't find my receipt.
My place is a sty."

291
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,989
You know, everything with you
has to be so jokey.

292
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,259
I'm a comedian.

293
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:14,396
"I wish I was taller. " That's nice.
That's real.

294
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,236
Yeah, well, I got a complaint.
This cartoon stinks.

295
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,339
Well, I'll tell you
who doesn't think it stinks.

296
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,677
<i>The New Yorker. That's right.</i>

297
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,910
They're publishing it
in their next issue.

298
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,516
Oh, you know what?
I just ran into Newman in the hall.

299
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,090
He said you tried
to grope Sally Weaver?

300
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:38,586
Oh, that's it.
I'm gonna put an end to this.

301
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,764
"The pig says, 'My wife is a slut" '

302
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,006
Now, that's a complaint.

303
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,849
Hello, this is Jerry.
I just wanted to leave you a message...

304
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,351
...and let you know
I caught your little piece on TV.

305
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,046
<i>I'm getting tired of hearing
about how horrible I am.</i>

306
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,521
<i>I'd really appreciate it...</i>

307
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,957
<i>...if you would just leave me out
of your act altogether.</i>

308
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,529
Well, that's it.
I'm calling in the big guns.

309
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:18,366
"-to cease and desist,
on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld."

310
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,700
Signed, crybaby
Jerry Seinfeld's lawyer.

311
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,934
Okay. Well, I've got two words
for you, Jerry Seinfeld:

312
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,908
<i>**** you.</i>

313
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,050
How could she say that on TV?

314
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,449
And how did she get a cable special?
I've never gotten a cable special.

315
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,551
Well, that's it. I'm not giving her any
more material. We are incommunicado.

316
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,596
Exactly.

317
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,168
<i>Check it out. From the new issue
of The New Yorker.</i>

318
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,802
- It's funny, isn't it?
- No.

319
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,568
Look at it.
The pig wants to be taller.

320
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,874
And what's this guy gonna say, huh?
Nothing.

321
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,975
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred
yet another flat tire.

322
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,810
Can I fix that after lunch, sir?

323
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,353
Oh, no, right away. Chop-chop.

324
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:17,423
A new cartoon. "I wish I was taller."

325
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,299
I'd like to see
that complaint get rectified.

326
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,162
You see? See?
Smart people think this is funny.

327
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,673
And you wanna know why?
Because I wrote it.

328
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,812
You shouldn't make fun of pigs.

329
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,279
Flash of lightning, Elaine.

330
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,644
I just realized
why I like this cartoon so much.

331
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,685
- Oh, do tell, sir.
- It's a "Ziggy."

332
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,947
A "Ziggy"?

333
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,887
That irreverence. That wit.
I'd recognize it anywhere.

334
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,084
Some charlatan
has stolen a "Ziggy"...

335
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,697
...and passed it off
as his own and I can prove it.

336
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,663
Quick, Elaine, to my archives.

337
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,801
You know what's great
about our relationship?

338
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,309
- It's not about looks.
- It's not?

339
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,003
No, it can't be.

340
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,573
Okay.

341
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,177
For instance, I remember
when we first met...

342
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,480
...we had a great conversation.

343
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,818
I remember you said
I was the prettiest girl at the party.

344
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,323
But then after that we really talked,
didn't we?

345
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,361
Well, you told me how familiar
I looked...

346
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,524
...and that you must have seen me
somewhere before.

347
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,736
This relationship, it's got to be
about something.

348
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,641
And fast, or I am in very serious
and weird trouble.

349
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,806
- What else happened?
- You asked for a piece of gum...

350
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,951
...because you thought
your breath smelled like hummus.

351
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,818
All right. Yes. Gum.

352
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,546
Good enough. I'll take it.

353
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,588
- I like gum.
- I do too.

354
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,488
You see, that's what we're about.

355
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,859
You don't remind me of anyone
and we love gum.

356
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,627
- I have gum in my hair.
- I'm losing it.

357
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,443
Hey, you're Jerry's friend.
You're kooky. Mind if I sit?

358
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,602
My show is going well.
Have you seen it yet?

359
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,645
You should.
Everybody else in town has.

360
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,373
I got recognized the other day.

361
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,212
How weird is that? I know.
At first I liked the attention.

362
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,822
But after a while it's like, "Whoa, take
three steps back. Get a life," okay?

363
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,481
There wouldn't be a Sally Weaver
without the fans.

364
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,355
But who am I, anyway? I mean,
there's Sally Weaver the woman.

365
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,258
Sally Weaver the artist.
Sally Weaver-

366
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,262
You know, you've gotta shut up.

367
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,904
I'm sorry. I haven't spoken in days.

368
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,973
Well, lay it on me, string bean.

369
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,475
Let me get this gum out of my hair
and then I'll be ready for bed.

370
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,615
Okay, look, the gum
isn't cutting it for me.

371
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:55,947
We need to be about something else.
Anything. Please.

372
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,321
George.

373
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,120
- Your hair.
- Well, I had to cut the gum out...

374
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,059
...and I had a little trouble
getting it even.

375
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,422
So why don't you get undressed,
George?

376
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,331
George is in weird trouble.

377
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,807
You ripped off a "Ziggy"?

378
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,844
It must have seeped into
my subconscious.

379
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,778
Puddy has "Ziggy" bed sheets.

380
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,784
Did you read the comics today?

381
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,014
Oh, I see Ziggy's back
at the complaint department.

382
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,318
<i>" The New Yorker
is stealing my ideas."</i>

383
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,460
See, that's funny...

384
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,192
...because it's real.

385
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,130
Hey, lookit. Sally's cable show's on.

386
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,463
Hey, Kramer, come on in.
You gotta watch this.

387
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,867
This'll be funny.
Now, she's got nothing.

388
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,703
<i>Master of evil, Jerry Seinfeld,
broke off all contact with me.</i>

389
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,641
That's right, sister.
Why don't you just give up?

390
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,213
Why are you yelling at the TV?

391
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,440
<i>Okay, get this.</i>

392
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,642
<i>I heard he makes
his best friend date women...</i>

393
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,309
<i>...who look just like him.</i>

394
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,411
<i>Hello? Issues.</i>

395
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,284
Elaine, have you been talking
to her?

396
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,255
Hey, I'm just a fan.

397
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,792
<i>Oh, and speaking of issues...</i>

398
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,690
<i>...guess who got
a no-polish manicure...</i>

399
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,094
<i>...and begged his neighbor
not to tell anyone.</i>

400
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,064
I thought you stopped talking.

401
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,763
All right, starting now.

402
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,875
You broke up with her
because she cut her hair?

403
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,177
How short?

404
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,878
Like that.

405
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,450
- You mean like-?
- That.

406
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,117
- So she-
- Yes.

407
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,283
- And you don't -
- No.

408
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,396
- So.
- Exactly.

409
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,064
We must never ever speak
of this again.

410
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,261
No.

411
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,934
Hey, you wanna go see a movie?

412
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,806
Actually, I think I'm gonna take
a few days off.

413
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,074
- I think that's for the best.
- Yeah.
