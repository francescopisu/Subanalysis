1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,205
All right, be careful with the car, babe.
And don't move the seat.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,436
- Two and 10, babe.
- Okay.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,308
- Don't peel out.
- I won't.

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:24,217
<i>Jesus is one, Jesus is all</i>

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,919
<i>Jesus, pick me up when I fall</i>

6
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,360
<i>And he said unto Abraham-</i>

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,092
<i>Amen, amen</i>

8
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,326
<i>So we pray-</i>

9
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,492
<i>Faith-</i>

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,535
<i>Jesus-</i>

11
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,099
Jesus?

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,280
According to our latest
quarterly thing...

13
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,912
...Kruger Industrial Smoothing
is heading into the red.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,049
Or the black.
Or whatever the bad one is.

15
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,259
Any thoughts?

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,461
Well, I-
I know, when I'm a little strapped...

17
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:15,973
...I sometimes drop off my rent check
having "forgotten" to sign it.

18
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,734
That could buy us some time.

19
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,478
Works for me.
Good thinking, George.

20
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,310
- Good idea.
- All right, George. Way to go, man.

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,975
Or we don't even send the check...

22
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,521
...and then when they call,
we pretend we're the cleaning service.

23
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:36,462
"Hello? I'm sorry, no here Kruger."

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,086
Are you done?

25
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,665
Silly voices.
Come on, people, let's get real.

26
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,238
- Good one.
- That was bad.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,901
I had them, Jerry. They loved me.

28
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,513
- And then?
- I lost them.

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,914
I can usually come up with
one good comment during a meeting...

30
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,851
...but by the end, it's buried
under a pile of gaffes and bad puns.

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,612
Showmanship, George.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,760
When you hit that high note,
you say good night and walk off.

33
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,363
- I can't just leave.
- That's the way they do it in Vegas.

34
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,762
- You never played Vegas.
- I hear things.

35
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,834
Here's one.

36
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,303
I borrowed Puddy's car...

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:27,435
...and all the presets on his radio
were Christian rock stations.

38
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,876
I like Christian rock.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,881
It's very positive.

40
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:37,216
It's not like those real musicians
who think they're so cool and hip.

41
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,717
So you think that Puddy actually
believes in something?

42
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,864
Well, it's a used car. He probably
never changed the presets.

43
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,862
Yes. He is lazy.

44
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,898
He doesn't know
how to program the buttons.

45
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,798
Yes. He is dumb.

46
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,067
So you prefer dumb and lazy
to religious?

47
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,937
Dumb and lazy I understand.

48
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,642
I'll tell you how you could check.

49
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,304
Reprogram all the buttons,
see if he changes them back.

50
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,247
You know, the old switcheroo.

51
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,081
No, no, the old switcheroo
is you poison your drink...

52
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,849
...and then you switch it
with the other person's.

53
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,051
No, it's doing the same thing
to someone that they did to you.

54
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,255
Elaine's gonna do the same thing to
Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
- Well, that's the gist of it.
- Quiet!

56
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,930
- So where is this Sophie?
- She's picking me up in a few minutes.

57
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,770
- How long have you been together?
- I don't know. Since the last one.

58
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,909
Oh, here she is.
You wanna meet her?

59
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,120
By the way, how did Puddy
get back in the picture?

60
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,723
I-I needed to move a bureau.

61
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,022
Jerry, you got any pepper?

62
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,459
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mickey.

63
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,293
- Check the peppershaker.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,190
Mickey.

65
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,137
See? It should sound like that.
Something like that.

66
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,406
No, a little wetter.
See, I didn't believe it.

67
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,051
What's with the fake sneezing?

68
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,016
We're going down
to Mount Sinai Hospital.

69
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,453
See, they hire actors to help
the students practice diagnosing.

70
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,116
They assign you a disease
and you act out the symptoms.

71
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,092
- It's an easy gig.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,327
- Do medical schools actually do this?
- Well, the better ones.

73
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,233
All right,
let's practice retching, huh?

74
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,736
Ready?

75
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,973
I think the phone is ringing.

76
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,811
Would you hold it a second?

77
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,479
Thank you. Will you get out of here
with that stuff?

78
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,381
Mickey, D.T.'s, huh?

79
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,520
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

80
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,251
- Elaine?
- No. It's me.

81
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,361
George?

82
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,962
Jerry, it's Sophie.

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,431
I can't believe
you don't recognize my voice.

84
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,968
I knew it was you. I was joking.

85
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,197
I'm a comedian.

86
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,274
Hey, you got any ipecac?

87
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,905
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think
you guys are going too far with this.

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,016
- No. Mickey, he swallowed 12 aspirin.
- Did he overdose?

89
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,550
No, it's just too much.

90
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,855
And it gets worse.

91
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,821
The team working on the statue
in Lafayette Square...

92
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,961
...kind of over-smoothed it.

93
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,087
They ground the head down
to about the size of a softball.

94
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,563
And that spells trouble.

95
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,367
Why don't we smooth the head
down to nothing...

96
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,096
...stick a pumpkin under its arm...

97
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,833
...and change the nameplate
to Ichabod Crane?

98
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,373
All right. That's it for me.

99
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,245
Good night, everybody.

100
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,849
In your packets you will find
the disease you have been assigned...

101
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,586
...and the symptoms
you will need to exhibit.

102
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,992
Bacterial meningitis.

103
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,859
Jackpot!

104
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,293
Gonorrhea?

105
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,009
- You wanna trade?
- Sorry, buddy.

106
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,146
<i>This is the Hamlet of diseases.</i>

107
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,045
Severe pain, nausea, delusions,
it's got everything.

108
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,617
How about you? You wanna trade?

109
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,084
- Sure.
- Okay, what do you got?

110
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,951
The surgeon left a sponge
inside me.

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,921
Good luck with that.

112
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,963
I knew I had hit my high note, so I-

113
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,658
I thanked the crowd and I was gone.

114
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,262
<i>- What'd you do the rest of the day?
- I saw Titanic.</i>

115
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,298
So that old woman...

116
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,477
...she's just a liar, right?

117
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,135
And a bit of a tramp, if you ask me.

118
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,146
- Hello, boys.
- Hey.

119
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,180
Did you give that radio
the old switcheroo?

120
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,546
- I did.
- And the Christian rock?

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,052
Resurrected.

122
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,024
And look what I pried
off of his bumper.

123
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,526
A Jesus fish.

124
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,489
Jerry, you have any fish sticks?

125
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,328
No.

126
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,735
So you're disappointed
he's a spiritual person?

127
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,204
Well, yeah. I got him because
he seemed so one-dimensional.

128
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,468
I feel misled.

129
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,202
I think it's neat.

130
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,973
You don't hear that much
about God anymore.

131
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,343
I hear things.

132
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,284
So Sophie gave me the "it's me"
on the phone today.

133
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,415
- "It's me"? Isn't that a little premature?
- I thought so.

134
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,426
She's not a "me." I'm a "me."

135
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:48,397
I'm against all "it's me's".
So self-absorbed and egotistical.

136
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,026
It's like those hip musicians
with their complicated shoes.

137
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,369
Well, I got gonorrhea.

138
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,782
That seems about right.

139
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,682
That's what they gave me.

140
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,856
They?

141
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,023
- The government?
- No, no.

142
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,892
He's pretending he's got gonorrhea
so med students can diagnose it.

143
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,331
And it's a waste of my talent.
It's just a little burning.

144
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,195
Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
You know, that's...

145
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,968
Well, I guess there are no
small diseases, only small actors.

146
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,235
Yeah.

147
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,711
All right, that's it for me.

148
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,680
Good night, everybody.

149
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,650
What was that? What was that?

150
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,289
Showmanship. George is trying
to get out on a high note.

151
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,756
See, showmanship. Maybe that's
what my gonorrhea's missing, huh?

152
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,886
Yes. Step into that spotlight and belt
that gonorrhea out to the back row.

153
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,157
Yes. Yes, I will.

154
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,995
I'm gonna make people
feel my gonorrhea...

155
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,831
...and feel the gonorrhea
in themselves.

156
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,071
And are you experiencing
any discomfort?

157
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,840
Oh, just a little burning
during urination.

158
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,382
Okay. Any other pain?

159
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,716
The haunting memories of lost love.

160
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,881
May I? Lights.

161
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,466
Our eyes met
across the crowded hat store.

162
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:38,304
I, a customer, and she,
a coquettish haberdasher.

163
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,439
I pursued and she withdrew.

164
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,981
And then she pursued
and I withdrew.

165
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,783
And so we danced.

166
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,487
And I burned for her...

167
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,181
...much like the burning
during urination...

168
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,919
...that I would experience
soon afterwards.

169
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,825
- Gonorrhea.
- Gonorrhea.

170
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,597
One message.
Hope it's not from you.

171
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,066
<i>Hey, Jerry, it's me. Call me back.</i>

172
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,507
- Sophie.
- She's still doing that?

173
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,113
- Yep.
- All right, I'll tell you what you do.

174
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,614
You call her back
and give her the "it's me," huh?

175
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,479
Pull the old switcheroo.

176
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,818
That's the " what's good for the goose
is good for the gander."

177
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,924
What the hell is a gander, anyway?

178
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,122
It's a goose that's had
the old switcheroo pulled on her.

179
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,989
Hi, Sophie. It's me.

180
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,626
Hey, Rafe.

181
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,101
- She thinks it's someone named Rafe.
- Good, good. Let her think it.

182
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,004
So, what's going on?

183
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,040
Not a lot.

184
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,840
Ask about you. Ask about you.

185
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,611
So how are things with Jerry?

186
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,113
Oh, I really like him...

187
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,314
...but, well, I still haven't told him
the tractor story.

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,723
Right, right, the tractor story.

189
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,229
Are you sick, Rafe?
You sound kind of funny.

190
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,163
- I sound funny?
- Abort. Abort.

191
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,561
Yeah, I better get to a doctor. Bye.

192
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,775
That was close.

193
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,003
What drives me
to take chances like that?

194
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,238
That was very real.

195
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,407
She said there's some tractor story
that she hasn't told me about.

196
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,212
Back it up, back it up.

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,687
Tractor story?

198
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,087
What are you doing?

199
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,099
- So where do you wanna eat?
- Feels like an Arby's night.

200
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:52,374
Arby's. Beef and cheese and...
Do you believe in God?

201
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,569
Yes.

202
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,977
- So you're pretty religious?
- That's right.

203
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,250
So is it a problem
that I'm not really religious?

204
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,683
Not for me.

205
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,416
- Why not?
- I'm not the one going to hell.

206
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,607
You know what I think?
I bet she stole a tractor.

207
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,711
No one's stealing a tractor.
It's a five-mile-an-hour getaway.

208
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,274
We're dancing around the obvious.
It's gotta be disfigurement.

209
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,777
Does she walk around holding a pen
she never seems to need?

210
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,888
No, she looks completely normal.

211
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,852
Okay. Here it is. I got it.

212
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,858
She lost her thumbs
in a tractor accident...

213
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,260
...and they grafted her big toes on.

214
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,166
They do it every day.

215
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,138
You think she's got toes for thumbs?

216
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,872
How's her handshake?

217
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,873
Little firm, isn't it?

218
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,808
- Maybe a little too firm?
- I don't know.

219
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,145
Hands a little smelly?

220
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,686
Why do I seek your counsel?

221
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,647
- Well, I'm going to hell.
- That seems about right.

222
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,315
According to Puddy.

223
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,394
Have you heard the one about the guy
with coffee and doughnuts-?

224
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,124
- I'm not in the mood.
- I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.

225
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,001
What do you care?
You don't believe in hell.

226
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,660
I know, but he does.

227
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,467
So it's more of a relationship problem
than the final destination of your soul?

228
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,202
Well, relationships
are very important to me.

229
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,938
Maybe you can strike one up
with the Prince of Darkness...

230
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,139
...as you burn for all eternity.

231
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,174
And a slice of devil's food cake.

232
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,088
Hey.

233
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,422
- Where is everyone?
- They're all off the project.

234
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:57,126
They were boring.
George, you are my main man.

235
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,525
I am?

236
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,605
I don't know what it is.
I can't put my finger on it.

237
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,232
But lately, you have just seemed on.

238
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,347
And you always leave me
wanting more.

239
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,545
This is a huge project involving...

240
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,689
...lots of numbers and papers
and folders.

241
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,224
I'm not too worried about it.
Let's get started.

242
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,022
Okay.

243
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,663
- George. Check it out.
- Yeah?

244
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,797
Three times around with no feet.

245
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,062
All me.

246
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,904
All me.

247
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,043
All right. And here are your ailments
for this week.

248
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,736
By the way, Mr. Kramer,
you were excellent.

249
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,211
Thank you.

250
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,612
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice.

251
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,082
All right, I get to wear makeup.

252
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,280
- What did you get?
- Gonorrhea.

253
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,588
Excuse me,
I think there's been a mistake.

254
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,124
See, I had gonorrhea last week.

255
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,263
Oh, it's no mistake.
We loved what you did with it.

256
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,460
Boy, I don't believe this.
I'm being typecast.

257
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,041
I move my knight here.

258
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,266
Check.

259
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,540
They should update these pieces.
Nobody rides horses anymore.

260
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,946
Maybe they should change it
to a tractor.

261
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,744
Jerry, are you embarrassed
that you're losing?

262
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,287
Losing?

263
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,654
You know, yesterday I lost control
of my car, almost bought the farm.

264
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,092
Bought the farm?

265
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,824
Tractor.

266
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,463
This is an odd side of you, Jerry.

267
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,736
I feel uncomfortable.

268
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,297
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb-wrestle.

269
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,607
A scar?

270
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,843
A big long scar, where her leg
would dangle when she's riding a-

271
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,111
A tractor.

272
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,586
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious
and doesn't like to talk about it.

273
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,658
She's more self-conscious about that
than her toe-thumbs.

274
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,954
She doesn't have toe-thumbs.

275
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,630
- She will if she keeps horsing around-
- All right.

276
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,599
So how's the two-man operation
at Kruger?

277
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,206
Two-man. It's all me.
Kruger doesn't do anything.

278
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,969
Disappears for hours at a time,
gives me fake excuses.

279
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,011
This afternoon, I found him
with sleep creases on his face.

280
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,675
The only reason I got out
to get a bite today...

281
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,013
...was that he finally promised to
buckle down and do some actual work.

282
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,620
Oh, I don't believe this.

283
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,724
This is what I have to put up with,
Jerry.

284
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,063
Mr. Kruger.

285
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,031
Who said he was going to do
some actual work today?

286
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,728
- Who?
- I'm not too worried about it.

287
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,106
Well, I am.

288
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,835
Couldn't you try to go through some
of that stuff I put in your shoebox?

289
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,503
All right, all right, I'm going.

290
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,044
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

291
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,214
Never.

292
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,456
Elaine, they forgot to deliver
your paper today.

293
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,423
- Why don't you just grab that one?
- But that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy.

294
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,329
- That's his.
- Come on, get it.

295
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,867
- Well, if you want it, you get it.
- Sorry, thou shalt not steal.

296
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,905
Oh, but it's okay for me?

297
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,412
Oh, what do you care?
You know where you're going.

298
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,844
All right, that is it.
I can't live like this.

299
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,577
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

300
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,517
All right, what did I do?

301
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,752
David, I'm going to hell.

302
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,917
The worst place in the world.

303
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,998
With devils and those caves
and the ragged clothing.

304
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,364
And the heat, my God, the heat!

305
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,938
- What do you think about all that?
- It's gonna be rough.

306
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,807
- You should be trying to save me.
- Don't boss me.

307
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,571
- This is why you're going to hell.
- I am not going to hell.

308
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,183
And if you think I'm going to hell,
you should care that I'm going to hell...

309
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,783
...even though I am not.

310
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,724
- You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

311
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,899
My liver. Why did I drink
for all those years?

312
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,868
Why did I look for love in a bottle?

313
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,496
Mr. Kramer, you're up.

314
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,505
Oh, hey, Mickey.

315
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,768
- Wait a minute.
- What?

316
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,243
- You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
- Yeah, well, we'll see.

317
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,816
So, what seems to be bothering you
today, Mr. Kramer?

318
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,078
Well, I-

319
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:46,918
I guess it started about 20 years ago
when I got back from Vietnam.

320
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,118
And this was the only friend
I had left.

321
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,322
Hey! That's my cirrhosis!
He's stealing my cirrhosis!

322
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,799
You wanna be sick?
I'll make you sick!

323
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,830
Cirrhosis of the liver
and PCP addiction?

324
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,803
Let me see if I understand this.

325
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,716
You're concerned that he isn't
concerned that you're going to hell.

326
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,852
And you feel that she's too bossy.

327
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,685
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, that's right.

328
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,420
Well, oftentimes,
in cases of interfaith marriages...

329
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,321
...couples have difficulty-

330
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,687
No one's getting married here.

331
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,694
- You aren't?
- No.

332
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,625
We're just, you know...

333
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,826
...having a good time.

334
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,071
Well, then it's simple.
You're both going to hell.

335
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,837
No way. This is bogus, man.

336
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,715
Well, thank you, Father.

337
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,209
Did you hear the one
about the guy in hell...

338
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,719
...who's talking to the devil
by the coffee machine?

339
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,380
I'm really not in the mood.
I'm going to hell.

340
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,125
Lighten up.

341
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,855
It'll only feel like an eternity.

342
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,773
You know, Jerry, there's this thing
that I haven't told you about.

343
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:15,812
See, there was this tractor, and...

344
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,573
You know, boy, this is-
This is really difficult.

345
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,343
Sophie...

346
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,919
...it's me.

347
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,584
I know about the tractor story
and I'm fine with it.

348
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,591
How could you know?

349
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,689
It's not important.

350
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,995
What's important is I'm not gonna
let a little thing like that...

351
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:44,438
...ruin what could be a very long-term
and meaningful relationship.

352
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,442
I didn't say that, no.

353
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,671
You gave me gonorrhea,
you didn't even tell me!

354
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,109
Well, I'm sorry.

355
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,843
I gave you gonorrhea because
I thought you'd have fun with it.

356
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,214
Hey, hey, I'm with someone.

357
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,055
Hello.

358
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,324
No, I understand. This could be
a tough thing to deal with.

359
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,124
The important thing is that you have
a partner who's supportive.

360
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,800
You know, she's right.

361
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,801
Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner.
I got gonorrhea from a tractor.

362
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,767
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?

363
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,743
And you call that the tractor story?

364
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,939
You can't get it from that.

365
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,176
But I did. My boyfriend said
I got gonorrhea...

366
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,946
...from riding the tractor
in my bathing suit.

367
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,421
All right, that's it for me.
You've been great.

368
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,617
Good night, everybody.

369
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,447
Would you mind helping me out
with some of this stuff?

370
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,145
You seem like you've got
a good handle on it.

371
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,984
No, I don't!

372
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,059
Don't you even care?
This is your company.

373
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,196
It's your name
on the outside of the building.

374
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,824
Speaking of which, the R fell off
and all it says now is "K-uger."

375
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,800
K- uger. That sounds like
one of those old-time car horns, huh?

376
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,405
K- uger! K-uger!

377
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,542
You are too much, Mr. Kruger.
Too much.

378
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,683
Thank you, George.
You've been great. That's it for me.

379
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,683
Oh, no, you're not going out
on a high note with me, Mr. Kruger.

380
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,582
It's K-uger.

381
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,922
No! No!

382
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,582
Good night, everybody.
