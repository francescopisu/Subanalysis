1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,567
- If you borrow my blender, return it.
- Come on, we're like Cain and Abel.

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,710
Yeah, you know, Cain slew Abel.

3
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,277
No, he didn't.
They were in business together.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,572
Dry wall or something.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,046
- Oh, no.
- All right, then what was it?

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,209
Well, I think Abel worked hard
all summer harvesting his crops...

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,981
...while Cain just played in the field.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:27,354
Then when winter came, Abel had
all the nuts, Cain had no nuts.

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,755
So he killed him.

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,590
The way I remember it, Cain,
he was a successful doctor...

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,701
...but when he took this
special formula, he became Mr. Abel.

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,766
You broke my blender.

13
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,599
Yeah. Well, I was trying
to make gravel and it just-

14
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,210
- It just didn't work out.
- I knew it.

15
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,171
Why were you making gravel?

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,579
Well, I like the sound it makes
when you walk on it.

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,416
This looks familiar.

18
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,918
Of course, it's garbage.

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,057
No, no, no, no. These brown things.

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,953
And the chairs.

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,061
<i>Jerry, this is the set
from the old Merv Griffin Show.</i>

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,459
They must be throwing it out.

23
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,793
This stuff belongs
in the Smithsonian.

24
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,492
Or at least in the dumpster
behind the Smithsonian.

25
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,335
Boy, one minute Elliott Gould
is sitting on you...

26
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,806
...and the next thing
you're yesterday's trash.

27
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,274
Come on, get out of there.

28
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,643
Oh, no, you go ahead.
I'm not finished taking this in.

29
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,447
Jerry, look.

30
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,744
Merv Griffin's cigar.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,456
You know, I spilled a yogurt smoothie
in here two days ago.

32
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,094
Can't smell anything, can you?

33
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,456
Banana?

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,458
Right.

35
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,293
George, watch out
for those pigeons.

36
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,494
Oh, they'll get out of the way.
You really smell banana?

37
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,866
Oh, my God.

38
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,610
So...

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,739
...where we eating?

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,983
And it was his idea to put
a sprig of parsley on the plate.

41
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:05,147
You're making this up.
There was never a Joseph Garnish.

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,327
Oh, yeah. The toys.

43
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,156
Where did you get all these?

44
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,763
My dad was a collector.

45
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,196
I inherited them after he died
from a long painful bout with-

46
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,733
SuperBall.

47
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,964
Hey, an original G.I. Joe...

48
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,975
...with the full frogman suit.

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,134
What are you doing?

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,837
I'm putting this on him
and we're going to the sink.

51
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,676
No, Jerry...

52
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,442
...they're priceless.

53
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,314
They've never been played with.

54
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,287
- I just wanna touch them a little.
- I said, no.

55
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,858
Now, come here.

56
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,736
Hi.

57
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,138
I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.

58
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,042
Hey, Walter.
What is the deal with that guy?

59
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,046
He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.

60
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,950
Hey, your coffee stain looks like
Fidel Castro.

61
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,050
You've been an enormous help.

62
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,251
You ran over some pigeons?
How many?

63
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,260
Whatever they had.

64
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,925
Miranda thinks I'm a butcher.
But it's not my fault, is it?

65
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,729
Don't we have a deal
with the pigeons?

66
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,665
Of course we have a deal.

67
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,431
They get out of the way of cars...

68
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,133
...we look the other way
on the statue defecation.

69
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,802
Right. And these pigeons
broke the deal.

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,244
I will not accept the blame for this.

71
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,710
- So Miranda's cooled on you?
- I'm getting nothing.

72
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,375
Yeah, me neither.

73
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,317
I thought you were sleeping together.

74
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,117
Oh, the sex is wild,
but she's got this toy collection...

75
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,089
...and she won't let me near it.

76
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,428
I don't understand women.

77
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,586
Here comes one.

78
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,723
Hey. What's going on?

79
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,830
Hey. Art Garfunkel?

80
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,939
- No, Castro.
- Right.

81
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,837
It's all because of this
creepy new guy at work.

82
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,275
He just comes out of nowhere
and he's right next to you.

83
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,641
So he just sidles up?

84
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:13,047
That's right. He's a real sidler.

85
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,148
- Maybe you didn't see him.
- You never see him.

86
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,983
He sidled me again in my office.

87
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,784
I was sitting making Cup-a-Soup...

88
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,154
<i>...singing that song
from The Lion King.</i>

89
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,989
"Hakuna Matata"?

90
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,464
- I thought I was alone.
- That doesn't make it right.

91
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,265
To me, the Hakuna Matata
is not nearly as embarrassing...

92
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,703
- ...as the Cup-a-Soup.
- Would you just...

93
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,899
...let it go?

94
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,840
Hey, Jerry. Come here a sec.

95
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,774
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,438
Hey.

97
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,208
Oh, my God.

98
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,218
<i>It's the Merv Griffin set.</i>

99
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,448
How did you get this in here?

100
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,685
Oh, you just bring it in sideways
and hook it.

101
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,029
- So where are you gonna sleep?
- Backstage.

102
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,600
This chair smells like garbage.

103
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,432
A lot of the stars from the '70s...

104
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,370
...they were not as hygienic
as they appeared on TV.

105
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,375
You take Mannix, for example.

106
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,701
I'm gonna get that.

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,644
Well, Jerry we'd love
to have you back any time.

108
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,518
Well, Elaine Benes...

109
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,918
Well, it's great to have you.

110
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,820
Is it possible
you're even more beautiful...

111
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,654
...than the last time I saw you?

112
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,609
We had a deal.

113
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,516
- Mr. Peterman, here are these pages-
- One moment.

114
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,517
I'm reading
the fascinating article...

115
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,521
...on the most fascinating people
of the year.

116
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,183
And done.

117
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,388
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, I needed this so quickly.

118
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,625
It must have been a lot of work.
Thank you very much, you two.

119
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,769
What?

120
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,602
Three dates and she still
won't let me play with the toys.

121
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,038
That's interesting.

122
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,475
Someone mentioned to me
you were not very happy...

123
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,409
...with your toys growing up.

124
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,073
Yeah, that was me.

125
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,741
That's right, right.

126
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,480
And you mentioned that you didn't get
a G.I. Joe. You had...

127
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,090
- An Army Pete.
- Right.

128
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,387
He was made of wood, in the rain
he would swell up and then split.

129
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,332
And we all know
how painful that can be.

130
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,130
- Jerry? Oh, there you are.
- Oh, Elaine Benes.

131
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,434
Well, this is quite a thrill.
Yes, come.

132
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,510
Yes, sit down. Yes.

133
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,082
Well, I'll tell you, this sidler guy
is really chapping my hide.

134
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,241
Excuse me?

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,184
Yeah, we're talking this way.

136
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,523
He's getting credit
for work that I did.

137
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,818
He's gonna sidle me
right out of a job.

138
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:12,192
Now, for those of us who don't know,
sidling is what?

139
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,628
Kramer, what is wrong with you?

140
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,358
What do you mean?

141
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,971
Well, for starters,
you're looking at note cards.

142
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,032
I'm gonna give that guy
a taste of his own medicine.

143
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,475
So I am going to sidle the sidler.

144
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,606
You sidle? You stomp around
like a Clydesdale.

145
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,081
Not with these honeys.

146
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,152
Wrestling shoes.

147
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,256
Only in New York.

148
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,651
Jerry?

149
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,199
Hey. Well, ladies and gentlemen.

150
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,460
It's our good friend,
George Costanza.

151
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,695
What a surprise.

152
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,974
<i>Turn music off.</i>

153
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,239
Yeah, sit, sit.

154
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,011
- Well, it happened again.
- What happened?

155
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,081
I'll ask the questions.

156
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,725
What happened?

157
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,525
Well, I just stomped some pigeons
in the park. They didn't move.

158
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,158
All right. Let's change the subject.

159
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,864
Now, you and Jerry dated for a while.
Tell us...

160
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,837
...what was that like?

161
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,447
It's the wrong card.

162
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,811
I don't get these birds.
They're breaking the deal.

163
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,284
It's like the pigeons decided
to ignore me.

164
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,922
So they're like everyone else.

165
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,857
All right, let's take a short break.

166
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,903
Okay, we're back.

167
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,079
Boy, that bank clock
is eight minutes off.

168
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,776
Then why don't you just
run it over too?

169
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,161
George, what are you doing?

170
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,433
Did you see that?
That pigeon didn't move.

171
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,400
I had to swerve out of the way.
I saved that pigeon's life.

172
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,975
What pigeon?
You drove right into that squirrel.

173
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,200
Squirrel?

174
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,108
Well, we have no deal with them.

175
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,853
Jerry, those hands. They never stop.

176
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,621
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,426
You got any booze?
What say you and I get ripped.

178
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,834
No, thanks. I have a headache.

179
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,802
Can you just get me an aspirin?

180
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,799
All right.

181
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,942
"Will not cause drowsiness."

182
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,880
"May cause drowsiness."

183
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,484
Here's the new copy you wanted.

184
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,493
Oh, yes.

185
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,967
Well, this certainly looks like
a lot of words in record time.

186
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,367
I'm very impressed with both of you.

187
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,038
Thank you.

188
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,113
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted.

189
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,841
This is incoherent drivel.

190
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,053
This is a total redo...

191
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,418
...and I'm assuming I need it
right away.

192
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,890
Well, I guess we'll just have-

193
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,822
Oh, just give me that.

194
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,378
Mission accomplished.
Back to base, Joe.

195
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,683
Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?

196
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,484
There's been massive trauma.
We could, of course, try to save him...

197
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,026
...but it would be costly, difficult,
and we'd have to send away...

198
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,596
...for some special,
really tiny instruments.

199
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,632
Well, are there any other options?

200
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,532
We could put him to sleep.

201
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,437
What might that cost?

202
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,636
Well, it's by the pound,
so about 80 cents.

203
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,005
- Well...
- George.

204
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,374
I was just- I was curious, that's all.

205
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,419
We'd like you to do
everything possible.

206
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,055
He's not gonna be the same,
you know?

207
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,453
Yeah, yeah, I know.

208
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,627
So they're flying
the tiny instruments in from El Paso.

209
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:15,031
El Paso.
I spent a month there one night.

210
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,503
El Paso.

211
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,304
What's he here for?

212
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,204
Well, he takes some of the pressure
off of me.

213
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,037
So, Jerry what's going on with you?

214
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,648
I understand there's a young lady
in your life.

215
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,307
Actually, it's kind of a funny story,
because she has this toy collection...

216
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,454
...and last night,
I got to play with them.

217
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,021
Well, sounds like things
are progressing.

218
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,487
Do I hear wedding bells?

219
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,149
- Are you married right now?
- Newman.

220
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,989
She doesn't even know
about the toys.

221
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:48,759
I gave her the wrong kind of medicine
and I guess she passed out.

222
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,663
What do you mean, wrong kind?

223
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,895
She's got that Mattel
football game we loved.

224
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,471
You gotta get me over there.

225
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,302
Wait a minute. You mean
to say that you drugged a woman...

226
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,411
...so you could take advantage
of her toys?

227
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,013
Let's pause a moment.

228
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,375
Jerry...

229
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,112
...what you do with your
personal life is your business.

230
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,121
But when you're on my set,
you clean it up, mister.

231
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,855
I told you he was a risk.

232
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,893
Oh, like he's not just carrying you,
and has been for years.

233
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,156
Yeah, well, you bombed. That story
stunk worse than these chairs.

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,696
Smile, everyone. We're back.

235
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,396
- You wanted to see me, Elaine?
- Yes, Lou.

236
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,536
You've got a lot going for you.

237
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,508
You're spontaneous.

238
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,978
You're symmetrical.

239
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,885
You're very quick, aren't you?

240
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,214
It's just that you're:

241
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,091
My dead tooth?

242
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,096
No.

243
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,192
You're:

244
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,690
What, my breath?

245
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,493
What can I do?

246
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:04,166
Well, you should never, ever
go anywhere without these.

247
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,005
Thanks, Elaine.
You're such a super lady.

248
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,717
More wine and turkey?

249
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,520
So when I saw George with an
18-pound turkey and a box of wine...

250
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,531
...I thought, "What a coincidence,
we're just about to eat."

251
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,561
What is that stuff in turkey
that makes you sleepy?

252
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,897
- Tryptophan.
- Tryptophan.

253
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,367
I think.

254
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,634
Have some more wine.

255
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,242
What video did you get?

256
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,609
Oh, George brought home movies
of his boyhood trip to Michigan.

257
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,711
Four hours.

258
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,479
More heavy gravy?

259
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:54,088
Yes. Touchdown. Your turn, Jerry.

260
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,727
Lately though, I've been buying
the generic brand of wax beans.

261
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,401
You know, I rip off the label...

262
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,804
...I can hardly tell the difference.

263
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,245
We've officially bottomed out.

264
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,111
- Who's our next guest?
- We got no one.

265
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,613
We need a new format.
We should shut down and retool.

266
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,767
- What about a guest host?
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

267
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,834
- Doctor, how's the squirrel?
- Is he dead?

268
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,416
No, fortunately the special
tiny instruments arrived just in time.

269
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,610
- Would you like to visit him?
- Yes, he would.

270
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,127
You have 30 minutes.

271
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,870
So...

272
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,773
...squirrel.

273
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,943
One more thing, Mr. Costanza.

274
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,673
We just need to know what time
you'll be picking him up tomorrow.

275
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,009
What's that?

276
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,245
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel.
We think he'll be better off at home.

277
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,213
He has no home. He's a squirrel.

278
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,519
Your home, Mr. Costanza.

279
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,161
Just make sure he gets his medicine
six times a day...

280
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,559
...and keep his tail elevated.

281
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,830
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.

282
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,438
It's not a pet. It's a wild invalid.

283
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,841
And it knows that I tried to kill it.

284
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,946
As soon as it gets better, it's gonna
gnaw my brain out in my sleep.

285
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,244
Jerry. Hey.
What are you doing tomorrow?

286
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,409
- I want you to come by.
- What about my questionable material?

287
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,851
No, we got a whole new format.
Edgy, youthful.

288
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,424
- Plus, we got Jim Fowler.
- Jim Fowler?

289
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,891
The animal guy from Wild Kingdom
is coming?

290
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,122
Well, I practically raised his kids.

291
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,328
Perfect, a zoo guy.
He takes care of animals.

292
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,799
Can I bring the squirrel by?

293
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,771
Two animal acts on the same show?

294
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,930
Is this amateur hour?

295
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,600
Look, George, I'm sorry,
maybe another time, all right?

296
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,170
I gotta get to Fowler.

297
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,008
I know he would take this squirrel.

298
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,742
- It's practically bionic.
- Hey.

299
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,885
Nice sidle, huh?

300
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,786
Speaking of which,
I think I've got that problem solved.

301
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,982
Tic Tacs work?

302
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,492
He's a human maraca.

303
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,226
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped
from that football game.

304
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,299
You took him over to Celia's?

305
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,060
What? It's a victimless crime.

306
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,936
What about the woman who's been
drugged and taken advantage of?

307
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,938
Okay, one victim.

308
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,238
I think it's unconscionable.

309
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,938
Last night, I found a whole Weeble
village behind the Easy-Bake Oven.

310
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,173
Easy-Bake Oven?

311
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,515
Who wants a cupcake?

312
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,914
Me, me, me, me, me.

313
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,413
You know that batter is like
30 years old.

314
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,286
<i>You step on it and it flushes.</i>

315
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,759
Why is your father giving a tour
of a rest stop?

316
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,297
<i>- Stop squirming.
- Don't. This is where they change me.</i>

317
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,128
<i>- You're like 8 years old.
- Georgie.</i>

318
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,770
I was 7 and a half.

319
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,377
That noise.

320
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,877
- That's the noise.
- What?

321
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,243
That infernal rattling
that has plagued me...

322
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,409
...these past two days,
and I could not find the source.

323
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,078
In my office, in the hallway...

324
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,350
...even in the men's room.
Shame on you, Elaine.

325
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,494
No, no, Mr. Peterman.
That wasn't me.

326
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,028
That reminds me of
the Haitian voodoo rattle torture.

327
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,661
You haven't gone over to their side,
have you?

328
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,959
No, Mr. Peterman.

329
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,802
Because if I hear one more rattle,
just one, you're out on your can.

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,608
And if you are undead...

331
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,714
...I'll find out about that too.

332
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,824
Lou. In here.

333
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,422
We have to talk.

334
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,569
- Oh, right.
- Stop it.

335
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,999
Bad voodoo.

336
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,572
- You've gotta stop using these.
- Why?

337
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,101
Because they're turning
your teeth green.

338
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,006
I only buy the white ones.

339
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,375
Okay. Well, then your teeth
are green for a different reason.

340
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,178
You gotta stop carrying these, okay?
Just use mouthwash.

341
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,912
I can't. It burns my cankers.

342
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,845
Binaca.

343
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,652
- Again.
- Right, right, cankers.

344
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,260
- I got it. Chew gum.
- I hate gum.

345
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,364
The only gum I liked came with
the Mickey Mouse gumball machine.

346
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,397
They stopped making that
20 years ago.

347
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,634
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.

348
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,972
Okay, a little later we're gonna be
talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.

349
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,079
Where are the cameras?

350
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,050
But first, we're talking with Jerry.

351
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,114
Hey, Jerry...

352
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,951
...you drugged a woman
in order to play with her toy collection.

353
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,820
How do you feel about that?

354
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,986
It was great. I've done it
a few more times since then.

355
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,724
And she doesn't know
anything about this?

356
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,162
No. Not a thing.

357
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,499
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise
for you. Come on out, Celia.

358
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,668
What kind of sick, twisted creep
are you?

359
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,970
What is this?
What is she doing here?

360
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,082
What? It's the new format.
Scandals and animals.

361
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,244
If you think you can drug me and play,
you've got another thing coming.

362
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,252
Go, girl.

363
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,950
Well, what kind of woman
drinks an entire box of wine?

364
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:08,428
Mr. Fowler, I have a squirrel here
that is a miracle of modern science.

365
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,033
I told you, we're booked.

366
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,830
Careful. Hawks and squirrels
don't get along together.

367
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,504
Another interesting confrontation.
This could be spicy, bring him over.

368
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,200
No, you idiot. Hawks eat squirrels.

369
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,121
Are we getting this?

370
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,490
So the whole set was destroyed?

371
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,120
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying
and the hawk kept clawing.

372
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,894
Well, at least we know that
prosthetic squirrel hips work.

373
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,266
Sorry about the set.

374
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,805
I'll tell you, it was a grind
having to fill 10 hours a day.

375
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,502
I'm not sure I was ready
to have my own talk show set.

376
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,708
I got the nut bread, George.
Let's go.

377
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,518
So the squirrel's gonna make it?

378
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,847
Yeah, he's in my bed.

379
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,014
I'm sleeping on the couch.

380
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,158
On the couch? So you're-

381
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,486
Still getting nothing.

382
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,692
Oh, go ahead, pigeons. Laugh it up.

383
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:21,165
I'm getting in my car now,
and the last I heard, we have no deal.

384
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,443
I'm glad you called, Elaine.
I really needed to talk to someone.

385
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,603
Oh, well, hey, I dated Jerry too.
I know what a monster he can be.

386
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,510
More wine and turkey?

387
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,052
- Who's he?
- Oh, he's nobody.

388
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,383
Hey, listen,
let me top that off for you.
