1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,302
- Man, I'm starving.
- How can you be hungry...

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,500
...after what you ate
at that Mets game?

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,168
Because ballpark food
doesn't count as real food.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,643
Right. It's just an activity.

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,941
Like that paddle
with the ball and rubber band.

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,348
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano
made a fortune off of those.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,455
See, he came up with the idea
for the rubber band.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,683
Before that, people would just
hit the ball and it would fly away.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,363
I can't believe you made me leave
before the end of the game.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,056
Oh, come on, Jerry,
it was nine to nothing.

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,327
We were getting shellacked.

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,095
Those nachos are killing me.

13
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,471
I thought you were hungry.

14
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,235
It's complicated.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,470
- Jerry, you're gonna miss the exit.
- Keep your shirt on, I got it.

16
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,944
Watch out for that maroon Golf.

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,540
Look at this guy.
He's trying to box me out.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,752
I'll tell you when you can go.
Wait, wait, wait.

19
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,685
Now, now, now.
No, no, no.

20
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,655
Now. Go, go. No, no. Wait.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,058
Wait. Now, now, now. Jerry, go-

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,661
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf.

23
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,895
He thinks I cut him off.
He accelerated.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,939
You want me to moon him?
Let's moon him.

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,669
Roll up your window.
Let's do a pressed ham under glass.

26
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,176
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

27
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,473
Look at this, look.
He's giving us the finger.

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,844
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

29
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,580
<i>So I saw that new movie
about the Hindenberg.</i>

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,157
Oh, yeah, what's that called?

31
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,294
<i>Blimp: The Hindenberg Story.</i>

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,226
- How was it?
- I found it morose.

33
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,593
Why dwell on
these negative themes?

34
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,203
<i>They should make a movie about all
the Hindenberg flights that made it.</i>

35
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,667
Anyway, right in the middle,
the ship blows up.

36
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,809
Burning debris, bodies falling...

37
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:54,140
...and then just as this eerie silence
settles over the airfield...

38
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,112
...I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt."

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,377
The place went nuts.

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,383
Imagine the laugh
you could have gotten...

41
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,920
...if you had yelled that out
at the actual disaster.

42
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,757
Yeah.

43
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,724
Why are we slowing down?

44
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,919
What is that music?

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,557
What's with all these flags?

46
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,856
Oh, no.

47
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,231
- It's the Puerto Rican Day parade.
- It's the Puerto Rican Day parade.

48
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,931
The city shuts down Fifth Avenue.
They never let anyone through.

49
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,542
We are never getting home.

50
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,176
I'll check it out.

51
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,547
Yep.

52
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,918
Yep, the streets are all blocked.

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,526
I think every Puerto Rican in the world
is out here.

54
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,356
Well, it is our day.

55
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,894
Wrong car. Sorry.

56
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,059
<i>And the Mets score two
in the eighth inning.</i>

57
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,671
See? If we had stayed,
we could have seen those runs.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,967
I could've had some ice cream.

59
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,736
That might have calmed down
the nachos.

60
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,881
<i>I'm gonna miss 60 Minutes.
You know I hate to miss 60 Minutes.</i>

61
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,676
It's part of my Sunday
weekend wind-down.

62
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,819
How you can unwind
with that clock ticking?

63
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,078
It makes me anxious.

64
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,856
All right, gentlemen. I scouted it out.
I think we can get out over there.

65
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,688
But that's a one-way street
coming this way.

66
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,625
Besides, how am I gonna get
over there?

67
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,731
Just inch over.
You worm your way.

68
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,197
Just do it, Jerry.

69
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,962
This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.

70
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,629
You know,
you should make yourself throw up.

71
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,934
You know you're going to.

72
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,043
All right, I'm worming.

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,045
Hey, Jerry. You know who
the grand marshal is of this thing?

74
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,877
None other than Miss Chita Rivera.

75
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,112
They're not letting me in.

76
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,414
- My hand is out.
- We're gonna need more than a hand.

77
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,251
They have to see a human face.

78
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,086
You sure you want his face?

79
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,153
No, no, no.
It was Maria Conchita Alonso.

80
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,426
- This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
- The stare-ahead, I hate that.

81
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,365
I use it all the time.

82
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,234
Look at me. I am man.

83
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,068
I am you.

84
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,777
<i>Hi. Can we get in?</i>

85
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,378
All right, he's letting you in.
Thank you.

86
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,816
Oh, I know who it is. Stacy Keach.

87
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,014
- One more lane to go.
- All right. We're here.

88
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,962
Oh, look who's here.

89
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,190
My old buddy. Black Saab.

90
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,301
Maroon Golf.

91
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,130
Where you going, black Saab?

92
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,363
You seem to be a tad askew.

93
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,507
Could you move your car
back a little?

94
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,370
Oh, sorry.

95
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,374
I seem to have cut you off.

96
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,604
All right.
I know where this is going...

97
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,147
...and I am going somewhere else.

98
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,150
You can't do that.
You can't just leave the group.

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,118
I've been trying to leave this group
for 10 years.

100
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,555
Well, that's rude.

101
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,559
- Can you believe her?
- Yeah.

102
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,664
- I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

103
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,528
<i>The movies.
Blimp is playing right there.</i>

104
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,068
You're going to that again?
To do that stupid line?

105
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,798
It's a performance, Jerry.
Like what you do.

106
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,805
That's not what I do.

107
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,809
- Isn't it?
- Maybe a little.

108
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,471
Hell, I guess it is.

109
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,649
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't
worked a room that big in a while.

110
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,526
Look at that guy's dog.

111
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,789
I hate it when their ears
get flipped inside out like that.

112
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,660
Why doesn't he fix it?

113
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,930
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!

114
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,412
This isn't moving.

115
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,548
- I could walk faster than this.
- No, you can't.

116
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,885
Yes, I can. Here.

117
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,855
I'm out of here.

118
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,162
Now it's moving. Oh, yeah, I knew it.

119
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,133
Hey! Hey!

120
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,396
Where to?

121
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,873
That's cute. That's really cute.

122
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,116
Come on.

123
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,784
All right.

124
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,752
Bye again.

125
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,403
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!

126
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,776
Ladies.

127
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,476
I-I haven't seen this before.

128
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,447
Oh, what is that dot?

129
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,647
I think someone has one of those
funny laser pointers.

130
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,595
Give me a box of those
and one of those.

131
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,538
Excuse me. Are you the guy
with that funny laser?

132
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,606
The laser's not funny. I'm funny.

133
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,299
Yeah. The thing is...

134
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:29,813
...I had this little zinger of my own
I wanted to try.

135
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,442
It's right in the explosion scene...

136
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,180
...so if you could just leave me
a little window...

137
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,862
You know, my aunt had a thing
removed with a laser.

138
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,691
All right, I don't wanna
interrupt your meal, so...

139
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,094
<i>What a comeback
for the New York Mets.</i>

140
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,934
<i>- Six runs in the bottom of the ninth-
- I've gotta see this game.</i>

141
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,508
If it wasn't for this guy,
we could get out of here.

142
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,169
This traffic's a killer, ain't it?

143
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,577
You wanna get out of here?
Here's what we do.

144
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,616
We leave the car here.
We take the plates off...

145
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,722
...we scratch the serial number off
the engine block and we walk away.

146
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,120
- Walk away?
- Well, you've got insurance.

147
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,023
You tell them that the car was stolen,
and then you get another one free.

148
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,597
- Isn't there a deductible?
- All right, what is your deductible?

149
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,529
- I don't know.
- Yes.

150
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,034
Because they've already
deducted it.

151
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,104
- From what?
- The car.

152
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,709
Which we're leaving,
so the net is zero.

153
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,576
See, you pocket the money,
if there is any, and you get a new car.

154
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,612
We're not leaving the car.

155
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,687
All right. If you refuse to grow up
and scam your insurance company...

156
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,256
...you'll have to work this out
with maroon Golf.

157
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,023
Absolutely not. He sped up.

158
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,562
<i>Swing long, lined hard toward
left-center field...</i>

159
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,666
<i>...that's in the gap,
that's a base hit-</i>

160
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,358
I'm ready to talk.

161
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,730
Hey, there's that laser guy again.
He's funny.

162
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,138
- I never meet anyone funny.
- I know.

163
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,642
A sense of humor
is so much more important to me...

164
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,337
...than looks or hair.

165
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,120
That's gotta hurt!

166
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,724
It's gotta hurt!

167
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,218
Hurt!

168
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,598
Because...

169
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,323
Damn you, laser guy!

170
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,630
You had to grab it all
with your lowbrow laser shtick.

171
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,468
You're just a prop comic.
Where's the craft?

172
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,803
Look, it's on the bald guy.

173
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,471
I am so glad
we came to this showing.

174
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,012
Okay, here's the deal.

175
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,453
He wants you to acknowledge
that you cut him off...

176
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,286
...with an "I'm sorry" wave.

177
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,690
- What's that?
- You raise the hand, lower the head.

178
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,057
"I'm sorry. The buttons are really big
on the car.

179
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,461
I don't understand.
I haven't read the manual."

180
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,623
You get my drift.

181
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,029
Okay.

182
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:14,139
"Hallelujah. Praise the Lord."
But I'll take it.

183
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:19,148
Yes. All right, Lamar, back it up
a little bit so we can get out now.

184
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,617
All right. At last,
we're finally getting out of here.

185
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,483
What's that on your forehead?

186
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,646
Probably chocolate.

187
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,986
Is that one of those laser pointers?

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,460
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd,
it's a George Laserium.

189
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,963
All right, stop it.

190
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,158
Stay away from my breasts- Chest!

191
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,904
See you around, maroon Golf.

192
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,703
And by the way,
that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.

193
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,003
- What was that?
- I'm glad I cut you off...

194
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,203
...because black Saab rules.

195
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,508
So long, jackass.

196
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,047
Elaine?

197
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,848
Jerry?

198
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,824
Jackass. So I'm a jackass now?

199
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:17,238
So if everyone would just put their
cars in reverse at the same time...

200
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,604
...we can do this.

201
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,771
All right, on the count of three.
Can everyone hear me?

202
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,075
Hey, Amigo,
are you paying attention?

203
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,411
<i>Buenos días, my friend.</i>

204
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,143
Not you.

205
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,255
The guy in the Amigo.

206
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,020
Well, here.
Here is good.

207
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,457
Oh, yeah, sure.
Now I'm gonna be stuck here.

208
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,659
But you knew the way to go.
You went to college.

209
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,670
Hey, I went to Tufts.
It was my safety school.

210
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,207
So don't talk to me about hardship.

211
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,705
Boy. Can you believe this mess?

212
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,444
Elaine, why did you have the cab
come down this street?

213
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,951
We were almost out.

214
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,352
So that was your girlfriend
that blocked you in.

215
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,548
That's real good.

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,784
I'm not his girlfriend.

217
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,224
Well, actually, we used to date,
but not anymore-

218
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,330
- Elaine, he doesn't need-
- Used to date.

219
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,966
So I guess you found out
he's a jackass.

220
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,159
Because that's what's
gonna happen.

221
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,497
Oh, he's giving you a mustache.
Where is this guy?

222
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,006
No, don't. Don't look around.
That's what he wants.

223
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,803
All right, well, I'll see you.

224
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,274
Hey, George, I think there's a sniper
looking to pop you.

225
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,783
This thing can't hurt me, can it?
I mean, it is a laser.

226
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,354
- What if it hits my eye?
- I don't know.

227
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,991
I can't be blind, Jerry.
The blind are courageous.

228
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,026
You'll be fine, as long as
it doesn't hit you in the pupil...

229
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,824
...because then the whole ball
will go up like the Death Star.

230
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,263
All right, I gotta go find a bathroom.

231
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,997
Hold it, George. Don't move.
It's right between your eyes.

232
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,372
Oh, my God.

233
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,570
Hey, there's the soda guy.

234
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,605
Hey, jackass,
get me a Diet Dr. Pepper.

235
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,410
All right.

236
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,353
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

237
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,893
Oh, this is nuts.
I can't get across anywhere.

238
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,226
Well, none of us can. We're trapped.

239
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,696
Hey.

240
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,996
Hey, everyone, this way.
I think we can get out through here.

241
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,438
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

242
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,136
Look. No one knows
how long this parade is gonna last.

243
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,747
They are a very festive people.

244
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,444
All I know is that it's Sunday night,
and I have got to unwind.

245
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,985
Now, who's with me?

246
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,181
Father?

247
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,384
None of us saw the nylon flap.
That might mean something.

248
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:54,022
- All right.
- All right. Come on, come on. Let's go.

249
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,065
- Let's go.
- But it's dark.

250
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,294
Get in there.

251
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,450
Yes, I'm interested in the apartment.

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,850
- Yes, come in, come in.
- Okay.

253
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,686
I'm Christine Nyhart.

254
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,921
- Delicious to meet you.
- Did the broker send you over?

255
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,530
Yes, most likely.

256
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,326
Yes, I'm H. E. Pennypacker.

257
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm a wealthy industrialist
and philanthropist and a bicyclist.

258
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,803
And, yes, I'm looking for a place...

259
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,740
...where I can settle down
with my peculiar habits...

260
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,278
...and the women
that I frequent with.

261
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,415
Mombasa, huh?

262
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,109
The asking price is
a million and a half dollars.

263
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,687
I spend that much on aftershave.

264
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:55,486
Yes, I buy and sell men like myself
every day.

265
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,323
Now, I assume that there's
a waterfall grotto?

266
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,930
No.

267
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,226
- How about a bathroom?
- It has four.

268
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,768
Yes. And where would
the absolute nearest one be?

269
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,599
Just down the hall.

270
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,949
Oh, don't worry, we'll get you home
to your husband real soon.

271
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,110
I'm not married.

272
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,954
Well, I, for one, really respect that.

273
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,116
Thank you.

274
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,655
Hey. Guess who's not married.

275
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,363
Is the boyfriend still in the picture?

276
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,864
- Come on, Father, you can make it.
- No, I can't. I've got a bad hip.

277
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,340
- Go on without me.
- No, I won't.

278
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,172
Leave me. You must.

279
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,980
All right. Take it easy.

280
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,050
All right, we can move faster
without Father O'Gimpy.

281
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,119
I heard that.

282
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,152
You know, I don't think I've ever seen
a man driving a Saab convertible.

283
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,826
Still haven't.

284
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,757
What seems to be the problem,
officer?

285
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,800
They're for protection, Jerry.
Can you tell where I'm looking?

286
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,995
- At me?
- No.

287
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,038
Well, it's back.

288
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,198
Bring it on, baby.

289
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,968
What if it gets in the side?

290
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,202
- Side?
- Yeah.

291
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,576
Wouldn't it bounce back and forth
between your cornea and the mirror?

292
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,979
Faster and faster,
getting more intense, until-

293
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,175
All right.

294
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,413
- It's in your eye now.
- What?

295
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,857
<i>Hola, Jerry.</i>

296
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,494
I'm into this Puerto Rican Day.

297
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,961
The sights, the sounds.
The hot, spicy flavor of it all.

298
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,430
<i>It's caliente, Jerry.</i>

299
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,729
- The Mets got men on base.
- I know. I was watching the game.

300
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,235
You were watching? Where?

301
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,671
Oh, that was a strike.
Did you see that?

302
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,937
Would you like to see the rest
of the apartment, Mr. -?

303
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,877
Varnsen. Kel Varnsen.

304
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,177
Actually, this room intrigues me.
Why is it called the TV room?

305
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,650
- Well, it's -
- Balk? How was that a balk?

306
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,083
You have any snacks?

307
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,384
Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment,
I should tell you...

308
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,357
...I've also had some interest
from a wealthy industrialist.

309
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,796
Not Pennypacker.

310
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,024
- You know him?
- I wish I didn't.

311
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,464
Brace yourself, madam,
for an all-out bidding war.

312
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,400
But this time, advantage Varnsen.

313
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,942
- Wait a second.
- What?

314
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,310
I think I see where that laser guy is.

315
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,641
No, don't look, don't look.

316
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,780
Oh, yeah, that's him.

317
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,752
Okay. I'm gonna sneak up on him.

318
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,784
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

319
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,827
We should be able to get across
right through here.

320
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,491
It's a dead end.

321
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,864
- Oh, no. I thought-
- You thought?

322
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,972
We're gonna die in the dark.
I knew it.

323
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,200
- We're gonna die.
- Get a hold of yourself!

324
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,852
Sorry.

325
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,618
Somebody help us!

326
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,782
<i>Mira, mira, Stacy Keach!</i>

327
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,827
We're down here. Help.

328
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,021
There's people down there.

329
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,996
Hold on!

330
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,433
Let us out. There's an unmarried
pregnant woman down here.

331
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,507
Don't judge me.

332
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,775
Help us up
so we can cross the street?

333
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,382
No, no, you can't cross here.
There's a parade.

334
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,040
But we've come so far.

335
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,346
We just wanna unwind.

336
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,852
Yeah, what can I tell you.

337
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,222
Wanna make out some more?

338
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,363
Oh, God! Let us out!

339
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,739
Got it!

340
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,372
That wasn't a laser pen.

341
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,538
No. It's just a pen.

342
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,517
Oh, that's funny?

343
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,654
No, you have, like,
a dot on your face.

344
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,188
Whoever's doing that is very clever.

345
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,761
Come on, man.
You need to lighten up.

346
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,557
Yeah, a feeling like this
only happens once a year.

347
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,726
Yeah, it's like this every day
in Puerto Rico.

348
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,561
Yeah, see, now you're getting
the spirit of it, huh?

349
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,911
Hey. There's a guy burning
the Puerto Rican flag.

350
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,421
Who? Who is burning the flag?

351
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,388
Oh, no.

352
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,584
- Him?
- That's not very nice.

353
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,058
It was an accident.

354
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,595
Do you know what day this is?

355
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,165
Because I know what day this is.

356
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,801
They know what day this is...

357
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,700
...so I was wondering
if you know what day this is!

358
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,397
Because it's Puerto Rican Day.

359
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:14,035
Maybe we should stomp you
like you stomp the flag.

360
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,942
- What do you think?
- All right, look.

361
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,345
I just have one thing
to say to you boys.

362
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,486
Mama!

363
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,518
Get him.

364
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,958
Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.

365
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,856
Lovely, this is a lovely apartment.
Lovely.

366
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,055
The kids are gonna go crazy.

367
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,134
I wonder if I could see
the bathrooms.

368
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,794
Preferably one with some paint thinner
and some rags?

369
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,532
It's down the hall.

370
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,103
Oh, hello, Art.

371
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,338
Mr. Vandelay, of course.

372
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,505
You two know each other?

373
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,349
- Mr. Pennypacker.
- Yes.

374
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,613
Oh, yeah, I wanted to stop by
and make sure...

375
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,950
...that my shark tank fits-

376
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,285
Hello.

377
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,896
Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay,
and you know Mr. Varnsen.

378
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,496
- Varnsen.
- Pennypacker.

379
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,326
- Vandelay.
- Pennypacker. Varnsen.

380
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,195
Vandelay.

381
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,404
Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker,
if you're here...

382
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,009
...and Mr. Vandelay is also here,
then who's watching the factory?

383
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,145
- The factory?
- The Saab factory?

384
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,613
Jerry, that's in Sweden.

385
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,514
<i>The guy in here...</i>

386
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,710
My car.

387
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,561
Yeah. You know, it's like this
every day in Puerto Rico.

388
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,993
Jerry, the Mets lost.

389
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,827
I love a parade.

390
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,679
How do you suppose they did that?

391
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:59,806
Well, there's no logical
explanation.

392
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,312
- All right, shall we go home?
- Well, what about my car?

393
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,321
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.

394
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,886
Hey, there's Elaine.

395
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,187
Hey.

396
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,059
Well, you look relaxed.

397
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,599
Well, it is Sunday night,
and you know how I like to unwind.

398
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,037
Hey, black Saab.

399
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,233
Looks like that building cut you off.

400
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,934
See you around.

401
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,603
- Well, at least he didn't -
- Jackass.

402
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,418
Somebody remember
where we parked.

403
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,951
Well, this was a fun day.
It's nice to get out.
