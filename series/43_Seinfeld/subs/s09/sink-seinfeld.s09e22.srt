314
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,190
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

315
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,854
Yeah, that's right.

316
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,367
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...

317
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,972
...then George Costanza
as you know him ceases to exist.

318
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,541
You see, right now,
I have relationship George.

319
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,441
But there is also
independent George.

320
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,515
That's the George you know.
The George you grew up with.

321
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:30,314
Movie George. Coffee shop George.
Liar George. Bawdy George.

322
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,821
- I love that George.
- Me too.

323
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,585
And he's dying, Jerry.

324
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,628
If relationship George
walks through this door...

325
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,233
...he will kill independent George.

326
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,633
A George divided against itself
cannot stand!

327
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,137
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

328
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,636
No. No thanks, I'm just not hungry.

329
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,904
Then at least drink your beer.

330
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,372
Twist-off.

331
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,418
You have a little something
on your face.

332
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,482
She had man hands.

333
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,557
- He's a re-gifter.
- She's a two-face.

334
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,023
She's got the jimmy legs.

335
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,389
- She's a virgin.
- He's poor.

336
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,760
She's got everything I've always
wanted in another human being.

337
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,991
Except for the walking.

338
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,932
She eats her peas one at a time.

339
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,731
She just took credit for my salad.

340
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,602
He's a male bimbo. He's a mimbo.

341
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,209
- She's one of these low talkers.
- He's a high talker.

342
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,074
- Bit of a close talker.
- She can't hear very well.

343
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,841
- She's bald?
- She's bald!

344
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,678
He's a bad breaker-upper.

345
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,410
She went out with Newman.

346
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,054
He's like a Svengali.

347
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,689
- She's too tan.
- She's too good.

348
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,222
She wasn't my type.

349
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,225
She just dislikes me so much.

350
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,859
It's irresistible.

351
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,363
How could I do this?

352
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,028
How can I move back in
with those people? Tell me.

353
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,834
They're insane. You know that.

354
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,033
Hey, my parents
are just as crazy as yours.

355
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,769
- I'm paying.
- Dad, I'm paying.

356
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,607
- Get out of here.
- You're not paying.

357
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,147
Now, Jerry, please
do not do this to your father.

358
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,285
I can't get it open.

359
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,285
Yay, Jerry got it open.

360
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,052
How can you compare your parents
to my parents?

361
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,788
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows.

362
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,022
I stopped short.

363
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,860
<i>It's Frank Costanza,
Mr. Steinbrenner's here...</i>

364
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,695
<i>...George is dead, call me back.</i>

365
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,497
Georgie, I'm a divorcée.

366
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,730
You're not a divorcée.
You're just separated.

367
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,602
You're a " separatée."

368
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,176
- Well, I'm out there, George.
- You're not out there.

369
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,336
- I am too.
- You're not out there.

370
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,574
You can't be, because I am out there.
And if I see you out there...

371
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,843
...there's not enough voltage
in this world...

372
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,920
...to electroshock me
back into coherence.

373
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,952
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

374
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,294
Let me understand.

375
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,454
You got the hen, the chicken
and the rooster.

376
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,964
The rooster goes with the chicken.

377
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,102
So who's having sex with the hen?

378
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,802
- We'll talk about it another time.
- But you see my point?

379
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,340
You only hear of a hen,
a rooster and a chicken.

380
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,809
- Something's missing.
- Something's missing, all right.

381
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,540
They're all chickens.

382
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,877
The rooster has sex with all of them.

383
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,485
That's perverse.

384
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,173
Hello, and welcome
to Movie Phone.

385
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,607
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

386
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,972
Come on, come on.

387
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,239
Using your touch-tone keypad...

388
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,851
...please enter the first three letters
of the movie title now.

389
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,387
<i>You've selected Agent Zero.</i>

390
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,050
If that's correct, press one.

391
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,896
What?

392
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,090
<i>You've selected Brown-Eyed Girl.</i>

393
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,498
If this is correct, press one.

394
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,132
Why don't you just tell me
the name of the movie you selected?

395
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,404
That couple is breaking up.

396
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,777
They're breaking up?

397
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,214
- How do you know?
- She reads lips.

398
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,147
Oh, my God.

399
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,814
I-I just had a great idea.

400
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,887
She could come to the party tomorrow
and read Gwen's lips for me.

401
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,222
What?

402
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,402
We bring her to the party...

403
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,937
...and she tells me
what Gwen is saying about me.

404
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,606
She's not a novelty act, George...

405
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,440
...that you hire out
for weddings and bar mitzvahs.

406
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,380
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.

407
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,418
She'll probably enjoy showing it off.

408
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,319
I don't know, George.

409
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,187
I'm not sure about this.

410
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,353
Would you ask her? Just ask her.

411
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,492
- If she says no, case closed.
- All right.

412
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,698
Laura, George was wondering-

413
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,807
Sure. I'll do it.

414
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,202
Hey, there.

415
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,818
One mulligatawny, and...

416
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,719
- What is that? Is that lima bean?
- Yes.

417
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,121
Never been a big fan.

418
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,231
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you...

419
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,232
...you look exactly like Al Pacino?

420
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,427
<i>You know, Scent of a Woman.</i>

421
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,341
Very good. Very good.
You know something?

422
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,478
- No soup for you!
- What?

423
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,307
Come back, one year.

424
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,078
Kramer, I've been
reviewing your work.

425
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,516
Quite frankly, it stinks.

426
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,085
Well, I...

427
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,158
I've been having trouble
at home, and...

428
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,352
I mean, you know, I'll work harder.

429
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,292
Nights, weekends,
whatever it takes.

430
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:50,059
No. No, I don't think
that's going to do it.

431
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,671
These reports you handed in,
it's almost as if...

432
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,931
...you have
no business training at all.

433
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,043
I don't know
what this is supposed to be.

434
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:04,170
Well, I'm just trying to get ahead.

435
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,383
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way
that we could keep you on.

436
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,817
I don't even really work here.

437
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,325
That's what makes this so difficult.

438
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,521
I will never understand people.

439
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,563
They're the worst.

440
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,969
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

441
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,571
The mug is round.

442
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,298
The jar is round.

443
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,773
They should call it "Roundtine."

444
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,512
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

445
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,081
Stop.

446
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,254
Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.

447
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,695
Good night, honey.

448
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,760
Good night.

449
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,906
Come on, Uncle Leo, I've seen
the way women look at you.

450
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,908
When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.

451
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,512
You're the only one I know
who's got the good stuff.

452
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,707
And I need it bad. I feel like
I've got bugs crawling up my skin.

453
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,910
- Now, you gotta help me out.
- Not on my watch!

454
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,022
I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity.

455
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,215
- Get your fix somewhere else!
- Hey! Hey!

456
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,587
Go on, cretin!

457
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,190
Look at you, you're disgusting.

458
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,334
If a woman
can take your presence...

459
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,631
...for more than 10 seconds, you
should hang onto her like grim death.

460
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,070
Which is not far off, by the way.

461
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,938
Tim, do you think you should be
making jokes like that?

462
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,272
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?

463
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,340
- I know, but-
- Jerry.

464
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,783
It's our sense of humor that sustained
us as a people for 3000 years.

465
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,323
- Five thousand.
- Five thousand. Even better.

466
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,684
Okay.

467
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:02,162
Crissy, give me a shtickl of flouride.

468
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,029
What do you think, I've never
ridden in a Cadillac before?

469
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,138
Believe me, I have ridden
in a Cadillac hundreds of times.

470
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,568
Thousands.

471
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,309
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

472
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,674
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

473
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,475
Where did you get
that balm, anyway?

474
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,208
- The Maestro.
- The who?

475
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,219
Jerry.

476
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,714
Tonight you in for a real treat.

477
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,451
I'm personally
gonna prepare the dinner...

478
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,152
...for you and my Audrey.

479
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,800
Hey, Cedric, Bob.
This guy won't wear a ribbon.

480
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,144
Who? Who doesn't want
to wear the ribbon?

481
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,642
Hello, Jerry. May I come in?

482
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,381
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.

483
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,291
No, there's less.

484
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,653
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

485
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,131
Hello, Newman.

486
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,701
Excellent.

487
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,569
Excellent.

488
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,673
I've looked into his eyes.

489
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,001
He's pure evil.

490
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,608
All right. All right.

491
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,770
All right, you go ahead.
You go ahead, you keep it secret.

492
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,279
But you remember this.

493
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,820
When you control the mail,
you control information.

494
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,024
Oh, the humanity!

495
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,003
<i>Believe it or not,
George isn't at home</i>

496
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,234
<i>Please leave a message
At the beep</i>

497
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,477
<i>I must be out,
Or I'd pick up the phone</i>

498
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,675
<i>Where could I be?</i>

499
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,879
<i>Believe it or not, I'm not home</i>

500
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,045
It's funny, George.

501
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,624
You don't know how you're
feeling about something...

502
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,559
...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.

503
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,563
Articulate?

504
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,840
What?

505
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,437
- Live.
- Live?

506
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,669
- Live.
- Live?

507
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,303
- Live.
- Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

508
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,257
No. No. No. No. No.

509
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,951
Oh, yeah!

510
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,290
All right. All right. All right!

511
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,662
- George, Marla.
- Marla.

512
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,463
- George.
- Jerry, Stacy.

513
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,162
- Jerry.
- George, Stacy.

514
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,967
- Stacy.
- George.

515
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,836
- George.
- Jerry.

516
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,773
Marla. Stacy.

517
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,071
- Newman.
- Jerry.

518
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,645
- Elaine.
- George.

519
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,180
- Newman.
- Jerry.

520
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,442
- Kramer.
- Whatley.

521
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,744
- Newman.
- Jambalaya.

522
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,353
Are we finished?

523
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,045
Done.

524
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,189
- So you're still master of your domain?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

525
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,631
But I will tell you this.
I am going over to her apartment...

526
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,032
...and I'm telling her
to put those shades down.

527
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,832
Wait, wait. What did you just say?

528
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,874
I can't take it anymore.
She's driving me crazy.

529
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,206
I can't sleep, I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing the walls.

530
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,245
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

531
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,178
Something's gotta give.

532
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,154
He took it out.

533
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,025
He what?

534
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,220
He took...

535
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,062
...it out.

536
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,463
What are you doing to yourself?

537
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,695
I can't stop.

538
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,537
Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.

539
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,437
What? You can't keep this up.

540
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,237
Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

541
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,246
Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

542
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,077
Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

543
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,811
Is it? Look at this.

544
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,485
- What-? What is that?
- Jerry, look at it!

545
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,454
Look at it!

546
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,760
Could it be because you
don't want him to know...

547
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,923
...you have a friend
who pees in the shower?

548
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,035
- No, that's not it.
- Oh, I think it is.

549
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,728
- That's exactly what it is!
- Why couldn't you wait?

550
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,033
I was there! I saw a drain!

551
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,937
Since when is a drain a toilet?

552
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,169
It's all pipes! What's the difference?

553
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,404
Different pipes
go to different places.

554
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,139
I'll call a plumber right now!

555
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,614
Could we just drop
all the pee-pipe stuff here?

556
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,843
Okay!

557
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,904
What is that?

558
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,137
I think it's the horse.

559
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,042
Oh, my God.

560
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,116
Hey, how's everything?
You need anything?

561
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,013
I can't - I can't take this.

562
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,388
We can't breathe back here.

563
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,493
Rusty!

564
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,298
Rusty!

565
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,491
So we're gonna make the post office
pay for my new stereo now?

566
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,158
It's a write-off for them.

567
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,101
- How is it a write-off?
- They just write it off.

568
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,140
Write it off what?

569
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,334
Jerry, all these big companies,
they write off everything.

570
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,675
You don't even know
what a write-off is.

571
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,810
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

572
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,385
But they do.

573
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,489
And they're the ones writing it off.

574
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,620
I like sports.
I could do something in sports.

575
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,133
In what capacity?

576
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,866
You know, like the general manager
of a baseball team.

577
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,280
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

578
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,546
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

579
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,552
Maybe I could be, like, an announcer.
Like a color man.

580
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,658
You know how I always make those
interesting comments during the game.

581
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,056
Yeah.
Yeah, you make good comments.

582
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,787
So, what about that?

583
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:43,559
Well, you know, they tend to
give those jobs to ex-ballplayers...

584
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:48,228
...and people that are,
you know, in broadcasting.

585
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,670
- Well, that's really not fair.
- I know.

586
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,440
And I'll tell you another thing,
Cosmo Kramer.

587
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,982
The kissing thing is over.
There's no more kissing.

588
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,780
And I don't care
what the consequences are.

589
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,310
Kramer, what the hell is going-?

590
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,777
Jerry, come on, man.

591
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,884
- Are you in?
- What, are you kidding?

592
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,649
You see those ladies
I got showing?

593
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,919
You think they're scared?

594
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,790
Oh, man, you're killing me.

595
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,532
Oh, forget it.

596
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,505
Julia's still laughing.

597
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,042
Okay.

598
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,875
There's no point in going.
Julia's laughing.

599
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,815
- No I'm not.
- Okay, can we go?

600
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,479
- No. She's laughing. Right now.
- Yes. Yes. We can go.

601
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,853
Go ahead, waste the film.
Waste everyone's time.

602
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,757
Okay, here we go. All right.

603
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,659
And action.

604
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,159
Kasha?

605
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,005
Hello.

606
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,648
What are you doing here?

607
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,343
I don't know.

608
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,348
You telling me there's
not one condo available...

609
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,584
...in all of Del Bofa-
Del- Del Boca Vista?

610
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,749
That's right.

611
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:55,024
In all of Del- Del- Del Vista-
Del- Del Boca Visto?

612
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,293
- In all of Del Besta Bicko?
- That's right.

613
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,336
In all of Del Visto Becko?

614
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,405
- Hey.
- You ought to come over.

615
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,439
Tonight's pipe night.

616
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,545
No, thanks.

617
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,851
Come on.

618
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,521
What happened to your face?

619
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,989
It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

620
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,328
It's-It's all that s-

621
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,199
Come on.

622
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,195
What did you expect?

623
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,809
- What?
- Your teeth are all brown.

624
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,679
No.

625
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,316
Look away, I'm hideous.

626
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,666
See you.

627
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,775
- Okay, where's my boy?
- Oh, my God.

628
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,035
My George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.

629
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,805
You got that right.

630
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,539
What the hell does that mean?

631
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,922
What the hell does that-?

632
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,723
Come on. Okay. Let's go, let's go.

633
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,424
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

634
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,166
You're saying
you want a piece of me?

635
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,411
You saying you want a piece of me?

636
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,683
You saying you want a piece of me?

637
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,895
You want a piece of me?

638
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,038
You got it!
