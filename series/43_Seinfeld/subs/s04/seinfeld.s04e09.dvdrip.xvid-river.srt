1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,671
The tuxedo is a woman's view
that men are all the same.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,807
We might as well
dress them that way.

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:13,518
To me, a wedding is the joining
together of a beautiful, glowing bride...

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,267
...and some guy.

5
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:19,518
The tuxedo is a wedding safety
device, created by women...

6
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,772
...because they know that men
are undependable.

7
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,698
So in case the groom chickens out...

8
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,070
...everybody takes one step over,
and she marries the next guy.

9
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:30,407
That's why the wedding vow isn't,
"Do you take Bill Simpson?"

10
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:32,621
It's, " Do you take this man?"

11
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,672
<i>Leave a message.
I'll call you back. Thanks.</i>

12
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:44,418
Jerry? Joe Davola.

13
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,880
I have a hair on my tongue.

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,388
Can't get it off.

15
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:53,554
You know how much I hate that?

16
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,933
Of course you do.
You put it there.

17
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,065
I know what you said about me,
Seinfeld.

18
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:02,272
I know you bad-mouthed me
to the execs at NBC.

19
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:04,985
Put the kibosh on my deal.

20
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:08,112
Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.

21
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,571
You know I've kiboshed before.

22
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:14,201
<i>And I will kibosh again.</i>

23
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,833
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

24
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,008
- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.

25
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,467
- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.

26
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,426
What are they singing for?
Who sings?

27
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,305
You got something to say, say it.

28
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,434
You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.

29
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:38,682
They sing to one another.

30
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,443
All right. All right.

31
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,692
That's the way they was.
You listen to the language.

32
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,075
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.

33
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,534
It's the language, Jerry.
The language.

34
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:57,616
- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.

35
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:00,415
You know, they got-
They were tired.

36
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,703
- Better get that.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:05,005
<i>- It's me.
- Come on up.</i>

38
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,418
- So?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:12,056
<i>Come on. It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci. The great clown.</i>

40
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,392
The great, sad, tragic clown,
like you.

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,103
Well, that's very flattering.

42
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,396
How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.

43
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,644
Well, I have many associates.

44
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,980
I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.

45
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,274
Then I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,072
Wait a minute. What about
George, Susan and Elaine?

47
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,284
- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus...

48
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>...the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana."</i>

49
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,617
<i>I guess if I'm the magliana,
I should go.</i>

50
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,622
All right. All right.

51
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,077
- Hi.
- Hey.

52
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:45,502
You got the tickets, right?

53
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:49,340
- No, I don't have them on me.
- What? That's why I came over here.

54
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,635
My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

55
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:55,934
I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?

56
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,561
Oh, yeah!

57
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,307
So I finally get to meet
your pal Joey.

58
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,898
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,189
So Joey's a great lover of the opera.

60
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:10,357
Listen...

61
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,528
...I got news for you.

62
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,529
It's nice to be involved
with somebody...

63
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,539
...who's interested in something
other than Nick at Nite.

64
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,451
You know, he's got a grip on reality.

65
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,961
He's- He's happy. He's well-adjusted.

66
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:36,099
Looking forward to meeting him.

67
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,892
I gotta go.

68
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,717
Where? What's the rush?

69
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,972
To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.

70
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:45,065
- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.

71
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,112
Hey.

72
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,316
You got a message, buddy.

73
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:53,986
It could be from that blond.

74
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,581
<i>Jerry? Joe Davola.</i>

75
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,246
<i>I have a hair on my tongue.</i>

76
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,043
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.

77
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:18,171
- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady! Now, calm yourself!

78
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:21,305
He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.

79
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,100
- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet! Now let me think.

80
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,228
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing. The cops.

81
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:29,436
Why?! They're not gonna
do anything!

82
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,439
They're the cops.
They gotta do something.

83
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:34,532
He'll put the kibosh on me. Do you
know what it is to be kiboshed?

84
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,946
- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.

85
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:42,537
He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.

86
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,042
- Call and tell him that.
- That- That's what I'll do.

87
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:50,257
I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do. Right.

88
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,049
He's a human being.
I'll talk to him. He'll understand, right?

89
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,963
Yeah.

90
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,549
Don't mention my name.

91
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,601
Oh, I got the machine.

92
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,475
- What's his message like?
- Nice.

93
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,189
Hello, Joe. Listen,
this is Jerry Seinfeld.

94
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:12,024
I think there's been a huge, colossal
misunderstanding.

95
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:14,818
Big. Big.

96
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,363
If we could just talk,
we could straighten this out...

97
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,322
<i>...so call me back. Bye.</i>

98
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,160
Joey?

99
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,829
Joey?

100
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:50,271
Oh, God. It's you. You scared me.

101
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,148
Good. Fear's our most
primal emotion.

102
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,989
You left your door open.

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,773
I know. I like to encourage intruders.

104
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:05,989
What is all this?

105
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,412
Do you like it?

106
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:11,535
My home is a shrine to you.

107
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,041
Where did you get all these pictures?

108
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:17,217
I took them myself
with a telephoto lens.

109
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,717
Coming out of your office,
your apartment.

110
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,593
Shopping.

111
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,344
Showering.

112
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,475
Showering?

113
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:30,391
I develop them myself
in my darkroom.

114
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,725
Would you-? Would you like to see?

115
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,815
In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.

116
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,231
Not right now.

117
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:42,409
I'm a day person.

118
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,907
Are-? Are you all right?

119
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,995
Why?

120
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:54,790
Well, I don't know.
You just don't...

121
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,836
- ...seem yourself.
- Who am I?

122
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,173
- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.

123
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:05,883
Good question. It's very existential.

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,595
Who are you? Who am I?
Well...

125
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,429
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,359
Oh, nothing. I just stopped by
to chat.

127
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,852
You know, shoot the breeze.

128
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,149
<i>Were you able to get those Pagliacci
opera tickets from your friend?</i>

129
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:22,068
I'm really looking forward to it.

130
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,113
No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.

131
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,160
Really?

132
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:35,837
Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.

133
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:40,633
I left something on. The gas,
the lights, the water in the tub.

134
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,674
Something is on somewhere,
so I'm just gonna get the-

135
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,809
Do you know the story of Pagliacci,
Nedda?

136
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm Elaine.

137
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:54,768
He's a clown whose wife
is unfaithful to him.

138
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:59,356
Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?

139
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:04,153
Do I think you're a clown?
No. Not if it's bad to be a clown.

140
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:08,324
If it's bad to be a clown, then
you are definitely not a clown.

141
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:13,373
But if it's good to be a clown, then I
would have to rethink the whole thing.

142
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,957
You've betrayed me with another,
haven't you, Nedda?

143
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,254
Who is he? I want you
to tell me who he is.

144
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,714
I want his name. Tell me his name.

145
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,504
Oh, like any man would
ever look at me. Come on.

146
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm gonna get out of here.

147
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,010
Pagliacci kills his wife.

148
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:33,685
See? Now that's terrible. That is-
That's not a nice thing to do at all.

149
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:37,474
I would assume- I don't know how
this Pagliacci thing turns out.

150
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:41,601
But I would assume that there was
big, big trouble for that clown.

151
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,192
You're not leaving.

152
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:50,913
But, officer, he threatened me.

153
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:52,706
I don't understand.
That's not right.

154
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,209
What if it was the president
of the U.S.? I bet you'd investigate.

155
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,246
So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.

156
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,468
And I'll tell you, I'm under
just as much pressure.

157
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:07,172
All right. Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.

158
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:12,931
- Who is it?
- It's George.

159
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,770
- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.

160
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,822
Well, well. Look at you.

161
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:36,127
It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?

162
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,953
You know the last time
I wore this thing?

163
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,376
Six years ago.

164
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,837
When I made that toast
at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

165
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,086
Oh, that was a bad toast.

166
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,673
It wasn't that bad.

167
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,385
I never heard anybody curse
in a toast.

168
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,093
I was trying to loosen them up
a little bit.

169
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,012
There were old people there.

170
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:59,137
All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.

171
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,100
At the end of the toast,
nobody even drank.

172
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,065
They were just standing. They were
just frozen. People-

173
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:09,360
That might have been
one of the worst all-time toasts.

174
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,785
Still, her father didn't have
to throw me out like that.

175
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,363
He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.

176
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,203
Susan's not going tonight.

177
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,252
What do you mean, not going?
Why not?

178
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,627
She had to pick up a friend
at the airport.

179
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,625
It cost me $100, this ticket.

180
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,552
- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.

181
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,966
She and I go to dinner,
she doesn't even reach for the check.

182
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,809
All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?

183
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,636
It's nice to get a reach.

184
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,900
- Who is it?
- It's me!

185
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,566
Why are you locking the door now?

186
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,482
Because of Davola.
Get in here.

187
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,614
What the-?

188
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,073
- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.

189
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,033
- You're going like this?
- Yeah. I want you to hear something.

190
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,336
- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do. I don't.

191
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,461
If you're going like that,
I'm not going like this.

192
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:09,084
Wait a minute! Do you think
I'm comfortable here?

193
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,670
I can't change. I got no clothes here.

194
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,089
You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.

195
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:17,137
Why should I be uncomfortable
because my apartment is closer?

196
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,351
That's not the issue. We're friends.

197
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,514
If I gotta be uncomfortable,
you gotta too.

198
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,106
All right. I'll wear this. It's bad enough
I gotta go to the opera...

199
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:28,064
...I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson
over here.

200
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:31,033
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?

201
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,943
<i>It's Pagliacci.</i>

202
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,613
Oh, beautiful.

203
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:37,242
We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.

204
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,621
- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going...

205
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:43,706
...and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic. We'll scalp the tickets.

206
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,453
We can make maybe 500 a ticket.

207
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:48,043
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:50,755
People are looking for tickets here?

209
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:55,972
<i>Are you kidding? Opening night,
Pavarotti in Pagliacci?</i>

210
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:59,226
- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.

211
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:02,728
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.

212
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,769
Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theatre.

213
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,770
- Yeah.
- All right. Isn't scalping illegal?

214
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,772
Oh, yeah.

215
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:30,503
You sprayed him in the eyes
with Binaca?

216
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:35,551
Cherry Binaca. It's new.

217
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,427
See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.

218
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,011
A year later, they have cherry.

219
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:43,436
They know we like cherry. Start with
cherry. Then come out with regular.

220
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,733
It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.

221
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,941
You should hear the message
from my nut.

222
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,607
Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.

223
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,774
I feel very vulnerable.

224
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,160
What you doing?
That's my quarter.

225
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:00,531
- No, it's not. It's mine.
- I was just flipping it. That's mine.

226
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,034
No, I dropped it. It's mine.

227
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,541
All right, you want it, take it,
but don't try and tell me it's yours.

228
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,122
Well, it is mine.

229
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,296
What, you think I care
about the money?

230
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,125
Is that what you think? I'll show you.

231
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,960
Look at this. Here's a dollar. Look.

232
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:14,677
That's how much
I care about money.

233
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:18,179
You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.

234
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,217
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?

235
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,468
- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?

236
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,222
Yeah.

237
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:31,651
I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.

238
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:36,992
Anybody else got a problem?

239
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:42,323
- Hey, clown.
- Clown.

240
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:44,747
Make us laugh, clown.

241
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,408
- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.

242
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,673
<i>I got two. I got two. Pagliacci.</i>

243
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,468
<i>Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.</i>

244
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,761
<i>Come on, check it out. He laughs,
he cries, he sings. Pagliacci.</i>

245
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,308
I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.

246
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,389
- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?

247
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,108
I'm selling.

248
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,810
- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead centre. Primo.

249
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,360
You think you died
and went to heaven.

250
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:17,730
What do you want for them?

251
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:20,280
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.

252
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,363
A thousand dollars for the deuce.

253
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,285
- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah. It's a deal.

254
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,995
- No.
- What, no? Are you crazy?

255
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,454
- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500. That's a great deal.

256
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,539
You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.

257
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:37,844
Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?

258
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,885
That was a $300 profit.

259
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,715
I know what I'm doing here, George.

260
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,975
This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?

261
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:47,551
A little dignity. A little class.
Give me my ticket.

262
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,390
I will stand over here and sell it.

263
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,771
Thank you. Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.

264
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:53,982
- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.

265
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:56,691
<i>- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?</i>

266
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:58,774
Where are they already?

267
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:01,155
I guarantee you they don't
sell those tickets.

268
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,743
Hey, look. There's Bobby Leighton's
father-in-law. Mr. Reichman.

269
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:06,906
George and I were just talking
about him.

270
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,166
He threw George out of the wedding.

271
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,832
Oh, yeah, when George
made that bad toast.

272
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,337
- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah. The curse toast.

273
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,877
Can you believe that message?

274
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,257
I gotta spend my life looking
over my shoulder.

275
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,302
Me too.

276
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,432
Crazy Joe Davola.

277
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,925
- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?

278
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:32,024
- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.

279
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,064
- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.

280
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,561
Right, Joe Davola.

281
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,858
How do you know his name?

282
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:44,778
I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.

283
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,371
- Oh, my God! It's Joe Davola?
- He's stalking you?

284
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,699
- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman...

285
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,793
- ...who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?

286
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:56,085
Last night he accused me
of seeing someone else.

287
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,545
- He said, "Tell me his name!"
- He said that?

288
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,793
If he sees us, can you imagine
what he'll do?

289
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:03,377
If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal
and stole his girl!

290
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,473
- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?

291
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:08,266
Excuse me.

292
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:11,302
Come on. This is Pavarotti.

293
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:14,144
Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.

294
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:17,352
Steven Holtzman did a production
in Tunis last year.

295
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,110
From what I understand,
the Muslims really took to it.

296
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,316
I'll tell you what. You seem like a
nice guy. Let's stop jerking around.

297
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:29,997
Give me $250. I got people waiting
for me. I gotta get the hell out of here.

298
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,161
Scalping. I told them
to put on extra security.

299
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:34,746
Excuse me.

300
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,756
Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.

301
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:40,129
- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?

302
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,340
Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.

303
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:48,098
Harold, don't. Harold, be careful
of your hair transplant!

304
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,758
Anything is welcome.
I accept change.

305
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,771
I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.

306
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:58,016
You know, you could just say no.

307
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,652
You don't have to humiliate me.

308
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,189
I may be dressed as a clown,
but I am a person.

309
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,856
- The guy took-
- I don't need people like you...

310
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,612
...looking down their noses at me.

311
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:11,784
I am just a street performer
trying to make enough to get by.

312
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,413
Doctor. Is there a doctor anywhere?

313
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,127
We need a doctor!

314
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,664
What are you, showing off
for your girlfriend here, is that it?

315
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,885
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated
for a while but things didn't work out.

316
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,137
You people make me sick.

317
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,560
That is one angry clown.

318
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,556
The hardest part
about being a clown...

319
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:39,479
...it seems to me, would be that you're
constantly referred to as a clown.

320
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:42,059
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.

321
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,696
Did you hire that clown?

322
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,239
The guy's a clown."

323
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,323
How do you even start into
being a clown?

324
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,236
How do you know you
wanna be a clown?

325
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,198
I guess you just get to a point
where your pants look so bad...

326
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,788
...it's actually easier
to become a clown...

327
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,081
...than having the proper alterations
done.

328
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,251
If you think about it, a clown,
if there isn't a circus around them...

329
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,879
...is really just a very annoying person.

330
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,420
I mean, you're in the back seat
of this guy's Volkswagen-

331
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:10,881
"What, you're picking somebody
else up? Oh, man."

332
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:14,344
<i>I got one. Who needs one?
Pagliacci. Pagliacci.</i>

333
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,012
<i>The tragic clown. Pagliacci...</i>

334
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,312
What did you say?

335
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,981
What, are you a cop?

336
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,734
No. I'm a clown.

337
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,368
Man, you look familiar.

338
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,039
You ever been to the circus?

339
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:38,079
- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?

340
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,707
Well, it was fun.

341
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,953
Was kind of scared of the clowns.

342
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,756
Are you still scared of clowns?

343
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,632
Yeah.

344
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,642
We're gonna miss the overture.

345
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:01,144
<i>Overture, curtains, lights
This is it, we'll hit the heights</i>

346
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:07,485
<i>And, oh, what heights we'll hit
On with the show, this is it</i>

347
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:13,948
You know, it is so sad.

348
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:17,157
All your knowledge of high culture
comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.

349
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:22,419
Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?

350
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,919
Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.

351
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,663
- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.

352
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,587
I smell cherry.

353
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,471
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?

354
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,768
Go! Go!

355
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:46,440
- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two-fifty.

356
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,439
- Two-fifty? Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

357
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,280
- All right. All right, 250.
- George!

358
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,868
- Susan.
- I don't believe it.

359
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,114
I'm so glad I caught you.

360
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:01,030
What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.

361
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,368
Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.

362
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,380
So what? They don't have another
plane? She couldn't take a bus?

363
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,956
She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.

364
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,257
Yeah. How about that? You made it.

365
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:14,714
I'm so excited. Now we get to see
the opera together.

366
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,389
We get to go to the opera-
Get out of here- Together.

367
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,051
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.

368
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:23,851
He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.

369
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,693
Enjoy the show there, Harry!

370
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:29,819
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what?

371
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:32,479
- Come on. You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.

372
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:34,531
We have tickets. Just not with us.

373
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,572
Well, that's a problem. Excuse me.

374
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,660
You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.

375
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:43,750
- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?

376
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,326
Oh, that's rich.

377
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,628
Clear the way so people
with tickets can pass.

378
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,672
- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?

379
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,420
- Yes. Yes.
- Have you seen George?

380
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,050
- We thought he was with you.
- Come on. He's on his own.

381
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,680
Here.

382
00:20:58,016 --> 00:20:59,925
Here I come.

383
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,309
- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:08,897
Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.

385
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,275
Eva Marton. I've heard of her.

386
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:15,111
- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.

387
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:17,691
- Nedda?
- Yeah.

388
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,109
Oh, my God.

389
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:22,656
Excuse me. Excuse me.

390
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,113
Excuse me.

391
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,119
Excuse me.

392
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,636
Susan, what are you doing here?

393
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,930
- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.

394
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,853
- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.

395
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,772
He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.

396
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,351
Uncomfortable?

397
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,399
How do you think I feel?

398
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:55,104
- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One-seventy-five.

399
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,984
Kramer, who did you sell
your ticket to?

400
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:03,162
Some nut in a clown suit.

401
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,416
I had some friends drag me
to an opera recently.

402
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,631
They've all got those little
opera glasses.

403
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,670
Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get...

404
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:21,213
...before you can spot them?

405
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:26,634
These opera kids, they're going
250, 280, 325.

406
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,853
They're wearing
big white woolly vests.

407
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:32,772
The women have the breastplates,
the bullet hats, the horns coming out.

408
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:35,186
You can't pick these people out,
forget opera.

409
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:40,191
Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.
