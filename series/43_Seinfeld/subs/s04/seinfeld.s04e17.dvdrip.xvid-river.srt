1
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:06,380
The problem with the beginning
of the relationship...

2
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:09,131
...is each person has their
own sexual timetable...

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,596
...of what should happen when, that
the other person knows nothing about.

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:16,058
That's why I think we need
some sort of sexual rule book...

5
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,273
...where it's written down
and agreed upon...

6
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:21,280
...sexual standard dating procedure.

7
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,021
Know what I mean? So if there's
any problems, you can go:

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,201
"Look, honey, I'm sorry,
but we've been out three times...

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,742
...and according to Article 7,
Section 5...

10
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:33,788
...there's got to be some physical
contact, as you can see right there.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,869
Otherwise,
I will report you to the board...

12
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:38,121
...and they can issue a warrant
for an embrace."

13
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:44,965
Wait a second. Wait a second.

14
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:47,925
Then the butler says,
"I'm not cleaning it up.

15
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:51,219
- I'm sick of cleaning!"
- That's funny. That's funny.

16
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:53,802
"I'm sick of cleaning."
That's very funny.

17
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:55,974
I've never seen a pilot script
this funny.

18
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,141
- Yeah, it's funny.
- How funny is this?

19
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,690
- It's funny.
- I mean, we're not stupid, right?

20
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:04,195
- We know when something's funny.
- It cannot not be funny.

21
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,035
Come on, let's stay with it.
We gotta finish this today.

22
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:09,527
Maybe I should give it
to my therapist to read.

23
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,575
- She's smart. I trust her.
- Maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

24
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:15,910
We haven't brought the Elaine
character into the show yet.

25
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,628
We should get her into this scene.

26
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:20,666
Right. Right. Okay.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,509
"Elaine enters."

28
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:24,874
Right.

29
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:27,088
What does she say?

30
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:33,517
- I don't know. What do women say?
- I don't know.

31
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,890
I don't even know what they think.
That's why I'm in therapy.

32
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:40,359
If we bring Elaine in, it'll be
so many people to keep track of.

33
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:42,852
It's too hard. I forget where
everybody is standing.

34
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:45,022
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.

35
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:48,407
- All right, forget Elaine.
- All right.

36
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,157
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:57,543
You are never gonna believe
who I just ran into today.

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,036
- Who?
- Your old flame: Gail Cunningham.

39
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:01,458
Did you talk to her?

40
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,466
Well, I was on my way to the Y,
and I saw her coming towards me.

41
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,009
I didn't know what to do.

42
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:08,086
I remember you had
three dates with her...

43
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,136
...and she wouldn't
kiss you good night.

44
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,880
So now I'm thinking,
"What is my duty to my friend?

45
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:15,135
Do I acknowledge her?
Do I ignore her?"

46
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,719
- I mean, what is my responsibility?
- So, what happened?

47
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:21,598
You know, she sees me
and she goes, " Hi, Kramer!"

48
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,354
Like nothing happened.

49
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:27,146
Like she never went three dates
with you and refused to kiss you.

50
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:31,570
- Yeah, I know about the three dates.
- You know what I did? I snubbed her.

51
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:36,620
- What do you mean you snubbed her?
- I walked by her, never said a word.

52
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,912
- Right by her?
- Right by her.

53
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,253
What do you say about a guy
like this, huh?

54
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:47,835
You are some great friend. I'll tell you.
Snubbed her. Not that I condone it.

55
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,216
I've never condoned snubbing
in my administration.

56
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,429
But your loyalty is beyond question.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,723
Well, you know, she's lucky I was
in a good mood.

58
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,353
Could have been a lot worse.

59
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,650
- I'm not even in here.
- Yeah, I know.

60
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,606
I thought there was gonna be
a character named " Elaine Benes."

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,939
There were too many people
in the room.

62
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,694
We couldn't keep track
of everybody:

63
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,196
George and the butler-

64
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:16,121
You "couldn't keep track
of everybody"?

65
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,124
Well, we tried. We couldn't.
We didn't know how to...

66
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:24,001
We couldn't write for a woman.
We didn't know what you would say.

67
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,622
Even right now,
I know you're gonna say something.

68
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,424
I have no idea what it is.

69
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:30,799
You have no idea?

70
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,137
Something derogatory?

71
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,592
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Well, Gail Cunningham.

72
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,761
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi, Elaine.

73
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,060
- What is with your friend, Kramer?
- Why?

74
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,476
He snubbed me.

75
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,309
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

76
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,652
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. Hey, give me that.

77
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,989
- I thought you finished.
- I took two bites. How am I finished?

78
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,824
Plus, you're coming down with
something. You want me to get sick?

79
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,283
Bite?

80
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,330
I wanna know.
Why did Kramer do that?

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,666
I don't know. Once he leaves the
building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

82
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:07,122
- Tell him that I am mad at him.
- All right. So where you cooking now?

83
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:09,332
- Pfieffer's.
- Oh, the power-lunch crowd.

84
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:11,670
Nice shoes.

85
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,302
- Thank you.
- Where did you get them?

86
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:17,679
They're Botticelli's.

87
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:22,521
Botticelli's. Look at you.
I'm afraid to go in there.

88
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,183
Really?

89
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,525
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no. I gotta get to the restaurant.

90
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,069
- See you.
- See you.

91
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:35,780
"Look at you with your Botticelli's."

92
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,526
- That bothered you?
- Yes, it bothered me.

93
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:40,993
So I bought a pair of shoes
at Botticelli's.

94
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,707
I'm not allowed to shop there?

95
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,785
That really embarrassed me.

96
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:48,709
- It did?
- Yes. Couldn't you see that?

97
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,080
No.

98
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,465
This is why you're not in the pilot.

99
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:01,049
Well, George, I think you're beginning
to get some perspective on things.

100
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,852
I think we're making progress.

101
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,271
- Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
- Good. Let's pick up on this next week.

102
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,686
Great.

103
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:13,651
By the way, did you get a chance
to read the script?

104
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:16,065
Yes. Yes, I did.

105
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,902
Well, what did you think?

106
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,951
It was...

107
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,401
...good.

108
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,743
You didn't like it?

109
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:28,085
Well, no-

110
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:31,250
I can't believe this. What was wrong
with it? What didn't you like?

111
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,580
It wasn't funny.

112
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,594
It wasn't funny?
What, are you kidding?

113
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:38,050
No. I didn't find it funny.

114
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:41,923
You didn't find it funny?
This is what I'm paying for?

115
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:45,727
Well, that whole story line about a guy
who gets into a car accident...

116
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:49,515
...doesn't have insurance, so the judge
sentences him to be a butler?

117
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:51,234
I didn't really buy that.

118
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:57,322
Let me tell you who did buy it.
We pitched this story...

119
00:05:57,492 --> 00:06:02,450
...to Russell Dalrymple, the president
of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

120
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,579
If you're going to be
in a creative field...

121
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:07,370
...you're gonna have to learn how
to deal with criticism.

122
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,002
How's this for criticism?

123
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,374
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?

124
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:17,049
You know what's funny to me?
That diploma up on the wall.

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,971
That is my idea of comedy.

126
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,464
You sitting here,
telling people what to do.

127
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:26,093
- I think you'd better go.
- I'm going baby. I'm going!

128
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,141
It's Jerry's fault.

129
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,610
He took out all my good lines.
He's such a control freak.

130
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:42,274
So you send me to this therapist to
help me with my emotional disorders...

131
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,611
...and she criticizes our script.

132
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,781
What kind of a therapist is that?

133
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,496
Well, I guess she didn't
think it was funny.

134
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,536
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.
What is she, Rowan and Martin?

135
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,082
We're supposed to meet
with NBC tomorrow.

136
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,085
She completely shattered
my confidence.

137
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,502
And I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,591
- I thought your mother's paying for it.
- And she slaves to earn every penny...

139
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,888
...so that someday I might be able
to walk up to a woman and say:

140
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:12,646
"Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

141
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,390
He's right. It's not her place
to criticize the script.

142
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,487
Which reminds me. What did you
think of it? You never told me

143
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,607
- What did I think of it?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,910
Hey, buddy,
I got something to tell you.

145
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,329
Now, one second. You won't get off
that easy. Tell me what you thought.

146
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:31,204
- Well, you know-
- I just kissed Gail Cunningham.

147
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,831
- You what?
- Yeah, I kissed her.

148
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,713
- You kissed her?
- Right on the mouth.

149
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,511
What kind of great friend are you?

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,554
How do you go
from snubbing to kissing?

151
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:48,508
I saw her outside the Y. She came up
to me, she started yelling...

152
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:52,386
...because I snubbed her.
Then we started talking a little bit...

153
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:56,183
...and I walked her to her building.
And just before I left...

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,314
...I put my arm around her waist.
I pulled her to me...

155
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,564
...and I planted one.

156
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:06,245
- What did she do?
- She kissed me back.

157
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,077
I don't get this. I go out with this girl
three times, she won't shake my hand.

158
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,289
Why is she kissing you?

159
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:16,665
Because I snubbed her.
You see? Women, they like that.

160
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,250
Yes, I understand women.

161
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:21,923
The snub is good.
They love the snub.

162
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,091
No they don't. I tried that once.

163
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,636
I snubbed for a year. Nothing.

164
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,427
Every woman I saw, I snubbed.
You never saw people so pleased.

165
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:37,438
So I understand you're buying
new shoes now at Botticelli's.

166
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,065
What? Who told you that?

167
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:41,945
Gail Cunningham.

168
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,783
I don't understand. Why is this woman
talking about my shoes?

169
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,952
Why are my shoes a topic
of conversation?

170
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,743
We were just talking,
and she mentioned...

171
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,288
...how you're buying your
shoes now at Botticelli's.

172
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,794
How I'm buying my shoes now
at Botticelli's.

173
00:08:57,963 --> 00:08:59,458
Did you hear this?

174
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:03,132
So what?

175
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:09,052
So what? She is talking about my
shoes. She is discussing my shoes.

176
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:13,554
It is nobody's business where
I buy my shoes.

177
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,982
- Hey, Gail?
- Yeah.

178
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:27,982
Elaine.

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,283
- Why are you talking about my shoes?
- What?

180
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,408
My Botticelli shoes. You've been
talking about my Botticelli shoes.

181
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,827
What are you talking about?

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,915
Did you or did you not tell Kramer
that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?

183
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,547
Too spicy. He wants another one.

184
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:44,048
- You got that pasta primavera?
- Elaine, I am very busy here.

185
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,968
Who else have you mentioned
my shoes to?

186
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,924
I want to know why my footwear
is your conversation?

187
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:52,005
I am not discussing this.
This is insane.

188
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,892
You got that pasta primavera?
Let's go!

189
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,943
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

190
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,025
Sorry for the delay.
Enjoy your lunch.

191
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,453
- Well, come in. Come in.
- Hi.

192
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,865
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,497
Sorry to make you come up here...

194
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:17,452
...but I wasn't feeling well
enough to go back to the office.

195
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:20,580
Well, it's the only chance I have
to meet with you this week.

196
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,462
- Are you all right?
- It's my stomach.

197
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:26,166
There must have been something in
the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

198
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,633
- Where did you eat?
- Pfeiffer's.

199
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,468
- I know the chef there.
- Food is usually terrific.

200
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,931
My cousin worked for Bouchard's.

201
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,187
They used to use the bouillabaisse
for a toilet.

202
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,607
What are you saying?

203
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,230
Well, you didn't hear it from me,
but needless to say...

204
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,237
...if you go in there,
stick with the consommé.

205
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,063
We better get started.
My daughter's gonna be here soon.

206
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,439
Oh, you have a daughter.

207
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,369
- She just turned 15 last week.
- That's a fun age.

208
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:54,735
Yeah.

209
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:56,576
All right.

210
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,041
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

211
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,410
Yeah?

212
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,456
And every time I read it...

213
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,506
What?

214
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:14,505
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?

215
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,934
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

216
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,560
You think he liked it?

217
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,529
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:40,873
- What was that dish he said-
- Pasta primavera.

219
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:44,999
<i>You know,
"primavera" is Italian for "spring."</i>

220
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,461
- No?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,923
Really, I'm terribly sorry. It's just...

222
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,388
...all of a sudden, it just hit me.

223
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,967
So you were saying,
about the script.

224
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:00,722
Right. The script.

225
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,266
Your script needs...

226
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,977
It needs...

227
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:08,653
- More jokes?
- Another ending?

228
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,481
A different name for the butler?

229
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:18,989
Maybe we should go.

230
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,331
We haven't heard his notes yet.

231
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,825
We don't know how he feels
about our work.

232
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:31,340
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

233
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,846
I can't listen to anymore of this.
The guy's losing a lung in there.

234
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,805
Hello.

235
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,012
- Hi.
- I'm Molly.

236
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,848
- I'm Jerry.
- George.

237
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,016
We're discussing our script
with your father.

238
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,852
He just read it.

239
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:55,691
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, sweetie, I'm fine.

240
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:01,370
- So you live with your mother?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,038
Divorce is very difficult,
especially on the kid

242
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,047
Of course, I'm the result of my parents
having stayed together.

243
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,377
So you never know.

244
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,295
Crapshoot.

245
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:14,211
Dad, you all right?
What's the matter?

246
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:17,387
- It's just a stomach thing.
- Yuck.

247
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,513
We're gonna have to do this
some other time.

248
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:22,768
So if you give me your number,
I'll call you later.

249
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,731
Suddenly I'm in the mood
for pasta primavera myself.

250
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,484
Get a good look, Costanza?

251
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,701
- What were you doing?
- It's not my fault. You poked me.

252
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,130
You're supposed to just
take a peek after a poke.

253
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,253
You were like you just put a quarter
in one of those metal things...

254
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,087
...on top
of the Empire State Building

255
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,753
It was cleavage.
I couldn't look away.

256
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:03,431
What, am I waiting to win an Oscar
here? This is all I have in my life.

257
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,601
Looking at cleavage is like looking
at the sun. You don't stare at it.

258
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,682
It's too risky.

259
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,270
- You get a sense of it, then look away.
- All right.

260
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:16,447
He caught me in a cleavage peek.
So big deal.

261
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:19,106
Who wouldn't look at cleavage?
She's got nice cleavage.

262
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,610
- That's why I poked.
- Why I peeked.

263
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,781
- Hi.
- Hey.

264
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:27,030
- What is with your friend Elaine?
- What?

265
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,744
She comes to my restaurant,
comes right in my kitchen...

266
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:33,329
...starts complaining
that I'm talking about her shoes.

267
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:36,384
- She did?
- Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.

268
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:38,591
I don't like people coming
into my kitchen.

269
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:41,965
I think she sneezed all
over someone's pasta primavera.

270
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:45,225
Someone might have gotten sick
because of her.

271
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,396
- Pasta primavera?
- Is that what she said?

272
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:58,563
Hey, she's something, huh? She's
a wild one. She's wearing me out.

273
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:01,232
- She is?
- She's real sensual.

274
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,245
You know, with the cooking and all.

275
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,665
Hello?

276
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,251
Hi, Stu.

277
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:17,167
- From NBC?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:19,134
What's going on?

279
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,257
What? Really?

280
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,341
Oh, my God.

281
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,723
Did he give you a reason?

282
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,300
Oh, boy.

283
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:31,100
Okay. All right. Thanks.

284
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,931
Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot.

285
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:39,443
If you hadn't gone there,
this wouldn't have happened.

286
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:42,450
I don't like people talking about
my shoes behind my back, okay?

287
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,445
My shoes are my business.

288
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,953
You two shouldn't have been looking
at some 15-year-old's cleavage.

289
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:51,124
- He poked me!
- There was cleavage in the area.

290
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:55,120
That's a reflex.
Cleavage, poke. Cleavage, poke.

291
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,125
But she was 15.

292
00:15:57,382 --> 00:16:00,052
You don't consider age
in the face of cleavage.

293
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:03,753
This occurs on a molecular level.
You can't control it.

294
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,758
We're like some kind of weird fish...

295
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:08,554
...where the eyes operate
independently of the head.

296
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:11,218
What's the difference?
What are we gonna do now?

297
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,852
He won't take our calls.
We can't get into his office.

298
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,687
You know what we could do?
He eats at Pfeiffer's.

299
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,861
We can have Gail call us when he's
there, go there and talk to him.

300
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,486
- You're on to something.
- The whole thing is so stupid.

301
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:26,074
Like he wouldn't do the same thing
if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

302
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,991
- Well, maybe not Elaine, but...
- No.

303
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:31,374
- Somebody like Gail, though.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,997
What? What do you mean Gail?

305
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,580
What?

306
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,541
Hey, Kramer, listen, I want you
to ask Gail to do me a favour.

307
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,586
The next time Russell Dalrymple
comes in the restaurant...

308
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,046
- ...ask her if she would call me.
- All right, I'll call her right now.

309
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,850
What do you mean Gail?

310
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:52,766
You don't think I can attract attention,
put asses in the seats?

311
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:57,854
Look, sweetheart,
you know you've got it all.

312
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,728
But let's face it...

313
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:01,897
- She said she'll do it.
- All right.

314
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,525
- Great. Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

315
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,027
But she wants the shoes.

316
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,774
- What?
- She says she wants those shoes.

317
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:10,444
She wants my shoes?

318
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:12,366
What kind of person is this?

319
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,206
- She is not getting them.
- Come on, I'll buy you another pair.

320
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,999
No, these were the last pair
of these that they had.

321
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,292
- I'll get you another just like it.
- But these were the only cool ones.

322
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,967
Don't you see how everybody likes
them and everybody talks about them?

323
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,474
Elaine...

324
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:38,266
...this pilot, it doesn't matter to me.
It's not me I'm concerned about...

325
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:42,644
...it's my mother. She's already been
in the hospital this year.

326
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,822
- Yeah, because she caught you-
- Never mind!

327
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:49,194
Oh, come on. Wait a second.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

328
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,492
How do I even know she wears
the same size?

329
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,154
- All right, what size are you?
- Seven and a half.

330
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,791
Bingo.

331
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,506
Sauce this.

332
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:11,510
Yeah, he's here.

333
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:16,269
Oh, and one more thing,
bring the shoes.

334
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,315
Hey, will you look!

335
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:29,863
Fancy meeting you here.

336
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,695
Hello.

337
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,204
Pasta primavera. Back on the horse.

338
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,828
It's funny, after the pilot got cancelled,
we hadn't heard from you.

339
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,170
- We didn't hear anything.
- We were wondering what happened.

340
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,172
Well, it just didn't seem to be
the right project for us right now.

341
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,519
So, what were you saying?

342
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,394
The show. Because if it had anything
at all to do...

343
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,561
...with what you perceived as me...

344
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,738
...leering at your daughter,
I really have to take issue with that.

345
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:11,398
- I did not leer. Did I leer?
- No leer.

346
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:15,072
Excuse me.

347
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:18,497
- Are you using that ketchup?
- No.

348
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,924
Because if I'm looking...

349
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:30,508
...straight ahead and something
enters my field of vision...

350
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,004
...that's merely a happenstance.

351
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,841
Look, under the circumstances...

352
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:38,599
...I don't really feel that we should be
in business together.

353
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,848
Here's your ketchup back.

354
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:45,187
You know, I had the hardest time
trying to get some out. I just kept...

355
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,768
...pounding and pounding
on the bottom of it.

356
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,437
- Do you ever have any trouble?
- No.

357
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,784
Do you have a ketchup secret?

358
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,447
No...

359
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,454
Don't have a ketchup secret.

360
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,831
Because if you do have
a ketchup secret...

361
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,872
...I would really, really like to know
what it is.

362
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,102
Field of vision, huh?

363
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:23,011
How's everything?

364
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,478
- Really good.
- This pasta primavera is fabulous.

365
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,817
- Very tasty.
- How did it go with that NBC guy?

366
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:30,944
Great. Pilot is back on.

367
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,736
In fact, Elaine's going out
with him tomorrow night.

368
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,161
Hey, listen, Elaine...

369
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,820
...if Russell mentions anything
about the pilot...

370
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:42,536
...you'll, of course,
tell him how much you liked it.

371
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,837
You know I happen to have the script
right here with me...

372
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:49,128
...and on page three, for example...

373
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:52,419
...suppose the Elaine character
comes in wearing...

374
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:54,005
...a low-cut dress...

375
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,675
...and the butler is very distracted
and can't work.

376
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,558
That kind of comedy,
that's a little broad for us.

377
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,145
I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

378
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,056
- Well, it's a funny idea.
- It's funny.

379
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,192
- Come on, funny is funny.
- Funny's funny.

380
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:12,568
We're here to entertain, right?

381
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:14,907
All right.

382
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:17,572
Well, maybe I'll mention it
to Russell tomorrow night.

383
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,784
- If you can.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:22,790
- Where is he taking you, by the way?
- Bouchard's, on 53rd.

385
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:32,001
I think what he's trying to say is,
"Get the bouillabaisse."

386
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,932
Men are obsessed with cleavage,
women are obsessed with shoes.

387
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,894
It's the same for both sexes.
It doesn't matter...

388
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,061
...how many times
we've seen these things.

389
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,030
Every time these objects
are presented to us...

390
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:57,238
...we have to look.
We cannot not look.

391
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,982
To men,
cleavage is like the nearest thing...

392
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:02,913
...to a nearby UFO landing.
That's what it is.

393
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,830
Women, if women buy a pair
of shoes that they really love...

394
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:09,409
...this is like boarding the alien ship.

395
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,414
It's possible that aliens
have landed...

396
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,081
...and they haven't been able
to get our attention...

397
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,750
...because we're so preoccupied
with cleavage and shoes.
