1
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:06,260
You don't wanna visualize
your parents having sex.

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:08,259
It's somehow very uncomfortable.

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:13,096
You know they had to have sex
at least once to have you.

4
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,846
But you still kind of maintain
the image in your head:

5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:19,311
"Well, I don't know. I'm not positive.
I can't prove it.

6
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,361
I don't know if that
actually happened."

7
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:24,734
That's why if I found I was adopted,
that would come as great news.

8
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,238
"I'm adopted? That's great."

9
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,902
I'd be happy to hear that.
That means technically...

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,825
...it's possible, that my mother and
father are just really great friends.

11
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,038
Sex is great, but you don't wanna
think your whole life began...

12
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,048
...because somebody had a little
too much wine with dinner.

13
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,050
Let me ask you a question.

14
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,515
You're a hostage captured
by terrorists.

15
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,594
- Who, me?
- You, anybody. Whatever.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,522
You're in the little room.
You're chained to the floor.

17
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,433
You're there for a long time.

18
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,815
Do you think they would consider
doing laundry?

19
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,062
They have to.
It's in the Geneva Convention.

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,943
You. Take off your socks
and pants. We're doing the wash.

21
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:07,572
Come on. Take it off.
Take it off.

22
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,740
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

23
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,286
What's the matter?

24
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,086
My mother caught me.

25
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,380
Caught you? Doing what?

26
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:22,292
You know.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,842
I was alone...

28
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:30,550
You mean-?

29
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,765
- She caught you?
- Where?

30
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,469
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

31
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,521
...and I went inside
for a few minutes.

32
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,776
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

33
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:46,073
<i>My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.</i>

34
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,075
<i>Glamour?</i>

35
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:52,323
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?

36
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:56,329
First she screams, "George, what are
you doing? My God!"

37
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,913
Looked like she was gonna faint.

38
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:02,004
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

39
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,091
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

40
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,169
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.

41
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,173
- So she fell?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,340
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

43
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:16,009
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.

44
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:20,101
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, " My back, my back!"

45
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,351
I picked her up. I took her
to the hospital.

46
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,977
- How is she?
- She's in traction.

47
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:27,815
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.

48
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,695
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

49
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:34,119
Her back went out. She's gotta be
there for a couple of days.

50
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,200
All she said on the way over
in the car was, "Why, George, why?"

51
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:41,868
I said, " Because it's there."

52
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,292
<i>Glamour?</i>

53
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,713
I'll tell you this, though:

54
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,879
I am never doing...

55
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,847
...that again.

56
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:55,507
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

57
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:58,140
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.

58
00:02:58,313 --> 00:02:59,890
Yeah, right.

59
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:02,848
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.

60
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,860
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.

61
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,981
Care to make it interesting?

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,529
Sure. How much?

63
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,030
Hundred dollars?

64
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,532
You're on.

65
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,825
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

66
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,583
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

67
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,584
I want in on this.

68
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:29,541
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.

69
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,047
- It's different.
- Why? Why?

70
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,880
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?

71
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:36,840
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

72
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,687
It's part of our lifestyle.

73
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,272
It's like shaving.

74
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,561
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

75
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,110
Not every day.

76
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,906
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:54,240
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

78
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,450
No. A thousand.

79
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,112
No. I'll put up 150.

80
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,291
- All right. You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.

81
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,788
How we gonna monitor this?

82
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:06,625
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

83
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:08,624
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable...

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,382
...within the confines
of the honour system.

85
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,637
All right. Come on.

86
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:24,523
No, Ma. I'm not gonna
see a psychiatrist.

87
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,313
I don't care if you do pay for it.

88
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,394
No. Discussion over.

89
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,444
Yeah, all right. I'll see you later.

90
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:34,283
Yes, of course I'm gonna come by.

91
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,490
All right.

92
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,578
My mother wants me
to see a psychiatrist now.

93
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,832
Why? Because she caught me?

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,330
You know, if everyone who did
that had to go see a psychiatrist...

95
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,338
Yeah...?

96
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,345
Whatever.

97
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,638
- How is she?
- Fine. I gotta see her at the hospital.

98
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,353
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

99
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,849
Come on up.

100
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:07,774
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Date with Marla.

101
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,935
- Oh, the virgin?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,687
Any progress there?
What's the latest?

103
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,022
I got my troops amassed
along the border.

104
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,524
I'm waiting for someone to give me
the go-ahead.

105
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:21,197
Look at this. Come here. There's
a naked woman across the street.

106
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,248
Where?

107
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,251
Second floor from the top.
See the window on the left?

108
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,289
Who walks around
the house like that?

109
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:32,299
Maybe she's a nudist. You know those
nudist-colony people.

110
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,210
Yeah.

111
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,714
Yeah.

112
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,429
Let me ask you,
in these nudist colonies...

113
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,479
...do they eat naked
in the dining room?

114
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,144
I would imagine it's all naked.

115
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,061
Are the chambermaids naked too?

116
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,154
They're naked. The gardener's naked.
Bellhops.

117
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,362
It's one big nude-o-rama.

118
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,070
Well, where's my money?
Who caved?

120
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,040
- Not me.
- Not me.

121
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:09,044
- What are you looking at?
- A naked woman across the street.

122
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,756
This is gonna be the easiest
money I've ever made in my life.

123
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:17,258
My friend Joyce is teaching an
aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.

124
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:20,263
Yeah, well, the waitress
should've taken it back.

125
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:30,430
Then, I got a call this morning. I was
chosen to go on the space shuttle.

126
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:34,486
- We're going to Mars.
- Have a good time.

127
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,276
I'm out.

128
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,421
What?

129
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,879
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.

130
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,710
- You're out?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,378
Wow, that was fast.

132
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:05,226
Well, it was that woman
across the street.

133
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:08,394
You know, you better be careful,
buddy. She'll get you next.

134
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:14,645
And then there were three.

135
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:20,108
I don't understand you. I really don't.

136
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:25,821
You have nothing better to do
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

137
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,158
I go out for a quart of milk.

138
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,955
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

139
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:34,500
...like it was an amusement park.

140
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,502
Ma...

141
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,296
Don't give me " Ma. " It's good
I didn't hit the table.

142
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,427
I could have cracked my head open.

143
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,764
People can hear you.

144
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,806
Too bad you can't do that
for a living.

145
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,937
You'd be very successful at it.

146
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,942
You could sell out
Madison Square Garden.

147
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,352
Thousands of people
could watch you.

148
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,438
You could be a big star.

149
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,737
All right. That's enough.

150
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,616
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.

151
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,825
No! I am not going
to see a psychiatrist!

152
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:09,487
- Why not? Why won't you go?
- Because I don't want to.

153
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,659
- I want you to go see somebody.
- Well, I am not going.

154
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,829
It's a good thing
your father's in Chicago.

155
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,294
Hello, Aunt Estelle.

156
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:22,962
- Look at you. How did this happen?
- Is that important, really?

157
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:26,221
What is this, a police investigation?
She's been through enough.

158
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,015
She has to relive the experience?

159
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,384
Hi, Denise. 6:30, time for
your sponge bath.

160
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,978
Is it 6:30 already? I fell asleep.

161
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,107
So, George...

162
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:45,698
...what are you doing now?

163
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:50,197
I hear you got some kind of
television writing thing.

164
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:51,701
Yeah. Television.

165
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,994
Let me help you off with that.
Here, just slip it over your head.

166
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,336
Well, it's about time.

167
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:02,373
We thought you were gonna
wind up on the street.

168
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,924
So...

169
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,302
...what is it you're doing, exactly?

170
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:17,890
George, your cousin Shelly
is talking to you!

171
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:25,568
So when was the last time
you took a class?

172
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,864
- It's been a while.
- Are you psyched?

173
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,736
Yeah. I'm really psyched.

174
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,906
You'll thank me
for getting you in here.

175
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,371
- Why is that?
- See the guy with the dark hair...

176
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,784
...and the red shorts?

177
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,539
Oh, my God.

178
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,873
John F. Kennedy Jr. is here.

179
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,720
- He's gonna be in your class today.
- In my class?

180
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,464
John Kennedy will be in my class?

181
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,796
I can get you a spot
right behind him.

182
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:52,429
He has got a great butt.

183
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,979
Yeah. Butt, butt.
Great butt. John-John's butt.

184
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:04,268
- Let's slow it down a little.
- Slow it down?

185
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,653
Well, you know.

186
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:09,611
Yeah. I know.

187
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,034
You're okay with that, right?

188
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,664
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

189
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:18,830
You think I care about the sex? What
kind of person do you think I am?

190
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,754
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't care about that.

191
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,671
- I'll see you Saturday night, then?
- Sure. Saturday night.

192
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:28,927
- All right, then. Good night.
- Good night.

193
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:33,137
Not just a good night.
A great night.

194
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,880
Good morning.

195
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:07,002
Yeah, good morning.

196
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:09,501
Nothing like some good,
solid sack-time.

197
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,173
She's not there.

198
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:12,889
She's doing her wash.

199
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,799
So did you make it
through the night?

200
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,802
Yes, I'm proud to say I did.

201
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,432
So you're still master
of your domain.

202
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,813
Yes. Yes, I am.

203
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,191
Master of my domain.

204
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,321
But I will tell you this:

205
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,232
I am going over to her apartment...

206
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,733
...and I'm telling her to put
those shades down.

207
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,369
Wait. What did you just say?

208
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,363
I can't take it anymore.

209
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,448
She's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.

210
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,824
I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing walls.

211
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,911
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

212
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,163
Something's gotta give.

213
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:50,588
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hear it?

214
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,086
This is a beautiful woman
walking around naked...

215
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,924
...and you wanna tell her to stop?

216
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,554
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard!

217
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,600
It's incomprehensible-
I won't let you.

218
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,343
- I'm doing it. Get out of my way.
- No, no. You can't.

219
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,393
This is something that comes about
once in a lifetime.

220
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,856
When we were boys looking through
our windows...

221
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,195
...we'd think, "Why can't a woman
out there take her clothes off?"

222
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,236
Now that wish has come true,
and you wanna throw it away?

223
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,278
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not gonna let you do it.

224
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,412
- Kramer, get out of my way.
- Don't do it.

225
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:23,247
For my sake. God knows,
I don't ask you for much.

226
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,796
Please, Jerry. I'm begging you.
Please! Come on! Please!

227
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,010
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

228
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,047
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

229
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,136
She's not there.

230
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,636
Oh, I can wait.

231
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:48,934
The nurse was giving her
a sponge bath?

232
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:51,982
Every night at 6:30.

233
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:53,899
The nurse was gorgeous.

234
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,316
Then I got a look at the patient.

235
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,822
I was going nuts.

236
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,446
I guess you'll be going back
to that hospital.

237
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,490
Well, my mother, Jerry.

238
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,626
But are you still
master of your domain?

239
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,543
I am king of the county.

240
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,840
- You?
- Lord of the manor.

241
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:20,633
John F. Kennedy Jr.

242
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,560
What?

243
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,101
He was in my aerobics class.

244
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,230
Really? Did you talk to him?

245
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,979
No, you don't understand.
He was working out in front of me.

246
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,824
After the class was over,
I timed my walk to the door...

247
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,150
...so we'd get there
at the exact same moment.

248
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,612
And he says to me,
"Quite a workout."

249
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,746
"Quite a workout"?

250
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,786
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yeah."

251
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:48,873
Good one.

252
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,875
Listen, listen. Then I showered,
and I dressed...

253
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,958
...and I saw him again
on the way out.

254
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,918
So we're walking and talking,
and he asked me my name...

255
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:01,216
...and I think I said Elaine,
but I mean, who the hell knows?

256
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,385
So then he says to me:

257
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:08,891
"Do you wanna split
a cab uptown?"

258
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:12,359
And I said, "Sure," even though
I was going downtown.

259
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:17,902
So we get in the cab, and I mean,
I have no idea where I'm going, right?

260
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:21,408
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr.
we're talking about.

261
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,156
So he says, "Where do you live?"

262
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,738
I was close to your block,
so I said your building.

263
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,410
He dropped me off in front...

264
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:31,878
...and then I had to take a cab all
the way back downtown to my house.

265
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,626
Oh, God.

266
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,756
The question is...

267
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,466
...are you still master
of your domain?

268
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,928
I'm queen of the castle.

269
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,857
You're back.

270
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:53,650
Of course I'm back.

271
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,397
Why wouldn't I be back?

272
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:58,655
My mother is in the hospital.
I'm gonna pay her a visit.

273
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,149
I know, but two days in a row?

274
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,904
You didn't have to do this.

275
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,946
You're my mother.
What wouldn't I do for you?

276
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,452
You know what you could do?

277
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,951
I haven't eaten lunch or dinner.

278
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,370
I can't eat this hospital food.

279
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:17,046
Maybe you could run down to the deli
and get me a sandwich.

280
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,462
You got it, Ma.

281
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,380
A little later.

282
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:27,141
Could you go now, Georgie?
I'm very hungry. I'm weak.

283
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,102
Wait a while. What's the difference?

284
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:32,605
I don't understand why
you can't do this for me!

285
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:35,775
I just got here, Ma. I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

286
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:38,020
But if you wait, they won't
let you back in!

287
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,236
Visiting hours are almost over!

288
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,072
Ten minutes. Here.
Have some Tic Tacs.

289
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,160
Get the hell out of here.

290
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:50,123
I'm sorry you came.

291
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,294
6:30. Time for your bath.

292
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:02,553
George. I'm hungry.

293
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:06,056
Hang on, Ma. Hang on.

294
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:14,936
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:17,350
Did you get your hair done today?

296
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,146
No, I just fixed it a little bit.

297
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:23,316
You-know-who isn't here.

298
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,698
He was in the early class today,
but I think...

299
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:28,325
...you made quite an impression
on him yesterday.

300
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,988
What? What? Who? Me?

301
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,040
- What impression?
- Let me put this back.

302
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,045
No, no, now! Tell me now!
What did he say?

303
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:38,087
- He asked about you.
- He asked about me?

304
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,629
John Kennedy asked about me?
What did he say?

305
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,378
He wanted to know your situation.

306
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,878
- I have a situation?
- I said you were single.

307
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,222
- That was good. That was very good.
- He said you were his type.

308
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:52,721
Okay. You're trying to hurt me?
You're trying to injure me?

309
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:56,846
He told me to tell you he'll be in your
neighbourhood tomorrow around 9:00.

310
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:00,691
He'll stop in front of your building if
you wanna come down and say hello.

311
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,567
All right, Ma.
I'll talk to you later.

312
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:12,490
<i>Nothing. I'm watching
Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.</i>

313
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,082
I like kids' shows. They have a very
innocent, wholesome quality.

314
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,744
Okay. All right, talk to you later. Bye.

315
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,875
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
That's very, very good.

316
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,091
It's hot in there, so just walk around.

317
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:29,094
Yeah. Don't be ashamed.
Don't be ashamed. That's good.

318
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,223
Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,520
<i>The woman across the block
Has nothing on</i>

320
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,270
<i>Nothing on, nothing on</i>

321
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,398
<i>The woman across the block
Has nothing on, nothing on</i>

322
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:44,900
<i>All through the day</i>

323
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:05,468
All you got is instant coffee?
Why don't you get some real coffee?

324
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:09,633
I don't keep real coffee here.
I get my coffee on the outside.

325
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,261
Yeah!

326
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,842
<i>- It's Elaine.
- Come on up!</i>

327
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,679
- Where did you get those socks?
- I don't know.

328
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:20,478
- I think those are my socks.
- How are these your socks?

329
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,442
I don't know, but those are my socks.

330
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:26,276
I had a blue-striped pair just like that,
and now I don't have them anymore.

331
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:30,149
Yeah, you fell asleep on the sofa,
and I took them off your stinking feet!

332
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,236
They looked so good,
I had to have them!

333
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,738
- Well, they're my socks!
- They're my socks!

334
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,414
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- What are we doing here?

335
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,290
- This is ridiculous.
- You believe this? We're fighting.

336
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,669
I haven't been myself.
I'm snapping at people.

337
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,750
I'm yelling at strangers
on the street.

338
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,965
Hello.

339
00:18:58,522 --> 00:18:59,850
You caved?

340
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:02,348
- It's over?
- You're out?

341
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:06,820
Oh, my God.
The queen is dead.

342
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:11,274
I figured you'd cruise,
at least through the spring.

343
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:14,201
- What happened?
- It was...

344
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,200
...John-John.

345
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,332
- John-John.
- John-John.

346
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,210
You made it through
the day before.

347
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:27,373
But he told Joyce that he wants to
meet me outside here at 9:00 tonight.

348
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:30,042
- Why outside here?
- Because he thinks I live here.

349
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,387
Remember the cab? He dropped me off
out front. He's picking me up.

350
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,055
All right, Costanza...

351
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,601
...it's you and me.

352
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,221
And then, there were two.

353
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,350
Elaine Benes...

354
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:47,231
...Kennedy Jr.

355
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,323
Let's go in the bedroom.

356
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,573
- Really?
- Yes.

357
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,623
- You sure?
- Yes.

358
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,747
- You really want to?
- I do. I'm ready.

359
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,417
Okay.

360
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,591
I know how difficult this
must have been for you.

361
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:12,508
You don't know the half of it.

362
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,217
- What do you mean?
- It's kind of silly, but-

363
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,056
Contest? A contest?

364
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,107
This is what you do
with your friends?

365
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:30,444
It was just a bet. It actually started
with George and his mother.

366
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:32,903
I don't wanna hear
another word!

367
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:36,075
To think how close I came to you
being the one!

368
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:38,782
I must have been out of my mind.

369
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,214
Marla.

370
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,380
Hi.
I'm glad I ran into you.

371
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,890
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you or your perverted friends.

372
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,640
Get away from me.
You're horrible, horrible. All of you.

373
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:10,652
- What happened?
- I told her about the contest.

374
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,814
Boy. She's a wacko.

375
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:16,282
- Hey, what happened?
- What?

376
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,444
- You were meeting Kennedy.
- He didn't show.

377
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,114
Yeah, he did.

378
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:22,115
What? He's out there?

379
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,746
- Oh, my God. I gotta go.
- No, no, he just left.

380
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:28,207
- What?
- He was talking to Marla.

381
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,708
Marla?

382
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:32,882
She was, like, crying.
He was consoling her.

383
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,922
She got into his car,
and they just drove away.

384
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:41,178
- He left with Marla, the virgin?
- Yeah.

385
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,140
- They drove away?
- Yeah, drove away.

386
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:49,983
- You know, I said hello to him. He's-
- Oh, my God in heaven.

387
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,396
Is that...?

388
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,482
Kramer?

389
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:03,744
He's waving.

390
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,717
Oh, John...

391
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:27,599
...that was wonderful.

392
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:39,738
Men wanna see women naked.

393
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,701
Whatever it is you won't show us...

394
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,195
...that's what we're obsessed
with seeing.

395
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:47,658
If women always wore hats in public,
all the time...

396
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,910
<i>...you'd see men buying
Playhead magazine...</i>

397
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,412
<i>...you know, Skulls of the Big 10.</i>

398
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,747
This would be what we're
interested in.

399
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:57,213
<i>What about cultures,
in National Geographic...</i>

400
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:59,420
...where everybody is naked?

401
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:03,047
What are men in these cultures trying
to look at when the women walk by?

402
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,016
How could you have a strip
club there?

403
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:09,052
Woman takes off the necklace and
the nose ring, that's it, show's over.

404
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:13,647
The men are going, " Boy, did you see
that little indentation in her lip?

405
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,977
I told you, man, this place is hot."
