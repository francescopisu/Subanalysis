1
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,212
My parents had two arguments
while driving...

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,060
...over either how fast
my father was going...

3
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:11,303
...or how much gas
was left in the tank.

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,433
My father had a standard defence
for either one of these.

5
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:19,068
It was always, "That's because
you're looking at it from an angle.

6
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,698
If you were over here-
It looks from where you're sitting...

7
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,200
...it looks like
I'm doing 90 on empty.

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,072
But that's because
you're over there.

9
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,371
If you were over here, you'd know
I'm in the driveway with a full tank."

10
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,924
George and I went up to NBC and
told them the idea for the series.

11
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,846
- We're waiting to sign the contract.
- They liked the idea?

12
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,421
- Yeah.
- What, you got leather seats here?

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,470
- Since when is George a writer?
- What writer? It's a sitcom.

14
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:54,266
This is exciting. When are
you gonna sign the contract?

15
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,850
Soon. There's a few problems.

16
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,016
I wanna tell you,
that meal was the worst.

17
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,067
What do you expect?
It's airline food.

18
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,565
They give you that fish.

19
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,315
How could you
eat fish on a plane?

20
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,241
She puts up a stink every time
I have a piece of meat.

21
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,737
What kind of problems?

22
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,610
Well, George doesn't think
$13,000 is enough money.

23
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,199
What? He's not even working.

24
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:15,458
George is right. Those people
will try to get away with murder.

25
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:17,453
Believe me, they're all crooks.

26
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,630
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

27
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,468
George is out with the woman
from NBC right now.

28
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,846
So I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

29
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:33,094
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

30
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,978
Are you and Jerry
in agreement on this?

31
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:40,725
Yeah, we've talked. I believe I can
speak for the both of us on this.

32
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:45,608
You know, because this is your
first show, it's a pretty standard deal.

33
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:48,815
- Standard?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,117
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?

35
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>- Ted Danson?
- You know, the guy from Cheers.</i>

36
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,912
Yeah, I know who he is.

37
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:59,085
You're not Ted Danson.

38
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,163
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,088
- All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
- You tell Russell.

40
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:09,173
Oh, before I forget.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,932
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

42
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,602
Do I have to write him
a note or something?

43
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,560
- I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
- What would I say in it?

44
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,106
You're a writer.
You'll think of something.

45
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:30,068
Oh, yeah. I'm a writer. I forgot.

46
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,111
Were you waiting
long at the gate?

47
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,529
I don't even know.

48
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:37,913
Where's that watch we bought you?

49
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,620
Oh...

50
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,952
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

51
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,668
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

52
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,714
It's being fixed.

53
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:50,300
I got a guarantee on that watch.
Give it to me. I'll take it back.

54
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,381
- It's at the jeweller.
- Send me the bill.

55
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:53,885
I'm not sending it.

56
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:57,178
That watch was a gift.
You shouldn't have to pay for it.

57
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:59,512
- That's $18.50.
- Here, I got it.

58
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,180
What are you talking about?
It's my car. Let me pay.

59
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,769
- No, no, put it away.
- Dad.

60
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:06,019
- Stop it.
- I have money. I make money.

61
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:09,979
- Yeah, yeah, you make money.
- You don't think I make money.

62
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,731
- I don't think that.
- Yes. That's what you both think.

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,737
- I'm paying.
- Dad, I'm paying.

64
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:16,241
- Get out.
- You're not paying.

65
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:19,249
- Jerry, do not do this.
- No, no.

66
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,990
Over my dead body, Jerry.
I'm telling you right now...

67
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,498
...you're not gonna do it.

68
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,750
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here.

69
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:33,260
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Nothing, nothing.

70
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,388
Leave it. What about your back?

71
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:38,014
- Morty, what are you doing?
- All right, all right.

72
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,095
You come here
to see a back specialist...

73
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,762
...and you're lifting heavy suitcases.

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,767
Hey, Morty.

75
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,153
Hey, Mr. Kramer.

76
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,610
- Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld.
- Kramer, hi.

77
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:53,612
What happened to you?

78
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,240
Oh, some guy kicked me
in the side of the head.

79
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,951
- What guy?
- Crazy Joe Davola.

80
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,365
- Why?
- Well, I was having this party...

81
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:05,622
...and I didn't invite him,
and then Jerry tipped him off.

82
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,049
Why did you tell this guy that
Kramer didn't invite him to his party?

83
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,710
I didn't know he wasn't invited.

84
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:16,972
Hey, these are very
comfortable pants.

85
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,430
You know what I paid for these,
Jerry?

86
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,974
- So why did you say anything?
- It was a mistake.

87
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:25,147
They're good around the house,
and they're good for outside.

88
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,481
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,776
I was little off last week, huh, Jerry?

90
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:34,113
But the doctor says
it's just a slight concussion.

91
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,157
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

92
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,118
He's got, like, a chemical imbalance.

93
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,613
- He needs to be on medication.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,829
He's after Jerry now.

95
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:45,702
- Kramer.
- He's what?

96
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:48,167
- He's joking.
- He's after you?

97
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,668
- No.
- Why's he after you?

98
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,299
He's not after me.

99
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:54,089
Morty, do you hear this?
Some crazy guy is after Jerry.

100
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,931
- I'll make a few phone calls.
- Who you gonna call?

101
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,426
What are you worried about?

102
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,509
I wanna know what
you did to this guy.

103
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,176
- I didn't do anything.
- You must've done something.

104
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:04,932
No, he just doesn't like me.

105
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:09,016
Doesn't like you?
How could anyone not like you?

106
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:12,107
- I know, it seems impossible.
- Doesn't-

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,940
Doesn't like you?
How could that be?

108
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,357
Ma, this may be hard
for you to understand...

109
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:19,737
...but I'm sure there are many people
who do not like me.

110
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:22,403
Jerry, don't say that.

111
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,040
- It's true.
- No, it isn't.

112
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,578
It's not true. You're a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

113
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:31,424
Everybody likes you.
It's impossible not to like you.

114
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,919
Morty?

115
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:36,046
Maybe some people don't like him.
I can see that.

116
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:39,592
- Kramer?
- Yeah, I like him.

117
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,722
Hey, Jerry, what time you got?

118
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,303
I haven't got my watch on.
It's being fixed.

119
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,516
When are you getting it back?

120
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,606
- Next week.
- Next week?

121
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:55,104
How come it's taking so long?

122
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,568
I said, how come it's taking so long?

123
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,409
I don't know. They're backed up.

124
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,118
Wait a minute.
Where did you take it?

125
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,246
- Where did I take it?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:14,586
Where did I take it?

127
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,882
To that place on Columbus...

128
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:22,056
...and 85th, okay?

129
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:24,264
What, Jimmy Sherman?

130
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,348
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know the guy.

131
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,850
I take my stuff in there.

132
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,229
I can get your watch back
by tomorrow morning.

133
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,022
No, I don't want you
to say anything to him.

134
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,271
I'd be happy to.
He's a friend of mine.

135
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,440
I'd like to follow
the regular procedures.

136
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,692
I don't want any special treatment.

137
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,822
Hey, I'm gonna get that watch back
for you by tomorrow, buddy.

138
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:47,282
- Bring me the receipt.
- I'll get that too.

139
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,296
Be right back.

140
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,385
Look, there's no watch. I threw it
in the garbage can on the street.

141
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:03,129
My parents gave it to me,
but I didn't like it.

142
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:05,430
So don't mention it again, okay?

143
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,930
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

144
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,431
Wait, wait-

145
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,641
Well, no-

146
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,525
What was that about?

147
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,272
Oh, no...

148
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:20,228
...he's got my calamine lotion.

149
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:26,078
I told him not to return it.
If he needs it, he should keep it.

150
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:30,245
He's got a thing on his ankle.

151
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,542
How could anyone not like him?

152
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,884
Hi. Morty Seinfeld.
I have a 2:00 appointment.

153
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,179
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld.
Would you please fill this out?

154
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,106
All this? This whole thing?

155
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,148
It's gonna take me 45 minutes.

156
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,351
I know, it's very long.

157
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,448
Look at this. It's a book.

158
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,487
"Employer's address."
Why do they need this?

159
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,330
I never had a back problem...

160
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:11,415
...until that night I slept
on the convertible sofa.

161
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,869
- My back was fine.
- Oh, it's not the sofa.

162
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:18,580
You stick up for that sofa
like I'm criticizing a person.

163
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,881
We got it from Sullivan's.
It's a good store.

164
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:25,548
Well, one day somebody's gonna
sleep on that thing, and we'll get sued.

165
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,799
I hope this doctor
knows what he's doing.

166
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,267
Leo says he's the best there is.

167
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:31,811
Leo.

168
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,972
I'm listening to Leo now.

169
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,683
You're lucky he got you this.
You know what the waiting list is?

170
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,731
Well, if he fixes my back,
I'll be happy.

171
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:45,199
Have you ever had
a sexually transmitted disease?

172
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,159
That's it.

173
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:52,326
Here, you got my name, you
got my address. That's enough.

174
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,917
Julie, you wanna take him back?

175
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,332
You what? You passed?

176
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,835
How could you do that?

177
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,052
Jerry, my young friend...

178
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:13,477
...you're so naïve.
You are so, so naïve.

179
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,270
You know about a few things.

180
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,933
You know about comedy...

181
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,599
...a little bit about relationships,
some baseball...

182
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:24,439
...but you're so far out of your element
here, you're embarrassing yourself.

183
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,188
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

184
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,535
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

185
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:33,242
Let me explain to you
what you just did.

186
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:37,496
There are literally hundreds of people
trying to get pilot deals with them.

187
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,008
They go with maybe five, okay?
If we pass, that's it.

188
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,586
They go to the next show.

189
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm scared.

190
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:52,096
Oh, they're not gonna do the show.

191
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:55,971
We're lucky they're even interested
in the idea in the first place.

192
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:59,231
We got a show about nothing.

193
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,437
With no story.

194
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,979
Do you think they're going, " Maybe
we should give those two guys...

195
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:09,983
...who have no experience
and no idea, more money"?

196
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:16,237
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

197
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,244
- I think you're wrong.
- We'll just see.

198
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,747
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, we will.

199
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,249
- I just said that.
- I know.

200
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,750
- Good for you.
- Good for you.

201
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,628
- You repeating everything?
- You repeating everything?

202
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,257
- Well, George is an idiot.
- Well, George-

203
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,680
All right.

204
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:38,640
All right. Let's go already!

205
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:45,101
They keep you in here a year.
They don't give a damn.

206
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,355
I could die in here.

207
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,486
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What's going on?

208
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,152
I'm in here 20 minutes.
Can somebody please help me?

209
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:59,789
- Quiet. Everyone can hear you.
- I've been waiting 20 minutes.

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,620
Well, the doctor must be busy.

211
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,832
Well, why do they make appointments
for if they can't keep them?

212
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:09,166
Look, if I did that in my business,
I wouldn't have made a nickel.

213
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,305
Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.

214
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,470
- I thought you forgot about me.
- We didn't forget.

215
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,388
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

216
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:22,849
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

217
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,524
I used to be in raincoats. I refused
to put that in any of my lines.

218
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,740
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come
this way. We need some x-rays.

219
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,780
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

220
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:40,162
Oh, hey, by the way...

221
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:43,288
...do you want a box
of Cuban cigars?

222
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:46,750
I smoked one last night.
I got nauseous.

223
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,422
No, I don't want them.

224
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:54,135
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?

225
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,384
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

226
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,887
- Yeah, Cubans.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,061
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked.
You can't buy them anywhere.

228
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,724
Castro, huh?

229
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,025
<i>- Yeah?
- Federal Express.</i>

230
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,202
Federal Express? Come on up.

231
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:20,289
Federal Express?
I'm not expecting a package.

232
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:23,458
You know what you just did?
You let a burglar in the building.

233
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,036
- You think so?
- Federal Express? Of course.

234
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,922
That's the oldest trick in the book.

235
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,463
It might not be a burglar.
It could be a murderer.

236
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,757
So you wanna just abolish
all home-package delivery?

237
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,299
Yes, it's dangerous.

238
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,310
Wait.

239
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,814
- Who is it?
- Federal Express.

240
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:49,776
Okay.

241
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,614
Hi, Kramer.

242
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,617
Oh, God.
I thought you were in California.

243
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,998
- Well, I came back for you.
- Oh, shut up.

244
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:10,501
- I missed you.
- Really?

245
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,797
- You really missed me?
- Yeah.

246
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,344
Me too, miss. I miss.

247
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:17,181
Yeah, big missing
going on around here.

248
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:18,972
Hey, I'm gonna get a match.

249
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,968
Oh, God. Whose suitcase is this?

250
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:23,812
My parents'. My father came up
to see a back specialist.

251
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:27,597
Oh, God. It's probably
from sleeping on that sofa.

252
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:30,769
- Boy, you look really great.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,195
- You lie.
- No, no, you really look great.

254
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:36,523
So tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

255
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,360
Oh, he's fine.

256
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:41,406
- Things are good?
- Yeah, you know.

257
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,369
- What?
- Did you see that?

258
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,369
Yeah, I saw it.

259
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:52,120
- What?
- It's a tell. You got a tell.

260
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,466
What tell? What's a tell?

261
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,802
When you ask about their relationship
and they touch their face...

262
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,679
...you know it's not going too well.

263
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:02,055
Go ahead. Ask me
how it's going with somebody.

264
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:07,227
- How's it going with Alice?
- Good, going good.

265
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:12,402
The higher up on the face you go,
the worse the relationship is getting.

266
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:16,947
You know, it's like: Pretty good.
Not bad. I gotta get out.

267
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,744
- How high did I go?
- You almost did the nose.

268
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:31,912
Are you eating my peanut butter out
of the jar with your disgusting fingers?

269
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,416
This is a sickening display.

270
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,083
What, I'm not eating bread now.
I'm off bread.

271
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,882
You're off bread.

272
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,884
- So, what happened? Is it over?
- No, not quite.

273
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:45,893
- Why not?
- He was my psychiatrist, you know.

274
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,350
I mean, he knows all my patterns.

275
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,476
He knows in relationships
I always find some reason to leave.

276
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,272
So he says, as my doctor,
he can't allow me do this...

277
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,196
...so he's not letting me leave.

278
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,948
- What do you mean, not letting you?
- He has this power over me, okay?

279
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,488
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

280
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:08,369
He's like a Svenjolly.

281
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,953
Svengali.

282
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:14,750
- What did I say?
- Svenjolly.

283
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,290
Svenjolly? I did not say, Svenjolly.

284
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:20,378
- George?
- Svenjolly.

285
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,630
I don't see how
I could've said, Svenjolly.

286
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:28,350
Maybe he's got, like,
a cheerful mental hold on you.

287
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,732
- I can't find a match anywhere.
- You know what you should do?

288
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:37,067
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

289
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,981
It's not gonna work with this guy.

290
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,110
You just tell him an old boyfriend's
come back into your life.

291
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,659
I don't think so.

292
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:46,152
- Nice try.
- Took a shot.

293
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:48,329
This is a good cigar.

294
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,505
So when do I get to see the doctor?

295
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,717
He'll be in with the x-rays
in a few minutes.

296
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:08,849
You can get dressed.

297
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:21,185
He stole my wallet.
The bum stole my wallet.

298
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:25,864
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

299
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,743
I had my wallet in my back pocket.
It's gone.

300
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,705
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

301
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:34,290
I get my x-rays. Somebody takes
my wallet. Is that the operation?

302
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,498
Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow.
I've been going over your x-rays.

303
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:40,674
I'm not interested in the x-rays.
I want my money back.

304
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,879
Somebody stole my wallet.
I had $225 in there.

305
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:46,545
- I don't see how that happened.
- Oh, you don't see.

306
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,890
You don't see.
Well, it happened. Believe me.

307
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,385
- What's going on?
- They stole my wallet.

308
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,804
- What?
- Yeah, while I was in getting x-rayed.

309
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,307
Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry
about your wallet.

310
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,477
Would you like me
to look over the x-rays?

311
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,856
- What kind of joint you running here?
- All right.

312
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,490
Fine.

313
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,365
At least you could've
heard your diagnosis.

314
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:10,241
I'm not interested in his diagnosis.
He's a bum.

315
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:12,406
You came from Florida to see him.

316
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:16,581
I wanna know what kind of office this
is where you can't leave your pants.

317
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,580
You tell me.

318
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,967
I'm sorry,
but there's somebody else.

319
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,970
Well, it's nothing I planned
on happening, you know.

320
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:34,350
It just kind of happened.

321
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,605
- Tell me about him.
- Well, there's not really much to tell.

322
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,445
You know, he's just a guy, really.

323
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:45,194
- Yes, well, I assume he's a guy.
- Right.

324
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,524
And you've known him how long?

325
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,617
Years. Many years.

326
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:56,118
We've been close friends, and then
recently, something just, you know...

327
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,084
...happened.

328
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:02,130
- You mean sexually?
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,881
Sexually.

330
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,761
I think your...

331
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:17,471
Excuse me. Yes?

332
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:20,015
Oh, yes, Bobo.

333
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,481
No, it's just east of Madison.

334
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:27,030
Around 4 will be fine.
All right, Bobo, see you then.

335
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:31,609
I'm sorry. Where were we?

336
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:36,165
Well, I was just telling you
about this other guy.

337
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,501
Elaine, do you remember
your dream...

338
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,587
...where you had a sexual
encounter with a Chinese woman?

339
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,634
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:51,180
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

341
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:54,759
Oh, no. Don't concern yourself
with me, because I'm good.

342
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:59,182
I'm very good. I mean,
I'm really very, very good.

343
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,898
Elaine...

344
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,601
...have you been urinating
a lot again?

345
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:11,698
No.

346
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,194
And how often
have you been seeing...

347
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,661
I'm sorry. What is his name?

348
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:19,287
- His name?
- Yes, his name.

349
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,626
- Well, what's the difference?
- Are you afraid to tell me his name?

350
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,792
No, I just don't really see
how that's relevant.

351
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:29,335
It doesn't matter if you
don't see how. I see how.

352
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,921
His name.

353
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:34,303
I don't even know.
You wanna know his name?

354
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,965
I'll tell you his name. His name is...

355
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:38,804
...Kramer.

356
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,314
Kramer.

357
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,522
Is that his first name
or his last name?

358
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:48,821
You know, I'm really uncomfortable
talking about this.

359
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,195
- Elaine, I want you to do me a favour.
- What?

360
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,024
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

361
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:57,571
- It's very important that I speak to him.
- Oh, no, no, I can't do that.

362
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:01,243
- You can do it, and you will do it.
- No, I can't.

363
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,701
You can, and you will.

364
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,331
Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll have Kramer
give you a call.

365
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,961
So you didn't even let
the doctor treat you?

366
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,545
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

367
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:16,846
Why did you leave
your wallet in your pants?

368
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,101
What are you talking about?
What, was I supposed to hide it?

369
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,097
- You could've taken it with you.
- Yeah.

370
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:25,606
I'll be lying on an x-ray table
with my wallet in my mouth.

371
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,151
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,779
Hi, Uncle Leo.

373
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,437
I just spoke to Dr. Dembrow's son.

374
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,906
He said they almost
had to call the police.

375
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:39,903
What? I'm the one who should've
called the police. They stole my wallet.

376
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:43,118
You know how hard it was for me
to get that appointment for you?

377
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,958
You can't just walk in on this guy.
He did me a personal favour.

378
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,250
- All right, Leo.
- And you walked out without paying.

379
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:53,095
How was I supposed to pay?
I didn't have my wallet.

380
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,717
Well, I hope you send him a check.

381
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,131
- What for?
- What for?

382
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,301
This man was nice enough
to see you.

383
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:02,766
He did me a personal favour.

384
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:06,638
That's the second time you said
personal favour. Why do you say that?

385
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:09,142
- I said it once.
- Twice.

386
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,979
And Dembrow
doesn't even know you.

387
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:14,440
His son happens
to live on your floor.

388
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,823
Leo, where did you get that watch?

389
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:22,199
You know where I got this?

390
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,959
I found it in the garbage can.

391
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,002
It kept terrible time.

392
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:32,251
I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman
right here on 85th and Columbus.

393
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:35,841
Gave it to me back the next day,
works great.

394
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:40,342
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

395
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:42,973
Doesn't that watch look like
the one we gave Jerry?

396
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,272
Hey, where's the waiter?
Dad, let's have some red meat.

397
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,357
- Let's live a little.
- Let me see that.

398
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,694
Could we continue this
another time?

399
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:00,449
Don't you hate
"to be continueds" on TV?

400
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,870
It's horrible when you sense the
"to be continued" coming, you know.

401
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,745
You're watching the show.
You're into the story.

402
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,456
There's five minutes left,
and you realize:

403
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:14,090
"Hey, they can't make it.
Timmy's still stuck in the cave.

404
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,046
There's no way they wrap this up
in five minutes."

405
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,384
I mean, the whole reason you watch
a TV show is because it ends.

406
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,434
If I wanted a long boring story
with no point to it, I have my life.

407
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:31,101
A comedian can't do that, see? I can't
go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig.

408
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:33,565
Can you come back next week?"
