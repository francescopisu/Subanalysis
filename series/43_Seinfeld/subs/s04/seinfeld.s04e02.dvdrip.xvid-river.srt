1
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:05,845
<i>Last week on Seinfeld.</i>

2
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:07,558
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

3
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:09,552
<i>The Tonight Show called
and they want me...</i>

4
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:12,563
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me tickets to L.A.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,141
- You wanna go?
- A free ticket?

6
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,023
In fact, we could track down Kramer.

7
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,146
I got a very big meeting. I got people
interested in my treatment.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,064
- Pretty young thing.
- She was.

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,528
It's a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,654
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

11
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,867
Don't look. Don't look.
It's Fred Savage.

12
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:32,415
Did I frighten you?
I may look weird, but I'm just like you.

13
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:35,419
I'm just a regular guy, just trying
to make it in this business.

14
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:37,912
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

15
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:39,542
Just the trees.

16
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:42,503
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

17
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,670
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,427
I think we just caught a break.

19
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:53,603
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

20
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:59,014
So that's when I said, " Hey, Kramer,
dude, you ever kill a man before?"

21
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,067
<i>You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.</i>

22
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:02,779
- Who else is on?
- I don't know.

23
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,774
Corbin Bernsen.

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,736
<i>Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.</i>

25
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,987
I don't wanna tell you
how to run the show-

26
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:12,701
- No, of course not.
- It's enough with the bar already.

27
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:17,287
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

28
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,122
But troubled, strange.

29
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:22,962
- Let's pick up this Kramer.
- Kramer!

30
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,707
<i>Police have just released
a photo of the suspect...</i>

31
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,176
<i>...being sought in connection
with the slayings.</i>

32
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:32,132
<i>He is known only as Kramer.</i>

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,886
There are many different jobs
in the police.

34
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,640
It seems to me
that "chalk outline guy"...

35
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,901
...is one of the better jobs
that you can get.

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,771
You know, it's not too dangerous.
The criminals are long gone.

37
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,491
That seems like a good one.

38
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,110
I guess they're people that wanted
to be sketch artists...

39
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,659
...but they couldn't draw too well.

40
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,705
"Listen, Johnson,
forget the sketches.

41
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,876
Do you think if we left the body
right there on the sidewalk...

42
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,666
...you could manage to trace
around it?

43
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:04,876
Could you do that?"

44
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,174
How does that even help them
solve the crime?

45
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:09,836
They look at the thing.
"His arm was like that...

46
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,508
...when he hit the pavement.

47
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:15,301
That means the killer must
have been Jim."

48
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,646
- He's on the loose.
- Let go of my arm. You'll get us killed.

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,737
What are we supposed to do?
What do you do in this situation?

50
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,780
Should we call a lawyer
or the police?

51
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,900
Obviously, we're gonna call the police
and tell them he's not the guy.

52
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:37,488
- We hope he's not the guy.
- Couldn't be the guy.

53
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,542
God, I'm starved.
I'm weak with hunger.

54
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:44,382
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

55
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,257
A time like what? I'm hungry.

56
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,549
My stomach doesn't know
that Kramer's wanted.

57
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,879
I told you, you should
have had breakfast.

58
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,973
I couldn't have breakfast.
It was lunchtime.

59
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,383
The three-hour time difference
threw me.

60
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,396
I wanted a tuna fish sandwich.
They wouldn't serve me one...

61
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,640
...because they were only
serving breakfast.

62
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:05,730
- You should've had some eggs.
- For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?

63
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,904
Have you ever heard of egg salad?

64
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:10,907
Why didn't you say something?

65
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,867
I gotta tell you about egg salad?

66
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:16,903
I need food, Jerry. I'm feeling faint.
I'm getting lightheaded.

67
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,204
I gotta call the police.
There's a pay phone.

68
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,914
Pay phone in L.A.
Look, it's a miracle.

69
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:32,755
I have no change.
You got any change?

70
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,757
No, I don't. I never carry change.

71
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:37,305
- We need change. All I got is 20s.
- I have a 10.

72
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,350
- So break it.
- I hate asking for change.

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,521
They make a face. It's like I'm asking
them to donate a kidney.

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,813
- So buy something.
- What?

75
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,689
I don't know.
Some mints or Tic Tacs.

76
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,353
- Breath problem?
- No. I just want some change.

77
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,358
- Tell me.
- Your breath is fine.

78
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,277
It's delightful. It's delicious.

79
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:58,319
- You know, I haven't eaten anything.
- I just wanna call the police.

80
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:01,249
Why don't you just call 911?

81
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,956
- But is this an emergency?
- Of course it is.

82
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,457
How is this an emergency?

83
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,620
Your friend has been accused
of being a serial killer.

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,258
I think that qualifies.

85
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,922
All right, I'll call 911.

86
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,474
Do you think he did it?
Could he have done it?

87
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:19,718
He couldn't have done it.
How could he have?

88
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,599
Couldn't do it. Could he?

89
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,975
Hello, 911? How are you?

90
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,858
I'm sorry. Just a reflex.

91
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,859
I know it's an emergency number.
It is an emergency.

92
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,653
My friend's been accused
of being the Smog Strangler...

93
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,735
...and I know he didn't do it.

94
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,818
They're putting me through
to the detective in charge.

95
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:41,326
Making terrific headway.

96
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,168
What is my name? Who am I?

97
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:47,336
I'm George Costanza.

98
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,089
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?

99
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,463
- Why are you using my name?
- Don't be a baby.

100
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:54,635
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared of the same thing you are:

101
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:57,010
Everything. Why don't you
use your own name?

102
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,633
Your name is a good name. Costanza.
Sounds like it stands for something.

103
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,352
- They'll believe us.
- Really?

104
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,931
- Sure.
- You think so?

105
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,480
Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:09,266
Yes, I have very important information
regarding the Smog Strangler.

107
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,853
Get yourself a mint or something.

108
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,689
Can I come in right now?

109
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,442
I suppose.

110
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,451
Where are you located?
Where is that?

111
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,283
I don't know where we are.
Where are we?

112
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,163
- I don't know
- We don't know.

113
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,372
He says, "Ask somebody."
Ask that guy.

114
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,500
- Excuse me, where are we?
- Earth.

115
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:31,330
Hey, you know, I'm on the phone
with the police.

116
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,336
Some guy just gave me
a wise answer.

117
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:38,800
Ask that woman.

118
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:41,298
- Excuse me, what street are we on?
- I don't know.

119
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,934
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

120
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:45,640
How could you not know
what street you're on?

121
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,055
You don't know.

122
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:53,819
George, it says here on the phone.
It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard.

123
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,530
Okay.

124
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,987
Do we know where the 101 is?
No.

125
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,566
Do we know where the 170 is?
No.

126
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,903
Do we know where the 134 is?

127
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:04,831
No.

128
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,043
Okay.

129
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,912
He's gonna send a black and white
to pick us up.

130
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,165
- Black and white?
- Cop car.

131
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:17,212
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I thought it sounded cool.

132
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:20,091
- Yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
- Oh, you are.

133
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,589
I guarantee you Lupe's gonna tuck
your covers in.

134
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,594
- I'll bet you. How much?
- Her tip.

135
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,927
- You got a bet.
- Okay.

136
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:29,311
How much do you tip
a chambermaid?

137
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,854
Which one of you is Costanza?

138
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,020
Get in.

139
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,855
Hi. How are you?
Guys, listen...

140
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:43,113
...do either one of you have a mint,
or a piece of gum, or something?

141
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,836
Hey, Jerry, do me a favour.
Close your window.

142
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:02,590
Hey, get out of here.

143
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:07,972
- Hey, he's fooling around back here.
- Cut it out back there.

144
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,972
- He started it.
- I did not.

145
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:12,140
You guys gonna go through
some red lights?

146
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,976
I don't think so.

147
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,152
- But you could.
- Oh, yeah. Of course we could.

148
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,815
We could do anything we want.

149
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,825
We can drive on the wrong side
of the road.

150
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:25,444
We do that all the time. You should
see the looks on the people's faces.

151
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,122
Shoot people.

152
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,615
You guys ever shot anybody?

153
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,999
- No.
- No.

154
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,543
- Can I flip on the siren?
- Why bother them?

155
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,502
I'm just asking.
All they have to do is say no.

156
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,926
Yeah, go ahead.

157
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,726
- Check it out.
- Can I try it?

158
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,562
Yeah, go ahead. Hurry up.

159
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,273
Scared the hell out of that guy.

160
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,274
You know what I've never understood?
Why did they change the siren noise?

161
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,651
When I was a kid, it was always:

162
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:02,615
You know, and now it's:

163
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,026
Why'd they do that?
Did they do some research?

164
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,908
Did they find out "woo-woo"
is more effective than "waa"?

165
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,572
Yeah, hey, what about those
English sirens, you know?

166
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,538
Hey!

167
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:37,434
I'm dizzy.

168
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:43,072
- Nice shotgun.
- Thanks.

169
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:46,445
- Clean as a whistle.
- You could eat off that shotgun.

170
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:49,406
- What is that, a 12-gauge?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:52,458
Twelve-gauge. Seems to be
the most popular gauge.

172
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,330
- Big gauge. My favourite.
- Mine too. Love the 12-gauge.

173
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,744
Makes the 11-gauge look
like a cap pistol.

174
00:08:57,922 --> 00:08:59,914
- What do we got over there?
- What?

175
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,092
- I don't know.
- Looks like a possible 519.

176
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,467
- 519? What's a 519?
- Where?

177
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:08,259
- You think so?
- Looks like it.

178
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:12,181
- I can't believe this. A 519?
- Where? Where? I can't see.

179
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:16,600
This is car 23. We have a possible
519 in progress. Over.

180
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,099
All right. Let's pull over
and check it out.

181
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:20,901
Pull over?

182
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,398
You can't pull over.

183
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,611
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

184
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:28,032
Pull over? The lieutenant
is waiting to see us.

185
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:31,203
- Hey, hey, hey. We're in a rush here!
- We have an appointment.

186
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,411
What are you doing?

187
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:42,841
Great.

188
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:47,303
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm
cookies up there.

189
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:50,141
- What kind?
- Milano.

190
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:54,139
Cops eating Milanos?
What kind of crazy town is this?

191
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,727
- Should I take some?
- I think that's a 519.

192
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,566
I'm starving.

193
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,643
- Spread them.
- Hey, they're busting this guy.

194
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,563
They're cuffing him.

195
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:10,315
I can't believe this.

196
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,834
I can't believe that cops
still have to read...

197
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,922
...that whole "you have the right
to remain silent" speech...

198
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,669
...to every criminal they arrest.

199
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:28,548
Is there anybody that doesn't
know that by now?

200
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:31,675
<i>Can't they go, "You're under arrest.
You ever seen a Baretta?"</i>

201
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,305
"Yeah. " "Good. Get in the car."

202
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,391
Hi.

203
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:40,893
Hi, I'm Jerry.

204
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,439
George. How you doing?

205
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,487
What'd you do?

206
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,197
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

207
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:50,698
Oh, yeah, right. Me neither.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

208
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,992
Shut up.

209
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,656
- Hot out.
- Brutal.

210
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,955
What do you tip a chambermaid?

211
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,214
I don't know. Five bucks a night.

212
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:12,378
No. A dollar. Two, tops.

213
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:15,807
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed.
What are you, narcs?

214
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,096
- Narcs.
- Imagine. Us, narcs.

215
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:22,889
No, no. No, actually, we're friends
of a serial killer.

216
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,024
- Just trying to help him out.
- Really?

217
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:26,653
- Yeah.
- That's very nice.

218
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,394
- Thank you.
- Suspected serial killer.

219
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,408
- He didn't actually do it.
- Yeah, well, we don't think.

220
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,035
We're pretty sure.

221
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,869
- A dollar a night?
- Yeah. That's a good tip.

222
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,746
- That stinks.
- I read it in Ann Landers.

223
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,830
- Ann Landers sucks!
- Hey, shut up back there.

224
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,423
<i>Attention, all units. Attention, all units.
All units, code three.</i>

225
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,753
<i>All units in the area,
code three in progress.</i>

226
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,841
<i>1648 North Las Palmas. Units require
assistance in apprehension, 702.</i>

227
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,058
- That's the Smog Strangler.
- Kramer.

228
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:01,604
- They got him.
- Let's go.

229
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:19,739
We've gotta go.
Let's see what's happening.

230
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:23,118
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, man.

231
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,874
Jerry. George.

232
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,463
You're under arrest for first-degree
murder in the death of Chelsea Lange.

233
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:51,813
Why'd you do it? Why'd you do it?
People wanna know, please!

234
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,361
- What possessed you?
- Well, I don't know.

235
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,783
- Do you have any regrets?
- How are you?

236
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,629
Hey!

237
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,999
Hey!

238
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:16,966
- Hey, how you doing? Jerry! George!
- We're doing fine. How are you?

239
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,175
What? Me? Fabulous.
Just fabulous.

240
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:23,138
I got a lot of auditions,
a lot of callbacks.

241
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,470
I got a lot of interest
in my movie treatment.

242
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:28,684
You know, I'm in development.
I'm developing vehicles.

243
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:32,726
Man, there's a lot of energy here, man.
You know, the vibe, it's powerful.

244
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:36,155
I'm just swept up in it.
Yeah, I'm a player.

245
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:39,195
- You're a player?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a player.

246
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,198
Kramer, do you realize
what's going on here?

247
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,330
Do you know why you're here?

248
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,495
What, this? I'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

249
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,548
Hey, guess who I met today.
Fred Savage.

250
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,124
Oh, nice kid. A really good kid.

251
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,089
You know, we're talking about
doing a project together.

252
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:01,467
Kramer, you've been arrested
as a serial killer.

253
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,726
So? I'm innocent.

254
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:09,146
I mean, you guys believe that
I'm innocent, don't you?

255
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,151
Jerry? George?

256
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,810
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.

257
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,195
Kramer, let's go.
Lieutenant wants to see you.

258
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:20,569
Yeah, okay, yeah. All right.
Look, I'll be out of here by noon.

259
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:23,414
Hey, maybe we'll have lunch
together, huh?

260
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,991
Hey, is it all right if I talk
to them again?

261
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,080
Yeah, okay.

262
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:39,174
Help me! Oh, God, help me! Get me
out of here! George, Jerry, get me out!

263
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:41,884
Get me-!

264
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,975
I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
I swear to God!

265
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:47,682
Don't you ever swear
to my God, Kramer.

266
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:51,556
My God protects the innocent
and punishes evil scum like you.

267
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,940
- Have you got that?
- You're making a mistake.

268
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,112
No! You made a mistake, Kramer.

269
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:59,320
Sickies like you always do.

270
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:02,611
The only difference is this time
you're gonna pay.

271
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,743
You might beat the gas chamber,
Kramer.

272
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:06,621
But as long as I've got a breath...

273
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,913
...you will never see the light
of day again.

274
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:12,204
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got
the wrong man! It wasn't me!

275
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,131
Yeah, right. Maybe it was one
of your other personalities.

276
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,917
What? The wise guy, the little kid,
the bellhop, the ballplayer?

277
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:21,965
Maybe the door-to-door vacuum
cleaner salesman, but not you.

278
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,096
No, you wouldn't hurt a fly.

279
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,674
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you, Kramer?

280
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,936
You saw a life, brimming brightly
with optimism and verve...

281
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:33,059
- ...and you just had to snuff it out.
- Can I talk to somebody?

282
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,318
- You're not letting me explain!
- I don't want your explanations.

283
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,447
Sure, I bet you've got
a million of them.

284
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,740
Maybe your mom didn't love
you enough.

285
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:45,408
Maybe the teacher didn't call on you
when you had your hand raised.

286
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,948
Maybe the pervert in the park
had a present in his pants, huh?

287
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,832
Oh, I got another theory for you.

288
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,330
- You're a weed.
- No.

289
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,045
- Society's filled with them.
- No.

290
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,964
You're choking the life out
of all the pretty flowers.

291
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,840
You see something
young and pretty...

292
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,630
...you just got to choke
the life out of it, don't you?

293
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:04,473
You killed the pretty flowers,
didn't you, Kramer?

294
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,965
You killed the pretty little flowers,
didn't you?

295
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:11,010
You dirty, filthy, stinking weed!
Didn't you?

296
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,516
I...

297
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,895
Lieutenant, for you.

298
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,237
Martel. Yeah.

299
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,031
Yeah.

300
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,117
Yeah.

301
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:27,369
Yeah.

302
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,492
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Let him go.

303
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,073
- What? But, lieutenant-
- You heard me. Let him go.

304
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:34,580
Get him out of here.

305
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:37,671
They just found another body
up in Laurel Canyon.

306
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,832
Go on, Kramer. Get out of my sight.

307
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,918
How'd you know about
the guy in the park?

308
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,636
I said, beat it.

309
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:53,560
- What happened?
- Somebody got killed...

310
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,723
- ...while they had me in custody.
- Really?

311
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,683
- Hear that? Somebody else was killed.
- No kidding! Somebody else got killed?

312
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:02,317
While he was in jail.
So you're free!

313
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:07,531
Yes, I'm free because the murderer
struck again. Hey!

314
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,871
So, Kramer, what are you gonna do?

315
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,664
Do? Do?

316
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,162
Hey, I'm doing what I do.

317
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,748
You know, I've always done what I do.

318
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,752
I'm doing what I do.

319
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:27,759
The way I've always done it,
and the way I'll always do it.

320
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,007
What the hell are you talking about?

321
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,726
What do you want me to say?

322
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:34,182
Things haven't worked out
the way I've planned?

323
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,604
That I'm struggling, barely able
to keep my head above water?

324
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,348
That L.A.'s a cold place
even in the middle of summer.

325
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,477
That it's a lonely place even when
you're stuck in traffic on the freeway?

326
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,527
That I'm no better than
the screenwriter driving a cab...

327
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,070
...the starlet turning tricks, the
producer in a house he can't afford?

328
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,861
Is that what you want me to say?

329
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,917
- I'd like to hear that.
- Yeah.

330
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,492
Well, I'm not saying that.

331
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,457
You know, things are going
pretty well for me here.

332
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:04,586
- I met a girl.
- Kramer, she was murdered.

333
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,888
Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't looking
for a long-term relationship.

334
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,140
- I was on TV.
- As a suspect in a serial killing.

335
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,093
Okay, yeah, all right. You guys gotta
put a negative spin on everything.

336
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:19,640
What do they put in this tuna?
Tastes like a dill. I think it's a dill.

337
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:23,648
- So you're not coming back with us?
- No, I'm not ready, you know.

338
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,193
I mean, things are starting
to happen for me.

339
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:28,653
Taste this. Is this a dill?

340
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,071
No, it's a tarragon.

341
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,283
Listen, Kramer, I'm sorry
about that whole fight we had...

342
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,329
...about you having my apartment keys
and everything.

343
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,788
All right.

344
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,459
Okay, it's forgotten.

345
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,341
- Tarragon?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:48,586
Oh, you're crazy.

347
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,553
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.

348
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,011
Yep, take care. Stay in touch.

349
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:56,682
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, give me a hug, you guys.

350
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,020
Kramer, my sandwich.
You're crushing my sandwich.

351
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:36,134
You know, it's so nice
when it happens good.

352
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:55,702
- Mint?
- No, thanks.

353
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:59,076
I gotta tell you.
I'm really disappointed in Lupe.

354
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,168
It's been three days already.
Forget about Lupe.

355
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,754
Think she gets to take any of those
little bars of soap home?

356
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:07,251
No, I don't.

357
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,883
You'd think when they hand out the
checks, they'd throw in a few soaps.

358
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:15,138
Yeah, maybe they should throw
in a couple of lamps too.

359
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:18,890
I'll tell you, if I owned a company,
my employees would love me.

360
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:22,145
They'd have huge pictures of me
on the walls and in their home.

361
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,223
Like Lenin.

362
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,021
How much did you wind up
tipping her?

363
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:30,397
Oh, my God, I forgot.

364
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,730
That's why communism didn't work.

365
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,111
Hey!

366
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:46,371
- Got any mustard? This is empty.
- Yeah, there's a new one in there.

367
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,954
No, no. I don't like this one.
It's too yellow.

368
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,175
- Did you know he was back?
- No.

369
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,798
- Got any pickles?
- Help yourself.

370
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah. All right.

371
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,969
Kramer, what are you doing here?

372
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,345
I'm getting something to eat.

373
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,015
Kramer.

374
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,642
Here.

375
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,574
Authorities disclosed the latest
Smog Stranglings suspect...

376
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,788
...was apprehended this week
on an unrelated charge...

377
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,621
...but somehow managed to escape...

378
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:30,713
...from the police car
in which he was being held.

379
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:34,334
Tobias Lehigh Nagy,
who is also wanted...

380
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:37,547
...in connection with unrelated
slayings in the Northwest...

381
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:41,056
...is still at large,
his whereabouts unknown.

382
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:44,429
He is described as 5'5", bald...

383
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:48,305
...and reputedly
a very generous tipper.

384
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,194
The thing about L.A. to me
that kind of threw me...

385
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:54,315
...was when, you know, they have
the smog alerts out there.

386
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:58,985
And they actually recommend
that people stay indoors...

387
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:04,155
...during the smog alert.
Now, maybe I'm way off...

388
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:05,993
...but don't you think-?

389
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,955
Wouldn't you assume that the air
in the house...

390
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:14,206
...pretty much comes from the air
in the city where the house is?

391
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,795
What do they think?
We live in a jar...

392
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,093
...with a couple of holes
punched in the top?

393
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:21,802
What the hell's going on out there?
It's very strange.

394
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:25,344
Do you realize it is now possible
for parents to say to their children:

395
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,221
"All right, kids, I want you in the house
and get some fresh air.

396
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:32,898
Summer vacation.
Everybody indoors."
