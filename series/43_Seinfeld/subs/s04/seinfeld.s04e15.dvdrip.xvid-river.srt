1
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:06,221
The age-gap hiring policy
at movie theatres:

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,475
They never hire anyone
between the ages of 15 and 80.

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:12,680
Know what I mean? The girl
that sells you the tickets, she's 10.

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:15,773
Then there's the guy that rips it,
he's 102.

5
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,350
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?

6
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:21,813
It's like they want to show you
how life comes full circle.

7
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,155
You're 15. You sell tickets. You leave.

8
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,659
You go out, you have a family, kids,
marriage, career, grandchildren.

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,154
Eighty years later,
you're at the same theatre...

10
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,991
...3 feet away, ripping tickets.

11
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,918
Took you 80 years
to move 3 feet.

12
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,670
The show's delayed? Why?

13
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:44,381
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.

14
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:45,965
But I got this all timed out.

15
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:49,093
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.

16
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,473
- I hear you, guy.
- I'm doing Letterman Monday.

17
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:53,767
You know, I gotta work out
the material.

18
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:56,061
Let me see what I can do.

19
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:01,190
Oh, no, Buckles? You're not putting
him on tonight, are you?

20
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,280
No. He hangs around in case
somebody drops out.

21
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,450
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot.

22
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,568
<i>I was supposed to meet my friends
to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.</i>

23
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:15,747
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot. I'll be back.

24
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:18,291
- Hey, Jer.
- Hey.

25
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,885
Excuse me. Do you have a ticket?

26
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,678
- No.
- Okay. Good.

27
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:36,476
You missed your spot. It was 9:15.

28
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:39,139
But, Maurice, I'm positive
you told me 9:50.

29
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,900
In any event, I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot...

30
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,985
...to one of your peers who possesses
a clearer understanding...

31
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,731
...of our scheduling policies.

32
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,614
- Jerry!
- What are you doing here?

33
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,499
Hey, do you think this is funny?

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,827
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?
You don't have to be an athlete to get it.

35
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:05,501
I mean, my father gets it all the time
and, believe me, he's no athlete.

36
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:06,875
- I gotta go.
- Where?

37
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,631
- The movies.
- You told Kernis...

38
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:10,762
...you were going back
to do the 11:00.

39
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,470
I'm gonna stop by
and tell my friends I can't make it.

40
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,763
- Cool. I'll split a cab with you.
- I could be a while over there.

41
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:20,770
I got time. It'll give us a chance to
get to know each other a little better.

42
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,776
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,318
- Where is everybody?
- Everybody's late.

44
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,403
Because they know
I'll get in line early.

45
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,249
<i>I've been dying to see Checkmate.</i>

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,167
<i>Well, if it's as good as
Ponce de León, I'll be happy.</i>

47
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:43,463
<i>Ponce de León? Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.</i>

48
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,039
<i>Ponce de León?
But that was great.</i>

49
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,711
Oh, come on.

50
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:51,551
That fountain of youth scene at the end
where they're splashing around...

51
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:54,759
...and they go running to the mirror
to see if it really worked.

52
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,808
I mean, come on.

53
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:59,390
It's so stupid.

54
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,058
Let me tell you something:

55
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:04,399
When Ponce looked in that mirror
and saw that he hadn't changed...

56
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,567
...and that tear started to roll
down his cheek, I lost it.

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,566
- There you are.
- Where have you been?

58
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,865
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.

59
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:16,036
- Well, I told you the Paragon.
- No, you said Paradise.

60
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:19,242
- It's playing there too.
- No. I would not have said Paradise.

61
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,501
That's a twin theatre. I want to see
this movie on a big screen.

62
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,330
I'm gonna get a hot dog
at Papaya King.

63
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,459
- You'll never make it back in time.
- I haven't had any dinner.

64
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,293
You can get one at the theatre.

65
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,007
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,089
Jerry is gonna be here any second.

67
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,764
Then this line's gonna start moving,
and we'll end up in the front row.

68
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:40,261
- Save me a seat.
- No, I don't wanna save seats.

69
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,766
Don't put me through that.

70
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,312
I had the fleece ripped out
of my winter coat...

71
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,061
...in a seat-saving incident.

72
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:48,691
- Give me my ticket, then.
- I don't have them yet.

73
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:51,108
You don't have them yet?

74
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,907
Well, I'm in line to buy.

75
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:55,863
No, George,
this is a ticket-holders' line.

76
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,279
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.

77
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,614
- How come we're not moving?
- Good question.

78
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:05,044
Is this the ticket-holders' line
or the buyers'?

79
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:06,963
Holders'.

80
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,883
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket, you said no.

81
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,803
I didn't. My friend was getting it.

82
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,889
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.

83
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,717
Stay here. I'll go get tickets.

84
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,975
- Can you believe him?
- He spaced out.

85
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,057
And how long would you have stood in
the ticket-holders' line? Yeah, exactly.

86
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:28,610
It's sold out.

87
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,898
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.

88
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,947
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket.

89
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:36,489
- All right, what time is it?
- Twenty after 10.

90
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,784
They got one at the
Paradise at 10:45.

91
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:42,205
No, I don't wanna go to
a miniplex multi-theatre.

92
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,664
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?

93
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,164
No, it's not a theatre.

94
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:50,999
It's a room where they bring in POWs
to show them propaganda films.

95
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,254
All right, I'm going.

96
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:56,761
- It's in Dolby.
- Well, what about Jerry?

97
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,805
You get the tickets. I'll wait for him.

98
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:01,466
- Terrific. All right, come on.
- All right.

99
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:11,731
So then, when I was 12,
the whole family moved...

100
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:14,905
...from Bensonhurst
to Sheepshead Bay.

101
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,151
We were right on the water.

102
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:20,660
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.

103
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,119
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?

104
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,200
Yeah, yeah. The fishy smell.

105
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,036
To this day I won't eat fish.

106
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:30,711
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes! Yes, I eat fish!

107
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:33,373
- I don't know how you eat that crap.
- Take the Park.

108
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,754
No, no, take 55th.
No, there's beautiful homes there.

109
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:41,223
There's lovely, talented,
attractive people. You'll thank me.

110
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,717
Jerry, I want you to do me a favour:

111
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,223
No more fish.

112
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:47,514
Okay. I get your point.

113
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,018
I have a point?

114
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,860
- Got them.
- Beautiful.

115
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,023
Hey, you know what else
is playing here?

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,742
<i>Rochelle Rochelle.</i>

117
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,570
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:03,366
Men can sit through the most
pointless, boring movie...

119
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,157
...if there's the slightest possibility
that a woman will take her top off.

120
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,003
So, what's your point?

121
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,666
By the way, you owe me $7.50.

122
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,341
- All right. Can you break a 20?
- No. I don't have any change.

123
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,511
Well, then I'll pay you later.

124
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,421
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.

125
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,344
Yeah, you could.

126
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,263
Might be easier.

127
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:28,681
Well, how's that easier? I mean,
then you would owe me $12.50...

128
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,730
...instead of me owing you $7.50.

129
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,683
- Either way.
- Yeah, it's the same thing.

130
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,275
So can I have it?

131
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,447
I tell you what, I'll get
the popcorn and the soda.

132
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,202
What do you mean,
you'll get the popcorn and the soda?

133
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:50,533
I will buy your popcorn and soda,
and we'll call it even.

134
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,629
Tell you what. Give me the 20,
I'll buy you a popcorn and soda...

135
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:57,463
- ...and I'll throw in a bonbons.
- George, you're sapping my strength.

136
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,462
Come on. Go.

137
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,423
What about Kramer and Jerry?

138
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,590
I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.

139
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,257
Me? But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.

140
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,511
I told you about that guy
who tore my coat.

141
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,891
- Save them, go.
- No, but George...

142
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,398
Fifty-Fifth Street. Great idea.

143
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,781
Saturday night, theatre traffic.
Good move.

144
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,657
I wonder how Ike Turner
would react in traffic.

145
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,499
"You better move that car, girl,
before I bust you up."

146
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,204
And what about Jose Feliciano?

147
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:34,995
"It's not bad enough that I can't see,
I have to sit here for two hours.

148
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,501
I don't think so."

149
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:41,336
It can be anybody. People down
through history reacting in traffic.

150
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,172
Franklin Roosevelt:

151
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,633
- "Driver-"
- All right, all right. I got the bit.

152
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:50,143
Jerry, I want you to have
this piece of material.

153
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:52,186
That's nice of you. I can't do voices.

154
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,349
Jerry, don't start up with me.

155
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,482
I gotta get out of this cab.

156
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,230
But, Jerry, we're riffing.

157
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:03,399
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring.
Do you understand the difference?

158
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:07,365
<i>Can you help me
get on The Tonight Show?</i>

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,956
- No, these are saved.
- All of them?

160
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,666
- You can't take four seats.
- What, is that a rule?

161
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,219
- Are these your things?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,009
I can't wait anymore.
I'm gonna miss the beginning.

163
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:29,302
Well, we'll take these seats.
Would you please remove your stuff?

164
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:32,181
- No, no, they'll be here.
- But I am here. They are not.

165
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,810
They're coming. Listen,
run over to the Paragon...

166
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,604
...and give Kramer the two tickets
so they can come in.

167
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,319
These are taken. Taken.

168
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,693
If you hurry,
you won't miss the beginning.

169
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,526
You go, and I could save the seats.
You don't like saving anyway.

170
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:49,824
No, taken! Taken, taken.
I'm getting the hang of it.

171
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,571
Why don't you give me the 20,
I'll stop and get change...

172
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,789
...and then you and I can settle up.

173
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,336
Can we do this later, George?

174
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,337
What's the point of discussing it.

175
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,258
You'll give me the money
when you have it.

176
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,672
I trust you.

177
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:20,436
Will you do me a favour? You see a guy
who's about 5 foot 11...

178
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,936
...he's got a big head
and flared nostrils...

179
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:25,901
...tell him his friend's gonna be
right back, okay?

180
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,535
No, I'm sorry. These are taken.

181
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,408
They're in the lobby buying popcorn.

182
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,408
What are you doing?
These are taken!

183
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,956
- Which one?
- These two and this one.

184
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:41,042
No, don't come over here! These
are taken. Go! Go! These are taken.

185
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,967
They're taken! They're taken!

186
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,627
Oh, take them.

187
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,387
Excuse me, have you seen a guy with...

188
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:59,730
...a horse face, big teeth
and a pointed nose?

189
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,148
- Flared nostrils?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,146
Nope. Haven't seen him.

191
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,914
Jerry, could you do me
a personal favour?

192
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,083
And if I'm out of line,
please let me know.

193
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:21,917
Could I keep my trench coat
in your closet for a few months?

194
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,583
Your trench coat in my closet?

195
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,130
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills.

196
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,010
I'm afraid to open the door.

197
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,756
Just for a few months.

198
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,006
It'll make all the difference
in the world.

199
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,009
I can't keep your coat in my closet.

200
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,676
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- That's how I feel.

201
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:39,641
Hey, your friends aren't here.

202
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,559
They must be inside. I'm gonna run in,
tell them I can't make the movie.

203
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:47,436
<i>We should go see Rochelle Rochelle.
I hear it's really hot.</i>

204
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:50,532
- No, thanks. Some other time.
- Really? Do you mean that?

205
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,363
No, I don't.

206
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,778
But you like the athlete's-foot bit,
right?

207
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,122
No. No. I was kidding.
It was terrible.

208
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,751
Here you go. See you later.

209
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,125
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. Don't wait.

210
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,332
Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure
you get in, that's all.

211
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,796
I got friends inside
I need to get a message to.

212
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,008
You mind if I walk through
real quick?

213
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,138
Go ahead.

214
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,133
Bye-bye.

215
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,551
Hey, did that guy show up?

216
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,894
The guy with the horse face
and the big teeth?

217
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,471
No, the guy with the big head
and flared nostrils.

218
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,767
Haven't seen him.

219
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,900
There was a short guy with glasses...

220
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,238
...looked like Humpty-Dumpty
with a melon head.

221
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,068
But he left.

222
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:38,164
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

223
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,123
I mean, he's 12 years old.

224
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,412
Who else but my Alan
would do something like that?

225
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:47,122
And then last night,
he put on my high heels.

226
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,091
He put on such a show for us.

227
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,344
<i>He was dancing around,
lip-synching to A Chorus Line.</i>

228
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:56,297
- I mean, you can see he's got talent.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

229
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,934
What's the problem?

230
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,513
You're talking.

231
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:02,438
It's the coming attractions.

232
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:05,144
So anyway, he sings, he dances.

233
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:07,061
You know what he's gotten into now?

234
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,941
He is cooking. He does a great-

235
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,442
Ticket, sir?

236
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,073
I just went out.
I went to look for my friend.

237
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,530
- Do you have your stub?
- My stub?

238
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,081
Who keeps the stub?

239
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,493
No one holds on to the stub.

240
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,537
I'm going to the movies for 25 years,
nobody ever asked me for the stub.

241
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:30,586
You don't remember me?

242
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,511
- It's a big city, sir.
- I went in with a pretty woman.

243
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,431
You know, short, big wall of hair,
face like a frying pan.

244
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,054
Nope.

245
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:43,563
- I can't find it.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

246
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:49,396
All right. Here. It's my friend's ticket.

247
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,539
Elaine?

248
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:08,002
- Elaine?
- Sit down!

249
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:11,666
- Elaine?
- Hey, shut up!

250
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:14,131
- I'm looking for my friend.
- Check the bathroom.

251
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,675
- You're bothering us.
- I know my friend's here.

252
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,172
- What do you want me to do?
- You can shut up!

253
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,853
- Elaine?
- Shut up!

254
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:33,946
Elaine?

255
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,113
Elaine?

256
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,986
<i>The Village Voice calls it
a masterpiece.</i>

257
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:44,456
<i>A young woman's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.</i>

258
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:50,379
<i>It's a story about life and love
and becoming a woman.</i>

259
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,754
Rochelle Rochelle.

260
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:56,045
<i>Now playing at the Paradise Two.</i>

261
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:25,951
Thank you.

262
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,709
Can I have a medium Diet Coke?

263
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,747
- You want the medium or middle size?
- What's the difference?

264
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:33,210
We have three sizes:
medium, large and jumbo.

265
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:34,710
What happened to the small?

266
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,543
There is no small. Small's medium.

267
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:40,378
- So, what's medium?
- Medium's large, and large is jumbo.

268
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:43,262
- Okay, give me the large.
- That's medium.

269
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,092
Right. Yeah.
Can I have a small popcorn?

270
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,595
There is no small.
Child-size is small.

271
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,014
- What's medium?
- Adult.

272
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:55,486
- Do adults ever order the child-size?
- Not usually.

273
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,938
- Okay, give me the adult.
- Do you want butter?

274
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,191
- Is it real butter?
- It's butter flavouring.

275
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,027
Yeah, well, what is it made of?

276
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,780
It's yellow.

277
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,749
Thanks. Thank you. You don't know
how long I've been waiting out there.

278
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:18,209
Very busy tonight. Very busy.
Where you go?

279
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,294
Forty-Fourth and 9th.

280
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,306
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.

281
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,474
Ticket, sir?

282
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,134
We've just been through this.

283
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:31,977
You don't remember? We just had
this exact conversation a minute ago.

284
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,477
I need to see your stub.

285
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:38,904
I got the stub. I got the stub.

286
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,990
I put it right in my pocket.
I got the...

287
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,485
I'm telling you, I got the stub.
I just...

288
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,280
- I don't know where it is.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

289
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:52,157
You just let me in.
We just did this a minute ago!

290
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,339
All right. Okay. There.
There you go, okay?

291
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,382
That's my other friend's ticket. Happy?

292
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:03,637
You got two tickets.
Two of my friends.

293
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:09,680
Ticket, sir?

294
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:13,269
No, see, my friend bought me a ticket.
I'm late. She's already inside.

295
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,148
- Go ahead. Enjoy the movie.
- Thanks.

296
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,192
<i>- What is it, Your Majesty?
- Anyone asks-</i>

297
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,325
- Is that seat taken?
- It's all yours.

298
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,902
<i>When I tell you something,
you damn better listen.</i>

299
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:32,117
<i>- I'm getting tired of these questions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

300
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:36,207
<i>I'm sorry, Grendel, I...
I've been very taxed lately.</i>

301
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,919
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
You give me a few minutes.

302
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,048
I have to stop for gasoline.

303
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,341
Gas? Can't you get it
after you drop me off?

304
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:48,138
No. Impossible.
It is on empty. See.

305
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,060
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

306
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,389
What happened to my seat?

307
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,475
Oh, my God, where was I?

308
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,486
- Hey, sit down. I can't see.
- Get out of the way.

309
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:01,982
I can't find my seat.

310
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,907
- Just move!
- No, you move!

311
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:07,233
Get the hell out of here!

312
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,912
<i>Come, come, you're soaking wet.
Come in.</i>

313
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,076
<i>My name is Rochelle.
I'm from Milan.</i>

314
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,245
<i>I'm supposed to visit
relatives in Minsk.</i>

315
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,749
<i>Yes. Come by the fire.</i>

316
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,081
<i>Take off those wet clothes.
You'll catch cold.</i>

317
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:25,042
<i>My hands are so cold,
I can barely get these buttons open.</i>

318
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:29,216
<i>That's much better.
Much, much better.</i>

319
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:39,391
Listen, I just went
to go get popcorn and-

320
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,019
God. I just went to go
get popcorn, okay...

321
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:46,032
...and somebody took my seat,
and my coat is in there.

322
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,777
There's a seat in the front row.

323
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,860
No, no, I can't sit in the front row.

324
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:51,531
You're gonna have to wait then.

325
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,077
I can't stand around here
for two hours.

326
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,621
<i>I can let you see
Rochelle Rochelle.</i>

327
00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:59,586
Thanks.

328
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,668
Hey, listen, by the way...

329
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:05,795
...have you seen
a tall, lanky doofus...

330
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:09,919
...with a bird face and hair like
the Bride of Frankenstein?

331
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,217
Haven't seen him.

332
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,138
Okay.

333
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:18,638
- Let's go. I'm gonna miss my spot.
- Yes, yes.

334
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:21,977
We go. We go. One minute.
I run across the street for cigarettes.

335
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:24,145
I don't have time.
I'm gonna miss my spot.

336
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:27,606
No, no. We go very soon.

337
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:31,234
<i>I didn't know you enjoyed chess,
Your Majesty.</i>

338
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,822
<i>Why wouldn't I?</i>

339
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,452
<i>Well, because the king
is always in jeopardy.</i>

340
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,498
<i>Yes, but it's only a game.</i>

341
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:41,333
<i>Yes, of course. Only a game.</i>

342
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,672
- Hey, did I make it?
- Sorry.

343
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:53,346
Great. That's great. What a night.

344
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:57,930
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen.
Another round of applause for Pat.

345
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,515
Good set.

346
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,018
You got my spot?

347
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,441
- That athlete's-foot bit killed.
- Really?

348
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,696
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- Weight? No.

349
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,822
You just need some height.

350
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:13,824
- Don't start. What are you doing now?
- What am I doing?

351
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:17,162
My night's ruined. I didn't do any sets,
didn't go to the movies.

352
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,870
<i>Come on. We can still catch
most of Rochelle Rochelle.</i>

353
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,372
<i>Rochelle Rochelle?</i>

354
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:26,041
A young girl's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

355
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:27,883
Minsk?

356
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,714
<i>My father was a shoemaker.</i>

357
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>He worked hard,
we didn't have much money.</i>

358
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,298
<i>Rochelle, what are we
going to do with you?</i>

359
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,682
<i>- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Where are you going?</i>

360
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:41,269
<i>- I want to go. Take me with you.
- Well, don't be a silly goose.</i>

361
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
<i>I've never seen Minsk. I hear
there's so much hustle and bustle.</i>

362
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:47,190
<i>You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.</i>

363
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:51,070
<i>- Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know-?
- Give me a break!</i>

364
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:55,576
Elaine?

365
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,572
- Jerry.
- Elaine.

366
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,907
- Shut up.
- Jerry?

367
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,159
- George?
- Elaine?

368
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,583
George.

369
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,962
- But where's Kramer?
- Will you shut up?

370
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,754
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?

371
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,383
Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

372
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,883
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

373
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:18,426
Jerry, take the coat.
Please. One month.

374
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:20,808
I don't want the coat.

375
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,437
Jerry, call me when you get home,
so I know you're okay.

376
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,444
- What happened to you?
- I missed you at the other theatre.

377
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:30,770
Then I missed my set,
and I had nothing to do.

378
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,821
Man. Look at this.

379
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,945
<i>- I sat in gum.
- What happened to Checkmate?</i>

380
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,619
Oh, I went out to get popcorn,
and some creep took my seat.

381
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,616
Hey, by the way,
you owe me $7.50.

382
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:45,208
- But I didn't even use the ticket.
- I still paid for it.

383
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,918
- I only have a 20.
- Hi.

384
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,750
- Hey!
- What happened to you?

385
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:53,341
That's my coat. Give me that.
Where did you get that?

386
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:54,970
It was on the seat.

387
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,514
You took my seat?

388
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,517
- You owe me $7.50.
- Yeah. Right.

389
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,806
What is this stain?

390
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:06,598
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?

391
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,475
But I always get confused
in the movie theatre by the plot.

392
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:14,319
It's embarrassing to have to admit,
but I'm the one you see...

393
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,990
...in the parking lot, after the movie,
talking with his friends, going:

394
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,910
"You mean, that was the same guy
from the beginning?"

395
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:28,414
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theatre, you can't find out.

396
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,795
Why did they kill that guy?

397
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,465
Why did they kill him?

398
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,512
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?

399
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:41,014
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?

400
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,936
Why would they kill him
if he was with them?

401
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,811
Oh, he wasn't really with them.

402
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,106
I thought he was with them.

403
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:53,561
It's a good thing they killed him.
