1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:04,385
When you ask for the doggy bag
in a restaurant...

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:07,302
...there's a sense of failure.

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,224
People always whisper it
to the waiter, " Excuse me...

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:15,180
...I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to give me the doggy bag.

5
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,232
I couldn't make it."

6
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,143
It is embarrassing because
a doggy bag means either...

7
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,777
...you were at a restaurant
when you're not hungry...

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,860
...or you've chosen the stupidest
way to get dog food that there is.

9
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:30,410
How about the doggy bag
on a date?

10
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:32,076
That's a good move for a guy.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,619
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you
ask for the doggy bag on a date...

12
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:39,081
...you might as well have them
just wrap up your genitals too.

13
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:42,258
You're not gonna be needing
those for a while either.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,435
- Is that bothering you?
- No. Not at all.

15
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,306
It's the BMW.

16
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:01,525
Oh, could you please hurry?

17
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,988
"Please hurry."

18
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:06,363
Look at you.
Look what you've become.

19
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,204
What? What have I become?
I haven't become anything.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,078
Oh, Carl can't wait a few...

21
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,738
- ...more minutes?
- I don't want to keep him waiting.

22
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,120
- He'll like you more.
- That's impossible.

23
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,917
Stan, why do you have to
pick your teeth at the table?

24
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:22,794
- Leave me alone.
- It's disgusting.

25
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:26,134
Yeah, I'm gonna get married
real soon.

26
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:29,221
- So where am I dropping you?
- His place.

27
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,966
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner...

28
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,637
...then drop you at his apartment.

29
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,385
And he gets the rest of my chicken.

30
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,559
So is tonight the night?

31
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,109
You never know.

32
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:43,317
Baby doll.

33
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,822
Thank you, brother.

34
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,883
What, do you smell something?

35
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,968
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

36
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:10,510
- Of course I smell something.
- What is it?

37
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,009
I think its BO.

38
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,979
What?

39
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:21,184
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.

40
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,855
It can't be. Nobody has BO like this.

41
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:28,363
Jerry, its BO.

42
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,656
But the whole car smells.

43
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:33,365
- So?
- So when somebody has BO...

44
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:35,863
...the O usually stays with the B.

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,997
Once the B leaves,
the O goes with it.

46
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:48,792
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,218
- I can't believe you ski.
- I'm a great skier.

48
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,673
Yeah, what else?

49
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,807
Let's see. I ski, I fish...

50
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,641
...I pillage, I plunder.

51
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,146
- You pillage and plunder?
- When I travel.

52
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:09,654
See, finally, finally I get
to meet a man...

53
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:13,573
...who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,507
- It should only take a second.
- Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.

55
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,306
<i>Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.</i>

56
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,884
<i>A lesbian sighting.</i>

57
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,605
<i>My lucky day.</i>

58
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:45,106
<i>They're so fascinating. Why is that?</i>

59
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,399
<i>Because they don't want us.</i>

60
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,069
<i>You gotta respect that.</i>

61
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,276
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,617
<i>It's Susan! But what do I do?</i>

63
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,703
George?

64
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,659
- Susan. Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,999
Oh, boy.

66
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,040
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,420
- Renting a video.
- Right.

68
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,836
What do you got there?

69
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,631
Oh, some- some stupid movie.

70
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:15,129
This is Mona.

71
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,474
Hi.

72
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:21,394
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes. Well...

73
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,314
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

74
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,561
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yes.

75
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,897
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.

76
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,944
And you didn't expect me to be
holding hands with a woman.

77
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:38,948
Oh, please. Me?

78
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,328
Come on, that's great.

79
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,955
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.

80
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,119
I've always encouraged
experimentation.

81
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:50,340
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?

82
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:53,177
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Of course you do.

83
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:58,265
It's just, you know,
I never knew that...

84
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,639
- I like women?
- There you go.

85
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:05,019
So how long has this
been going on?

86
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,850
Since you and I broke up.

87
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:15,157
So after me, you...

88
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,949
...went that way?

89
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,702
Yeah.

90
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,204
I think that's fantastic. Good for you.

91
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,699
Nice. That's very nice.

92
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:32,959
- So, what do you got there?
- I don't-

93
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:37,171
<i>- Rochelle, Rochelle.
- Yeah.</i>

94
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:41,130
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.

95
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,764
- A lot of nudity in that, huh?
- No, no, just a tiny bit.

96
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,431
It's not even frontal nudity.

97
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:48,356
It's "sidal" nudity.

98
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,357
Next.

99
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,229
- That's me.
- Good seeing you, George.

100
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,897
Yes, good to see you too.

101
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,649
And good luck with...

102
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,816
With the whole thing there.

103
00:06:00,244 --> 00:06:01,573
What are you returning?

104
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:05,201
<i>Rochelle, Rochelle.</i>

105
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:07,497
<i>Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange...</i>

106
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,206
- ...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:13,126
That'll be $3.49.

108
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,007
Three forty-nine? It says $1.49.

109
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,928
You didn't rewind it. There's
a $2 charge for not rewinding.

110
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,839
But there's no signs here.

111
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,885
- This is an outrage.
- Don't give him any money for that.

112
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,929
It'll cost you less to keep it
another day, rewind it...

113
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:29,769
...and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

114
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,897
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.

115
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,777
I'm gonna watch it again.

116
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,820
How could that hurt?

117
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,699
So this morning I go down
to the garage to check the car out.

118
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,823
I figure by this time,
the odour molecules have had...

119
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:48,117
- ...at least 12 hours to "de-smellify."
- Right.

120
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,499
I open the car door...

121
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,161
...like a punch in the face...

122
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,215
...the stench hits me.

123
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:58,586
It's almost as if it had gained strength
throughout the night.

124
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,928
You know, I can think of at least
six known offensive odours...

125
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,134
...that I would rather smell
than what's living in your car.

126
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,385
- What about skunk?
- I don't mind skunk.

127
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,135
- Horse manure?
- I love horse manure.

128
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,398
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

129
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,146
In fact, I went to the car wash...

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,985
...they want $250 to detail it
and get the smell out.

131
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,238
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.

132
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:26,281
I'm driving to that restaurant,
and demand they pay for it.

133
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,163
Absolutely.

134
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,918
Listen, let me ask you something.

135
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,333
When you're with a guy and he
tells you he has to get up early...

136
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:39,294
- ...what does that mean?
- It means he's lying.

137
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:46,506
- Why, is that what he told you?
- Yeah. Last night.

138
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:49,638
Oh, come on. Men have to
get up early sometime.

139
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,852
No. Never.

140
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:56,020
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on
the street early in the morning.

141
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:58,352
Well, sometimes we do
have to get up early...

142
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,522
...but a man will always
trade sleep for sex.

143
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:03,615
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

144
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,530
Anything's possible.

145
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,708
Yeah.

146
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,253
- What's the matter with you?
- Steinbrenner!

147
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,330
- He's ruining my life.
- Oh, yes.

148
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,211
- Steinbrenner.
- I can't take another season with him.

149
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,460
He just traded away
their best prospects...

150
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,136
...just like he did with Buhner,
McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.

151
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,849
I know the list.

152
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,641
What's that smell?

153
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,519
What-? What smell?

154
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,982
You stink.

155
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,312
- What do you mean, I stink?
- You stink.

156
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,814
- Why don't you take a shower.
- I showered.

157
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,825
Oh, wait a second.

158
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,663
Since I showered, I've been in the car.

159
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,451
- So?
- Don't you see what's happening?

160
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:54,245
It's attached itself to me. It's alive.

161
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:57,953
If it's attached itself to you...

162
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,915
Oh, my God.

163
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:04,219
That's why Carl said he had to
get up early, because I stink.

164
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:07,223
Jerry, he thinks I have BO. Me.

165
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,176
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,845
<i>- It's George.
- I'm coming down.</i>

167
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,305
- All right, what happened?
- What happened?

168
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,722
My car stinks is what happened.

169
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,233
And it's destroying the lives
of everyone in its path.

170
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,861
- This is BO?
- Yes.

171
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,027
- This is unbelievable BO.
- I know.

172
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,990
At the car wash, the guy told me
in 38 years in the business...

173
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,786
...he's never smelled anything like it.

174
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,960
So let me ask you, do you think
I could've done this?

175
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,252
No, no. It's the valet guy.

176
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:43,459
No, no. I mean, driven Susan
to lesbianism.

177
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,757
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

178
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,501
What if her experience with me
drove her to it.

179
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,887
Suicide, maybe. Not lesbianism.

180
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,802
The woman she was
"lesbianing" with...

181
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,894
...Susan told me she's never
been with a guy.

182
00:09:56,856 --> 00:10:00,984
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO. It's BBO.

183
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,987
There should be a BO squad
that patrols the city...

184
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:07,488
...to sniff them out, strip them down
and wash them with a soapy brush.

185
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:13,032
The funny thing is, somehow
I find her more appealing now.

186
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,703
Like, if I knew she was
a lesbian when we went out...

187
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,163
...I never would've
broken up with her.

188
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,830
Let me see if I understand this.

189
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:23,672
On second thought...

190
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,675
Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.

191
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,258
No, thank you. Go back.

192
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,712
No, go back.

193
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,683
No, back, back.

194
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:37,853
Go back. I got it. I'll park it.

195
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,773
I'll park it. Go back. You go back.

196
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:44,026
Sorry. Thank you.
Thank you, no.

197
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:47,279
What do you mean "stunk up"?

198
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,072
I mean the car stinks.

199
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,522
George, does the car stink?

200
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,195
- Stinks.
- Stinks.

201
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,611
Well, perhaps you're the one
who has the odour.

202
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,828
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.

203
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:00,119
- Really? Well, I can smell you now.
- That's from the car.

204
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,129
Maybe you stunk up the car,
rather than the car stinking up you.

205
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,870
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.

206
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,340
Thank you very much.

207
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,298
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.

208
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,879
I don't have time to smell cars.

209
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:15,801
Forget about smelling the car.

210
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,969
Smell the valet. Go to the source.

211
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,897
- You gotta smell the car.
- I'm a busy man.

212
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,393
Come on. One whiff.

213
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,728
All right. One whiff.

214
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,318
All right. I give up. I admit it, it stinks.

215
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,740
Now could you let me out?

216
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:39,116
- Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
- Yes, $50. I'll give you $50.

217
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,495
- Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
- Whatever you want.

218
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,457
- I'll give you whatever you want!
- I want half, 125.

219
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,834
Yes! Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!

220
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,168
- All right.
- Let me out of here!

221
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,423
- Oh, my God.
- What?

222
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,684
The video. Someone stole
the video right out of the car.

223
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,889
<i>- Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
- Well, you left the window open.</i>

224
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,392
We had to air out the car.

225
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:06,317
- You should pay for it.
- I'm not paying for that.

226
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,478
They already got my $7.

227
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:12,438
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

228
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:20,781
- The valet had such bad BO?
- Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.

229
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,205
The O went from the valet's B
to the car to me.

230
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,792
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.

231
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:35,053
But I showered,
and I shampooed. So...

232
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,093
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,561
- What?
- It's still there.

234
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,303
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed. I rinsed.

235
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:47,475
- I repeated.
- It's still there. I smelled it.

236
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,560
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.

237
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,982
- No. No.
- No, here, just-

238
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,815
Please!

239
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,653
Which movie was that again?

240
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,368
<i>Rochelle, Rochelle.</i>

241
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,078
George.

242
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,657
Hey. Thanks for meeting me here.

243
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:04,449
- Yeah, I don't have much time.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you...

244
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,833
...I was a little concerned that...

245
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:11,333
...perhaps I was responsible
in some way for your...

246
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:14,000
...metamorphosis.

247
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,088
That'll be $98.

248
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,843
What $98?

249
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,428
That's what I said, $98.

250
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,806
How could that piece
of crap cost $98?

251
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,973
- George, I really have-
- Do you believe this?

252
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,355
Ninety-eight dollars!

253
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:32,857
Do you have any cash?

254
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,857
I guess.

255
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:38,033
I need, like, 35. Thanks.

256
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,694
So was it me?

257
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:44,785
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Is that what
you wanted to talk to me about?

258
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,334
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

259
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:49,705
- Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,371
- I gotta go.
- Listen.

261
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,341
Let me ask you something:

262
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:58,588
If you and Mona were ever
to dance...

263
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,676
...how do you decide who leads?

264
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,301
I mean, do you take turns?

265
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,313
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?

266
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,054
You're an idiot.

267
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:14,188
Why? That's a legitimate
sociological question.

268
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:15,561
- I'll see you.
- But-

269
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:18,277
Oh, and George, by the way...

270
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,736
...you stink. You need a bath.

271
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,035
It's not me! It's the car!

272
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,038
I didn't think I'd come.

273
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:32,838
I knew you would.

274
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,301
- Oh, Mona.
- Oh, Kramer.

275
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,427
You can give it the executive
treatment. That includes...

276
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,305
...complete deionization
of the entire vehicle.

277
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:50,690
Where we spray everything
with Ozium-D, let it deionise...

278
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:54,108
...vacuum the spray out
with a deionising machine.

279
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:56,354
Hit it with high-pressure
compressed air...

280
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,365
...and wet-dry vac it to extract
the remaining liquids.

281
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:02,613
And we top it off with
one of our seven air fresheners.

282
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:07,532
In your case, I would recommend
the jasmine or the potpourri.

283
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,417
Let's do it.

284
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,837
The first thing that we're gonna do...

285
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:18,210
...is flush the follicles
with the five essential oils.

286
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,385
Then we put you under a vapour
machine, and then a heated cap.

287
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,964
Then we shampoo and shampoo...

288
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:26,636
...and condition and condition.

289
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,976
Then we saturate the hair...

290
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,641
...in diluted vinegar.

291
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:36,608
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work...

292
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,151
...we have one last resort.

293
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,782
Tomato sauce.

294
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,699
Tomato sauce?

295
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:02,802
Thanks a lot.

296
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:14,981
Wait a minute.

297
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,268
It still smells.

298
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,353
It still smells!

299
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,364
It still smells.

300
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,697
It still smells.

301
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:31,489
- How could it still smell after all that?
- I don't know.

302
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,703
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.

303
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,037
- You're selling the car?
- You don't understand...

304
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,670
...what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful...

305
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,502
...than anything you can imagine.

306
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:45,218
Even Superman would be helpless
against this kind of stench.

307
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:48,174
And I'll take anything I can get for it.

308
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,678
Maybe I'll buy it.

309
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:52,675
Are you crazy?

310
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,764
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?

311
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,475
This isn't just an odour. You need
a priest to get rid of this thing.

312
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,398
- I still smell.
- You see?

313
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:06,487
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence. It's the beast.

314
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,405
All right, let me smell you.

315
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,406
Kramer. Kramer!

316
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:14,748
- What's that? What's going on?
- Kramer open up, I know you're there!

317
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,578
- Susan.
- Kramer!

318
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:19,375
- What is going on?
- You know what's going on?

319
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,754
First, he vomits on me.

320
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,712
Then he burns down
my father's cabin.

321
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,212
And now he's taken
Mona away from me.

322
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:30,094
- He stole your girlfriend?
- Yes.

323
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,102
She's in love with him.

324
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:36,600
Amazing.

325
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,264
I drive them to lesbianism,
he brings them back.

326
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,573
Hello.

327
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,118
<i>- She still there?
- No. She left.</i>

328
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,074
- What is going on? What did you do?
- I don't know, I didn't do anything.

329
00:17:57,252 --> 00:18:01,582
I was in the video store, and I was
practicing my golf swing, you know.

330
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,749
You know, with a broom, and-

331
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:07,970
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing,
and she told me...

332
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:12,800
...that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.

333
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:16,262
She's a golf teacher. So I went
to a lesson, and, you know...

334
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,976
...something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.

335
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,099
I've struck gold! I've already taken
six strokes off my game.

336
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:27,817
That's the least of what
you've accomplished.

337
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:31,362
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?

338
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,823
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

339
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,950
Wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.

340
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:40,585
This woman has never been
with a man her entire life.

341
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,170
I'm Kramer.

342
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:50,128
Look, I know what you're
going through.

343
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:52,843
Women. Who knows what they want?

344
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,475
I just don't know what
she sees in Kramer.

345
00:18:56,645 --> 00:19:01,022
Listen, you're beautiful. You're
intelligent. You'll meet other girls.

346
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,434
- You think so?
- Yes, I know so.

347
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,687
You happen to be
a very eligible lesbian.

348
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:11,942
- You're very sweet.
- Hey, I know what I'm talking about.

349
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,989
But I gotta be honest with you,
I gotta tell you...

350
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:18,622
...ever since I saw you holding hands
with that woman...

351
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,702
...I can't get you out of my mind.

352
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:22,712
- Really?
- Yeah.

353
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,453
You're just so hip.

354
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,217
- Oh, my God.
- What?

355
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:32,548
It's Allison. I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.

356
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,719
George?

357
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,977
Allison. Hi.

358
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,817
- Oh, my God. How are you?
- Good.

359
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,522
You know, you owe me $50.

360
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:49,233
Fifty dollars, right. Right.

361
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:52,857
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

362
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,908
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,696
That's a beautiful vest.

364
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,579
Thank you.

365
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,591
I don't understand it. I was with her
last night at my apartment.

366
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,219
It was very romantic.

367
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:16,052
With that fake wood wallpaper, the
atmosphere is fabulous in there now.

368
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:17,553
It's like a ski lodge.

369
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,635
- What year did you say this was?
- Ninety.

370
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:23,145
We're on the couch. I moved to hug
her, next she tells me she's leaving...

371
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,106
...she's got to get up early.

372
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,944
- That's strange.
- How many miles you got on this?

373
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,356
Twenty-three thousand.

374
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,072
And I was looking good too.

375
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,612
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.

376
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:36,692
Wait a second. My jacket.

377
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,443
I wore that in the car. The beast.

378
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,449
- This wicked funk.
- What?

379
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:45,959
I can't sell this car.

380
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:51,293
This thing.

381
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,461
It's got to be stopped.

382
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,591
- So, what do you want to do?
- Sauce me.

383
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,683
Why do we need BO?

384
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,562
What is the function of it?

385
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,850
Everything in nature has a reason,
has a purpose, except BO.

386
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:51,695
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good...

387
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:55,028
...hard work, exercise,
you smell very bad.

388
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:58,734
This is the way the human being
is designed. You move, you stink.

389
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,119
Why can't our bodies help us?

390
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,666
Why can't sweat smell good?
It'd be a different world, wouldn't it?

391
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:09,871
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper, put it in a vase.

392
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:13,546
Go down to the drug store, pick up
some odorant and perspirant.

393
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:16,920
Probably have a dirty sock hanging
from the rearview mirror of your car.

394
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,467
Then on a special night,
maybe a little underwear...

395
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,347
...coming out of your breast pocket.

396
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:24,007
Just to show her that she's important.
