1
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:05,799
You can't have adultery.
You commit it.

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:09,556
You can't even commit adultery unless
you already have a commitment.

3
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:13,227
So you have to make the commitment
before thinking about committing it.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,433
There's no commit without the commit.

5
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:19,024
Then, once you commit,
then you can commit the adultery.

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,567
Then you get caught, get divorced,
lose your mind...

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,234
...and they have you committed.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:28,366
You know, some people actually cheat
on the people they're cheating with...

9
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,910
...which is like, you know,
being in a holdup...

10
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:33,371
...and turning to the robber
next to you and going:

11
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:35,536
"All right, give me everything
you have too."

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,008
You met her
at the supermarket? How?

13
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:45,751
Produce section.
Very provocative area.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,884
Lots of melons and shapes.
Everyone squeezing and smelling.

15
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,469
It just happened.

16
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:52,636
- So when you gonna see her?
- Tonight.

17
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:56,263
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

18
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:59,395
- How could you not know her name?
- I was nervous. I got distracted.

19
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,142
It had something to do
with a car or a fish.

20
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:07,573
Look at... Why do I get bananas?
They're good for one day.

21
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,370
Oh, my God. I forgot to tell you.

22
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,112
I got a letter today from
the State Controller's Office.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,869
Back in public school in Brooklyn...

24
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:17,581
...every week I put 50 cents
in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

25
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:20,245
- Yeah, I did that too.
- Remember the little bankbook?

26
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:24,041
I haven't put anything in it since sixth
grade. I completely forgot about it.

27
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,176
The State Controller's Office
tracks me down.

28
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,629
The interest has accumulated
to $1900.

29
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,132
Nineteen hundred dollars.
They're sending me a check.

30
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:33,843
Yeah. Interest. It's an amazing thing.

31
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,221
You make money
without doing anything.

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,644
I have friends that base their whole life
on that principle.

33
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,819
- Really? Who?
- Nobody you know.

34
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:47,271
Maybe I'll go down to the track,
put it all on a horse.

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,110
Why don't you put it in the bank.

36
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:52,028
Bank? This is found money.

37
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,447
I want to parlay it.
I wanna make a big score.

38
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,950
You mean you wanna lose it.

39
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:01,543
Yeah. All right.

40
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:05,211
- You got it, huh?
- Yes, I did.

41
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:07,294
- Yes.
- What's with the gloves?

42
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,839
Well, I'm staining my floors. You know,
I don't wanna get my hands dirty.

43
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,304
- What, the whole apartment?
- The whole apartment.

44
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:15,599
And I'm buying
that fake-wood wallpaper.

45
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,186
I'm gonna surround myself
in wood.

46
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:21,729
It's gonna be like a log cabin.

47
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,810
Because I need wood around me.

48
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,987
Wood, Jerry. Wood.

49
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,901
- Wood is good.
- Definitely.

50
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:32,234
So we're still going to play
racquetball, right?

51
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:35,247
- Yeah. Whenever you're ready.
- Okay. Soon as Elaine gets here.

52
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,532
<i>- What, you rented Home Alone?
- Yeah.</i>

53
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,207
<i>- I thought you saw that.
- No, I saw Home Alone 2.</i>

54
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,166
Oh, right. But you hated it.

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,460
Well, I was lost.
I never saw the first one.

56
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,835
- By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
- What for?

57
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:53,931
If I watch it at my apartment,
I feel like I'm not doing anything.

58
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,591
Here, I'm out of the house,
I'm doing something.

59
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,350
All right, go ahead.

60
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:02,813
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me. Are you ready to go?</i>

61
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:05,142
No. Come on up.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,944
I can't work with these.

63
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:11,153
- What's wrong?
- You bought me dishwashing gloves.

64
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,781
- There's no fine touch.
- You said "gloves."

65
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:16,361
No. No, these are too thick.

66
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,867
<i>- Is that Home Alone?
- Yeah. The original.</i>

67
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,874
- Hey, boys-o.
- Hey!

68
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,963
Hello.

69
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,543
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

70
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,626
Wait a minute.
There's a change of plans.

71
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:32,922
- What?
- Remember Roy, the artist?

72
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,968
- Oh, the triangle guy.
- Yeah. Exactly. The triangle guy.

73
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:39,593
- Yeah. You liked him. What happened?
- Yeah, I did. He was very talented.

74
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,471
He was just, I don't know,
a little too...

75
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:46,354
- Artsy?
- Fat.

76
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,437
He was a fat starving artist,
you know?

77
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,190
- That's very rare.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,856
Anyway, he's in the hospital,
he's having surgery...

79
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,073
- ...and I should go visit him.
- What's wrong?

80
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,818
Something with his spleen.
It'll just take five minutes.

81
00:03:57,997 --> 00:03:59,657
Okay? The hospital's
right on the way.

82
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:03,166
- All right. We'll wait for you.
- I can get some rubber gloves there.

83
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,122
Listen, Jerry, could you
do me a favour?

84
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,836
Could you go into the room
with me to visit him?

85
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,425
Because I don't want him to think
that I'm, you know, interested.

86
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,589
You want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend.

87
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:18,262
- Well...
- Well, I think I can do that.

88
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,925
I've played that role before
to some critical acclaim.

89
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,313
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

90
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:24,644
- Yep.
- What's with him?

91
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,057
You know, a lot of people
have asked that.

92
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,817
Roy.

93
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,446
Elaine.

94
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,112
What a surprise.

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,532
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:46,663
I hardly recognize you. You look so-

97
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,829
- Yeah, I've lost some weight.
- A lot of weight.

98
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,966
- I know.
- You look terrific.

99
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,216
Thank you. So do you.

100
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:06,182
This is... You really lost weight.

101
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:09,940
- Thank you.
- Jerry. I'm the boyfriend.

102
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,783
<i>Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.</i>

103
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,906
<i>Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.</i>

104
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,747
The mother lode.

105
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,717
I can't believe it. You were huge.

106
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,968
Like blubber.

107
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,971
I couldn't even get my arms
around you.

108
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,471
Yes. I remember.

109
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,182
That's a positive thing
about getting sick.

110
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:54,404
- You get to lose weight.
- Elaine, it wasn't the illness.

111
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,648
- It was you.
- Me?

112
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,904
Yeah. After you stopped seeing me,
I was devastated.

113
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,656
I couldn't eat for weeks.

114
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,115
Get out!

115
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,670
- Really. It's the truth.
- Jerry, did you hear this?

116
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,081
He couldn't eat for weeks.

117
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,417
That's terrible.

118
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,471
I had no idea I had
that kind of effect on you.

119
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,633
You did.

120
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,938
You know, I can't get
this damn thing to sleep.

121
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,767
Now, listen, Roy, tell me something:

122
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,026
- When are you getting out of here?
- Next Thursday.

123
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,686
Okay, I tell you what.
How about on Friday...

124
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,941
...I take you out for a big meal,
because you are getting too thin.

125
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,195
Honey...

126
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:51,538
...aren't we going to
the Poconos next Friday?

127
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,464
No, that's the week after.

128
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,838
No, I believe it's next week.

129
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,298
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

130
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,097
Shut up.

131
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,718
Pay dirt.

132
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,268
Roy, this is Kramer.
He's one of our friends.

133
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,015
- How do you do?
- I do great.

134
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,652
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Dr. Siegel.

135
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:21,654
Hey, doc, check this out.

136
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:24,115
- Hey.
- I just learned that.

137
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,702
I just wanted to stop by...

138
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:31,626
...see if you had any questions
about tomorrow's operation.

139
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:34,581
Yeah, yeah, I have-
I have a question.

140
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,709
What do you know about
interabdominal retractors?

141
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:41,087
<i>Are you asking because
you saw 20/20 last night?</i>

142
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:43,219
I sure am.

143
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,339
Well, that report was about
one very specific type of retractor.

144
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:49,641
And I can assure you we do not use...

145
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,350
...that retractor
in your friend's procedure.

146
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,690
But you will use a retractor.

147
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,188
We have to.

148
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,117
I'll tell you what. You're obviously
concerned about your friend's welfare.

149
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,077
A few of my students will be
observing tomorrow's operation...

150
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,501
...from the viewing gallery. How would
you like to watch it with them?

151
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:17,960
- I'd love to watch the operation.
- I don't know.

152
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,796
Come on, Jerry,
you gotta see the operation.

153
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,218
They're gonna cut him open.
His guts will be all over the place.

154
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,095
- Yeah, that's true.
- They'll saw through bone.

155
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,178
We'll see what's inside bone.

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,783
- Hey.
- Hi.

157
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,570
- What are you doing? You're crying?
- No.

158
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,742
<i>You're crying from Home Alone?</i>

159
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:58,462
- The old man got to me.
- All right.

160
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,204
Get yourself together.
I don't know if I can be friends...

161
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:04,550
- ...with you anymore after this display.
- Oh, shut up.

162
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,589
What are you doing back
so soon, anyway?

163
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,258
I never even got to the gym.
Kramer got the gloves...

164
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,106
...wanted to come home
and start working on his floor.

165
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:17,265
- How's the guy?
- He's okay.

166
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,600
Him and Elaine
are getting pretty chummy.

167
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,401
Elaine wants me to buy his art.

168
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,567
- That's nerve.
- Yeah. So she and triangle boy...

169
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,780
...can go out to fancy restaurants.

170
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,364
You know what it is?

171
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,410
It's Clara Nightingale Syndrome.

172
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,617
- He falls ill, she falls in love.
- You mean Florence Nightingale.

173
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,042
- What did I say, " Clara"?
- You must have meant Clara Barton.

174
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:42,126
Clara Barton? What did she do?

175
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:46,418
I'm not sure,
but I think she was nice.

176
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,969
Susan B. Anthony I think
I'd have a problem with.

177
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:53,144
Yeah, I think you would.

178
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,721
So are you gonna buy his art?

179
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,971
No. Why don't you buy it.
You got $1900.

180
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,603
Yeah. That's what I want. Triangles.

181
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,898
I'm out of here.
Have fun with whatshername.

182
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,611
I will.

183
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,650
You know, now you gotta ask her
her name. It's so embarrassing.

184
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:09,611
- No, it isn't. I can find out.
- Yeah? How?

185
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,828
There are ways.

186
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,327
You know, I remember
when I was a kid growing up...

187
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,251
...kids would make fun of my name
like you wouldn't believe.

188
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,336
"Jerry, Jerry, Dingleberry" and...

189
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,079
- ..."Seinsmelled."
- Seinsmelled?

190
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,836
Yeah.

191
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,335
What about you? Did people
make fun of your name?

192
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,837
Are you kidding?
They were merciless.

193
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,924
What do you expect
when your name rhymes...

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,892
...with a part of the female anatomy?

195
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,944
Of course, not everybody can be
as sweet as you are.

196
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:54,244
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, you.

197
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,371
Now, let's try " breast."

198
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,124
Celeste.

199
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,707
- Kest.
- No.

200
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:12,713
- Rest. Sest. Hest.
- Hest?

201
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,432
That's not a name.

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,305
- You should have just asked her.
- I know I should have asked.

203
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,265
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know. I can't ask her now.

204
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,479
I've already made out with her.

205
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,938
Once you make out,
you can't ask her her name.

206
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,361
Aretha.

207
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,449
No.

208
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:35,784
- Bovary.
- All right, that's enough.

209
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,034
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go through her purse.

210
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
The credit cards, driver's license.

211
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,417
- Well, how am I gonna do that?
- When she goes to the bathroom.

212
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,578
- There you are.
- Hey.

213
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,251
My date stood me up.

214
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,261
Listen, will you guys go
to the operation with me?

215
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,266
You asked a date
to go to the operation?

216
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,713
Yeah.

217
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:58,221
So come on. What do you say?

218
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,095
- What kind of operation is it?
- Splenectomy.

219
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,561
- Isn't that where they remove the-?
- Don't ruin it.

220
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,643
I haven't seen it yet.

221
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,481
- Now, come on. What do you say?
- Mulva.

222
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,945
Mulva?

223
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,111
Come on, come on. You wanna go?

224
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,948
- Come on. Yeah.
- All right. All right.

225
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,950
Just let me finish my coffee.

226
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,576
Then we'll watch them go
slice this fat bastard up.

227
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,751
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

228
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:33,631
...exposing the body's
internal organs.

229
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,806
Nurse, retractor.

230
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,814
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.

231
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,860
- You want one?
- No.

232
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,022
Now, I can't see.

233
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,737
Could you get-?

234
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,502
Where'd you get those?

235
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,170
- The machine. You want one?
- No.

236
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,088
- Here. Take one.
- I don't want one.

237
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,888
- No, they're good.
- I don't want any.

238
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:21,141
- Just take one.
- No. Stop- Kramer, stop it.

239
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:38,656
<i>- Did it go in?
- Yes.</i>

240
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,746
Over the balcony, bounced off
some respirator thing...

241
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,710
...into the patient.

242
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,832
What do you mean,
"Into the patient"?

243
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,167
Into the patient. Literally.

244
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,179
- Into the hole?
- Yes.

245
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:00,055
The hole.

246
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,015
- Didn't they notice it?
- No.

247
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:05,849
- How could they not notice it?
- Because it's a little mint.

248
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:08,144
It's a Junior Mint.

249
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:13,312
Well, what did they do?

250
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,859
They sealed him up
with the mint inside.

251
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:19,649
- They left the Junior Mint in him?
- Yes.

252
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,657
Well, I-I guess it can't hurt him.

253
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,491
People eat pounds of those things.

254
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,077
Yes, they eat them.

255
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:32,376
They don't put them next to vital
organs in their abdominal cavity.

256
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,758
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

257
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:38,302
Come on up.

258
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,965
Hey.

259
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,009
This wallpaper is very good.

260
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,259
My place looks like a ski lodge.

261
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:48,105
Why'd you force that mint on me?
I didn't want the mint!

262
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:50,348
- What? I didn't believe you.
- How could you not?

263
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:53,436
Well, who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

264
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,944
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

265
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,568
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.

266
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:05,113
Well, just don't say anything
about this to Elaine.

267
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:09,167
Prognosis...

268
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,126
...negative.

269
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,418
Prognosis negative?

270
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,996
He's not doing well.
The doctors don't know what it is.

271
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,048
They're baffled.

272
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,258
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,964
Just my luck, you know? Just when
he was getting thin and attractive.

274
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,847
You know, Jerry, you should
buy some of his art.

275
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,147
- That would really lift his spirits.
- It's that bleak?

276
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:36,268
You know, if the guy dies...

277
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,319
...the art could really be
worth something.

278
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,323
- We gotta confess.
- Really?

279
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,115
- Yes.
- We could be tried for murder.

280
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:44,656
I can't have this.
We're Leopold and Loeb.

281
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,987
- You're not saying anything.
- You can't stop me.

282
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,323
No, you're not!

283
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,586
Hey, Elaine, put me down
for some of that art.

284
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,913
Nineteen hundred dollars' worth.

285
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:03,169
Yeah, that's the spot.

286
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:04,971
What are you so tense about?

287
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,474
Nothing, really. Just a homicide.

288
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,603
That's terrific...

289
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,267
...Mulva.

290
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,693
What?

291
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,326
Mulva?

292
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,037
Mulva?

293
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,452
My...

294
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,543
My aunt's name is Mulva.
She's a masseuse.

295
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

296
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,708
Good idea.

297
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,850
What are you doing?

298
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,100
I was just looking for some gum.

299
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,064
- Or a mint.
- I have Junior Mints.

300
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,976
No! No. I mean-

301
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,649
No, thank you. No.

302
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,197
- Any news?
- No. No. You better get out of here.

303
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,077
No, wait a sec. Wait a second.

304
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,697
I don't know the name of this woman.

305
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:13,950
So when she comes out,
you introduce yourself.

306
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:16,118
- She'll be forced to say her name.
- Ten-four.

307
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,086
Okay.

308
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,246
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Kramer.

309
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:24,426
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

310
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,254
I'd better get going.
I don't wanna be late for the play.

311
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,093
- Okay.
- My cousin knows the producer.

312
00:17:31,268 --> 00:17:33,759
I may get to go backstage
and meet Olympia Dukakis.

313
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,977
- There's a name you don't forget.
- Bye, Jerry.

314
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,642
Bye.

315
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:41,270
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm George.

316
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:45,359
- Nice to meet you, George.
- Yeah. I gave it a shot.

317
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:49,362
So any word on the artiste?

318
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,114
No. I haven't heard anything.

319
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,446
- Well, I got my triangles.
- Really?

320
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,115
Yep. You know, they really
spruce up the apartment.

321
00:17:56,335 --> 00:18:00,083
Yeah, I'm sure. I gotta call the hospital.
I gotta tell them what happened.

322
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,295
- No, no. Jerry, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?

323
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,925
You could get in trouble.

324
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,800
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

325
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,460
Who are you to play God?!

326
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,430
Every man's time comes.

327
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,638
If his number is up,
who are you to interfere?

328
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,182
Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel.

329
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,430
It's about Roy Corning's condition.

330
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,682
- What? What?
- That's fantastic.

331
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:23,938
- He didn't get better, did he?
- Thank you very much. Okay. Bye-bye.

332
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:26,235
He's gonna be okay.

333
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:30,023
Where's the luck?

334
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,740
There's no luck.

335
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,080
Nineteen hundred dollars
down the drain.

336
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,293
You saved my life, George.

337
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,751
You buying my art is what
inspired me to get better.

338
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,832
I'll never forget what you did for me.

339
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,965
Well, that's great. It's really great.

340
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,505
You know, art's a great investment.

341
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,257
They'll be great in your apartment.

342
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,183
Yes, I look forward
to many years of...

343
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,186
...looking at the triangles.

344
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,554
Well, I'll-I'll wait for you outside.

345
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:04,517
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

346
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:07,686
- All right.
- That's nice.

347
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,407
Thanks, Roy.

348
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,368
Hey.

349
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:15,371
There's the guy who saved my life.

350
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,208
You know, I don't want
to totally discount...

351
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,292
...the emotional element
in your recovery...

352
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,035
...but I think there were
other factors at play here.

353
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,170
- What do you mean?
- I have no medical evidence...

354
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:31,636
...to back me up, but something
happened during the operation...

355
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,378
...that staved off that infection.

356
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,179
Something beyond science.

357
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:39,309
Something perhaps...

358
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,223
...from above.

359
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,234
Mint?

360
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,727
Those can be very refreshing.

361
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,282
So Elaine...

362
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,619
...where we going for our
big dinner on Friday?

363
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,989
I'm so sorry, Roy...

364
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:04,537
...but, actually, we are going to
the Poconos on Friday. Right, honey?

365
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,832
I don't think so.

366
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,498
Yeah, I believe that we...
We are.

367
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,420
I believe we're not.

368
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,431
- Please, can we go to the Poconos?
- Well, I'll think about it.

369
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:20,467
Great seats. You could see
the actors spitting.

370
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:21,890
Really.

371
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:24,389
Afterwards, we went backstage,
and Olympia Dukakis...

372
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,764
...autographed my playbill.

373
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,352
- Wait a second. You got her autograph?
- Yeah.

374
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,614
- Do you have it with you?
- Yeah, it's in my purse.

375
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,941
Let me see.

376
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:38,911
You know, I really think I'm
falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.

377
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:42,781
Well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

378
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,450
..."Joseph Poglia."

379
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,214
I had it autographed for my uncle.

380
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:53,053
Yeah, I know.

381
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,793
You don't know my name, do you?

382
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,386
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

383
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,764
It rhymes with a female body part.

384
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:04,973
What is it?

385
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,309
Mulva?

386
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:14,066
Gipple?

387
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:20,157
Loleola?

388
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,962
Dolores!

389
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:47,014
Ages 0 through 10, candy is
your life. There's nothing else.

390
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,479
Family, friends, school,
they're only obstacles...

391
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,893
...in the way of getting more candy.

392
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,063
You have your favourite candies
that you love.

393
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,528
You know, " I love those. I hate those.

394
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,858
I hate those. I love those."

395
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,657
Only a 7-year-old kid can actually
taste the difference...

396
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,080
...between, like, a red M&M
and a light-brown M&M.

397
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,204
That's two totally different things
when you're a 7-year-old.

398
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,536
"Well, your red is more of
a main-course M&M...

399
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:13,003
...but the brown, it's a more
of a mellower flavour.

400
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:16,129
It's an after-dinner M&M, really."
