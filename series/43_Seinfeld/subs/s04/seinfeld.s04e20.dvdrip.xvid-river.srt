1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,175
A friend's getting married.

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:08,799
The bachelor party and bridal shower
are the same day, so it's conceivable...

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:10,768
...that while she's getting lingerie...

4
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,854
...he'll be at a nude bar
watching a dancer in the same outfit.

5
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,224
That is possible.

6
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:19,560
But the difference between
single and married...

7
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:21,113
...is the form of government.

8
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,235
You see, when you're single
you're the dictator of your own life.

9
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:25,571
I have complete power.

10
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:28,994
When I give the order to fall asleep
on the sofa with the TV on...

11
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,655
...no one can overrule me.

12
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,415
When you're married you are part
of a vast decision-making body.

13
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,461
Before anything's done,
there are meetings.

14
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,541
Committees have to study
the situation.

15
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:42,923
And this is if the marriage works.

16
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:44,754
That's what so painful about divorce:

17
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,385
You've been impeached.
You weren't even the president.

18
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:57,107
Hey, is it my imagination,
or do really good-looking women...

19
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,848
...walk a lot faster
than everybody else?

20
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,937
We don't walk that fast.

21
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:05,696
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, we don't.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,318
The better-looking they are,
the faster they go.

23
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,405
I see them on the street
zooming around.

24
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,368
They're a blur. It's like they got
a motor on their ass.

25
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,914
Hey, Jerry, come on, let's go.
We're gonna miss the previews.

26
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:21,287
What's the big hurry?

27
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:24,039
How we getting to Scott Drake's
party on Saturday night?

28
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,756
Oh, Drake's party.
I forgot to buy a present.

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,388
What, I gotta buy a present now?

30
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,465
Of course you do.
It's an engagement party.

31
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,930
It never ends, this present stuff.

32
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:35,018
Engagement present.
Then they get married.

33
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,516
You gotta get them something.

34
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,065
Then a baby. Another present.

35
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,272
Then the baby starts getting
their presents.

36
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:41,818
I don't even like Drake.

37
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,694
- Don't like the Drake?
- Hate the Drake.

38
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:46,319
- I love the Drake.
- How could you not like the Drake?

39
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,567
- Who's the Drake?
- Who's the Drake?

40
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,819
The Drake is good.

41
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:52,948
So, what are you gonna get him?

42
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:55,162
You know, I haven't even
met the fiancée.

43
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,456
Oh, whatever!

44
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,829
Elaine, look.
I drew this triangle freehand.

45
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,330
It's a doodle. It's perfect.

46
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:05,842
So what? That's easy.

47
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,588
Easy?

48
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,804
Hi. Hey, have you gotten
a present yet for the Drake?

49
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,852
- No, no, not yet.
- You like the Drake?

50
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,931
I love the Drake.

51
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,855
I'm looking forward to meeting
the " Drakette."

52
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,984
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.

53
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,859
Boy, that's a nice triangle.

54
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:31,484
It's isosceles.

55
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:34,698
Isosceles. You know,
I love the name " Isosceles."

56
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:37,624
If I had a kid, I would
name him Isosceles.

57
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,544
Isosceles Kramer.

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,838
Hey, you know what, maybe
we should all chip in for the gift.

59
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,083
- The chip-in.
- Hey, pretty good idea?

60
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,382
- Yeah.
- The chip-in. Definitely.

61
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:51,044
Let's go to that mall in Lynbrook
before the party.

62
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:54,556
- We'll take your car. It's got room.
- No, no. My car's not running.

63
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,471
What about your father's car?

64
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,803
No. Out of the question.
I was over there today.

65
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,352
He's got the good spot
in front of the good building.

66
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,980
I know he's not gonna
want to move.

67
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:06,725
- Are you serious?
- You don't know what it means to him.

68
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,905
Once he gets it, he doesn't
go out for weeks.

69
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:12,322
How about this:
You put your car in the good spot.

70
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,198
That'll hold the good spot,
and we can get the good car.

71
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,862
- Good thinking.
- Good to meet you.

72
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,082
- So, what are we gonna get him?
- Anything we want. We're chipping in.

73
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,411
I like this area. I could live out here.

74
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,340
Yeah, we ought to all get a house
and live together out here.

75
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,548
That's a good idea.
Tell you what, chuckles...

76
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,424
...I'll give you permission
to sublet my room right now.

77
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,929
Look at this.
There's no spaces here.

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,260
- Excuse me. You getting out?
- No.

79
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,052
Why don't you take
the handicapped spot?

80
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,270
- You think?
- No, no. We'll find a space.

81
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:46,276
- There's spaces in the other lot.
- I don't wanna walk that far.

82
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:48,437
What if a handicapped person
needs it?

83
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,282
- No, come on, they don't drive.
- Yes, they do.

84
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:55,073
Have you ever seen a handicapped
person pull into a space and park?

85
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,952
The space is there,
they must drive.

86
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,455
No, they don't. If they could drive,
they wouldn't be handicapped.

87
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,950
So if you can drive,
you're not handicapped?

88
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:05,452
We're not gonna be long.
We gotta get to the party.

89
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,714
I got news for you: Handicapped
people don't even want to park there.

90
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,041
They want to be treated
just like everybody else.

91
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,092
That's why those spaces
are always empty.

92
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,836
He's right. It's the same thing
with the feminists.

93
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:18,091
They want everything to be equal.
Everything.

94
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,260
But when the check comes,
where are they?

95
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,847
What does that mean?

96
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,810
Yeah.

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,976
- All right, I'm pulling in.
- Go ahead, George.

98
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:31,521
- George!
- Come on. It's five minutes.

99
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,151
Don't forget where
the car is parked.

100
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,782
- Don't worry.
- We'll remember.

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,498
Do you believe the deal
we got on this?

102
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,418
- A big-screen TV at that price?
- What a sale, huh?

103
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,994
And how about that store
delivering it tonight.

104
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,880
We're gonna be swimming
in thank-yous.

105
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,508
Why did I get the veggieburger?

106
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:55,009
You got a veggieburger, so I got one.
It's like eating a loaf of crumbs.

107
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,753
No one's gonna have a better gift
than this big-screen TV.

108
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,675
Good for them. Love the Drake.

109
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:03,267
Got to love the Drake.

110
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,851
Hey, what's going on over here?

111
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:10,521
There must have been an accident.

112
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,896
What's going on?

113
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,363
Some jerk parked
in the handicapped spot...

114
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,370
...so this woman in a wheelchair
had to wheel up this incline.

115
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:24,666
Halfway up, her batteries gave out,
and she rolled backwards into the wall.

116
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,078
Had to take her to Saint Elizabeth's.

117
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:28,878
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,454
We're just waiting for the owner
of this car to show up.

119
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,542
He may not get out alive.

120
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:37,217
Taking up a handicapped spot.
He's gonna pay.

121
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,961
Sons of bitches.

122
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,510
Well, good luck finding them.
Him. Whatever.

123
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:46,806
I'd like to get my hands on him myself,
but I gotta take off.

124
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,559
We're gonna get you, you coward!

125
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,111
- They'll kill us.
- You happy? Are you happy now?

126
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,437
- How long you think they'll be here?
- Don't know.

127
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,025
What about the party,
the Drake?

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,276
- Oh, screw the Drake!
- I love the Drake.

129
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,279
Let's just take a bus
back into the city.

130
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:02,734
I can't leave the car here.

131
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:05,239
- Why not?
- It's my father's car.

132
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,243
- Let's smash it!
- Yeah!

133
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,494
Hey, hey! Leave the car alone!

134
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,004
All right, let's get out of here.
We gotta figure something out.

135
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,251
What are we gonna do?
How will we get out?

136
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,550
Even if we go to the car
and they're not there...

137
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:20,346
...how do we know
they're not hiding?

138
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:23,681
They have to give up some time.
They can't stay out there all night.

139
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,429
What are we, John Dillinger?

140
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,892
How did this get to be
the crime of the century?

141
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:31,682
It's not like we stuck a broomstick
in her spokes and she went flying.

142
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:35,321
What I don't get is, just because
the batteries went dead...

143
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:38,524
...you'd think she'd be able to
roll it up the hill with her hands.

144
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,944
You'd think.

145
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,525
Batteries have gone dead before.
Aren't they prepared?

146
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,910
You know, most of them
don't even have batteries.

147
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,406
Must have been a rich, spoiled
handicapped person...

148
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,208
...who didn't want to do any work.

149
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,868
Just wanted to sit in her wheelchair
and take it easy.

150
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,288
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sorry.

151
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:57,466
Our big-screen TV is probably
arriving just about now.

152
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,213
How we getting out?
We need a plan.

153
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,043
I got it. We'll give the keys to Elaine.

154
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,800
- Me?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,382
You're a woman.
Men won't hit a woman.

156
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,138
Oh, they won't?

157
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,435
Not if they don't know you.

158
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,724
I'm not going for this.
Kramer should go.

159
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,276
You know, it was all his idea.

160
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,401
No chance in hell.

161
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,444
What if we created
some sort of diversion?

162
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,488
What if we went over
and started screaming:

163
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,030
"There's the guy that took
the handicapped spot."

164
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,740
When they run the other direction,
we'll jump in the car.

165
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,491
- That's good.
- Let's give it a try.

166
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,121
If that doesn't work,
we'll give them Kramer.

167
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,348
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:07,702
You know, a lot of these scratches
will buff right out.

169
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,955
Eight years I had that car,
not a scratch on it.

170
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,624
Eight years.

171
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,838
- Two crack.
- Three dot.

172
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,841
Beautiful Mercury.
I special ordered that bench seat.

173
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,551
Dad, this other car cut us off.

174
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:29,297
They had swastikas all over it.

175
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:32,513
They were hurling
racial epithets at us.

176
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:35,523
- I could have been killed.
- I told you not to give it to him.

177
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:38,265
- Three crack.
- Four bam.

178
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,982
You know, my insurance
doesn't even cover this.

179
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,649
The whole thing is a total loss.

180
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,899
The important thing
is he didn't get hurt.

181
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,653
No, it isn't.

182
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,072
So, what are you doing now,
Georgie?

183
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:54,328
- North.
- I'm writing a pilot for NBC.

184
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:57,075
- Where the hell's my paper?
- You're writing a pilot?

185
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:00,255
With his friend Jerry Seinfeld,
the comedian.

186
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:01,918
So, what's it about?

187
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:07,511
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other
driver doesn't have any insurance...

188
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,089
...so the judge sentences him
to be Jerry's butler.

189
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,260
- It's the same situation.
- Exactly.

190
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,927
Frank, maybe you ought to
make him your butler.

191
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,940
Flower.

192
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:21,608
Every time you're with that Kramer
something happens.

193
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,946
- He's a real troublemaker.
- He didn't have anything to do with it.

194
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,523
He's all together crazy, that one.

195
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,868
And Jerry I used to think was nice.

196
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,743
I don't know what happened to him.
Nine bam.

197
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,707
- One dot.
- Two crack.

198
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,202
- Three bam.
- Mahjongg.

199
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,876
So it was a good party, huh?

200
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,134
You're welcome. You're welcome.
They loved the TV. Loved it.

201
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:46,500
Yeah.

202
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,422
Wait. I'll ask her.
That's a great idea.

203
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:51,931
Drake wants to know if we'll come out
to Mineola since we missed the party.

204
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,429
- Get something to eat.
- Sure.

205
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,642
Sure. Okay.

206
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:57,806
Don't worry, I'm taking my car.

207
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,723
Okay. All right,
we'll see you later. Bye.

208
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,146
The Drake is great.

209
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:05,406
He's so nice.
Man, I'm really happy for them.

210
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:07,649
Yeah. Well, I don't know
if I'm happy for them.

211
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:11,241
I'm glad they're happy, but frankly
it doesn't do anything for me.

212
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:16,661
<i>- Yes?
- It's me.</i>

213
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,661
Come on up.

214
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,748
Hey.

215
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,502
I just came from Saint Elizabeth's.

216
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,302
Saint Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

217
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,467
Well, the handicapped woman,
I went to see her.

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,016
- You went to see her?
- Yeah.

219
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,010
Wow, what happened?

220
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,309
I'm in love.

221
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,601
- What?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,811
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

223
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,026
I love her, Jerry.
I mean, I really love her.

224
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:47,774
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

225
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,282
She's got everything I've always
wanted in another human being.

226
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,528
Except for the walking.

227
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:58,333
What's the difference.
You don't go out that much.

228
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,503
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?

229
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,710
We gotta go out,
we gotta buy a wheelchair.

230
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:05,126
A wheelchair? What for?

231
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,339
I went to the hospital today.
I saw the woman.

232
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,048
The wheelchair is totalled.
We gotta get her another one.

233
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:11,966
Doesn't she have collision?

234
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,389
George, I'm in love with her.

235
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,433
Look, my father works
for the United Volunteers.

236
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:21,012
- Maybe he can get her one.
- No. She needs it now.

237
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,479
What about these two?
Aren't they gonna chip in?

238
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,727
Hey, we told you not to park there.

239
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,527
Can't we just fix the old one?

240
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,187
All right, all right.
Fine, George, don't chip in.

241
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,074
But some day we'll be
driving along...

242
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:35,659
...we're gonna look out the window,
see her crawling along Fifth Avenue.

243
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,914
- Is that what you want?
- All right! All right!

244
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,075
We'll buy a wheelchair.

245
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:45,380
Wheelchairs. Engagement presents.
It never ends!

246
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:52,470
This is our best model,
the Cougar 9000.

247
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:55,010
It's the Rolls-Royce
of wheelchairs.

248
00:11:55,891 --> 00:12:00,434
This is like you're almost glad
to be handicapped.

249
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:05,524
So, now, what's this got?

250
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:09,227
It's got inductive joystick,
dynamic braking, flip-up arms.

251
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:10,603
It's fully loaded.

252
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:15,196
I put Stephen Hawking in one of these
two months ago, he's loving it.

253
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,370
<i>It's rated number one by Hospital
Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.</i>

254
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,410
- How much?
- Sixty-two hundred.

255
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,789
Do you have something
a little more...

256
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,003
...less expensive?

257
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:34,803
- Hi! How you doing?
- Hey, Drake.

258
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,763
- Hi, Drake!
- Hi, Allison.

259
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:38,640
There's the TV.
Elaine, look at this.

260
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,600
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.

261
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,439
So tell me, were you guys
just blown away or what?

262
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,978
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's fantastic.

263
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,142
I am gonna make good use of this.

264
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,233
I'm watching every Super Bowl here.
Every big fight.

265
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,404
Oh, man, there is nothing
like a really big TV, huh?

266
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,404
So, where are we eating?

267
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,327
- Well, actually, Jerry-
- I'm really hungry.

268
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:04,326
We just broke up.

269
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:18,343
- When did this happen?
- About 20 minutes ago.

270
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,770
Hey, I am really sorry
about this, guys.

271
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,938
- Hell of a picture on this thing.
- Crystal clear.

272
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,610
They know how to make them.

273
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:39,285
Drake?

274
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:42,740
Are there any good Italian restaurants
around here?

275
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,706
Gagliano's. That's pretty good.

276
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,954
- Well, we should...
- Get moving. Yeah.

277
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,381
Hey, Drake, whatever happens,
I'm sure it'll be for the best.

278
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:58,051
Yeah. Take it easy.
Bye-bye, Allison.

279
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,051
The remote.

280
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:08,223
Okay, I'm just gonna put it
on top of the television...

281
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,724
Oh, God!

282
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,239
This one's about 8 years old.
Not a scratch on it.

283
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,687
It was owned by some lady...

284
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,357
...who only used it to go
to the kitchen to feed her cats.

285
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,738
- But this will get you around?
- Oh, sure.

286
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:25,321
It just doesn't have any of the frills
of the Cougar.

287
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,072
- Like what?
- For example, your tremor-damping.

288
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:31,087
- Now, what's that?
- It helps to control the direction...

289
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:34,090
...regardless of the operator's tremors
or "spasticity."

290
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,879
- Well, is it all right if I try it?
- Hop in.

291
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:40,343
Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,425
I tell you...

293
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:48,761
...when I see someone
enjoying themselves like that...

294
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,975
...it reminds me of why I got
into this business in the first place.

295
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,024
How much?

296
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,401
How about $240?

297
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:58,441
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

298
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:04,698
- Drake gave her the TV?
- Gave her all the gifts. He felt guilty.

299
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,200
Well, she can't keep it.
It's not fair. That's our TV.

300
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,284
I know it is!

301
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:15,126
Boy, I'm really starting to
dislike the Drake.

302
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,375
Hate the Drake!

303
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,217
Maybe the whole thing
was a scam.

304
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,134
Anybody can just get engaged,
get presents, and keep them.

305
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:26,676
Maybe they're on the way to Chicago
to do the whole thing all over again.

306
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:29,269
They don't know anybody in Chicago.

307
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:33,436
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast
with that nice TV.

308
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,479
- Hey.
- Hey. Guess what?

309
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:37,898
The Drake broke up.

310
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,065
The Drake broke up!

311
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,783
That's fantastic!

312
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,117
We'll get the TV back. Help defray
some of the cost of the wheelchair.

313
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,074
- I don't know about defraying.
- Why?

314
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,490
We're not getting that TV.

315
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,790
What? The engagement's off.
We get the TV back.

316
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:54,159
That's business.

317
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:56,165
The Drakette took it.

318
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,167
She can't take it.

319
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:00,002
It's not hers. It's theirs.

320
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:03,628
Once there's no theirs,
there's no hers. It should be ours.

321
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:05,640
Well, she has it.

322
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:09,927
I told you the Drake was bad.
I hate the Drake!

323
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:13,268
Maybe we should call her.

324
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,394
- Oh, come on. Who's gonna call?
- You are.

325
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,439
What? Why is it me who
always has to do these things?

326
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,689
Because that's your thing.

327
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:23,276
Calling people I hardly know...

328
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,526
...and demanding they return
expensive gifts?

329
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,327
That's my thing?

330
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:30,246
Yeah, that's your thing.

331
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,742
All right. Give me the phone.

332
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,037
That's my thing.

333
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:44,221
You know, I'm thinking
about getting a yo-yo.

334
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:46,049
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,132
I could see that.

336
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,434
<i>- Hello?
- Allison. Hi, this is Elaine.</i>

337
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:56,563
<i>I gave all the gifts to charity.</i>

338
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,734
Oh, okay. Well, thanks a lot.

339
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,611
Sorry again about you
and the Drake.

340
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,402
<i>- I hate the Drake.
- Everybody does.</i>

341
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,651
Bye-bye.

342
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:11,572
- She gave it to charity.
- Charity? That's appalling.

343
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:15,533
How could anybody be
so selfish and inconsiderate.

344
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,745
Hey. Well, I gave her
the wheelchair.

345
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,915
You should have seen
the look on her face.

346
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:24,590
Then she told me the old wheelchair
wasn't any good anyway.

347
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:29,305
So you see, George, the whole
incident was a God blessing. Yeah.

348
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,259
- You mean a blessing in disguise?
- Yeah.

349
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,148
I would also like to
take this time...

350
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,266
...to personally thank
our gracious host, Frank Costanza...

351
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:46,485
...who earned the Silver Circle Award
and is our unanimous choice...

352
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:49,908
...for the United Volunteer
representative of the month.

353
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:55,958
Due to his tireless effort, he has
personally raised over $22,000.

354
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,699
And that's a lot of wheelchairs.

355
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:04,630
On behalf of the United Volunteers
of New York, we thank you.

356
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,127
Thank you very much.

357
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:08,798
Mr. Costanza?

358
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,799
- Yes?
- You're under arrest.

359
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,599
Under arrest? What for?

360
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,223
Reckless endangerment
of public safety...

361
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,396
...in violation of traffic code 342-A.

362
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:23,396
- What's that?
- Parking in a handicap spot.

363
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,398
Let's go.

364
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,897
George! George!

365
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:33,115
Your father got arrested.
For what?

366
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:35,826
Parking in a handicapped spot.

367
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:39,249
Right in the middle
of his United Volunteer's meeting.

368
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,919
When he got back, he chased
after me with a baseball bat.

369
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,002
Holy...

370
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:48,093
Between the car being totalled,
the towing charge and the fine...

371
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,171
...there's no way I could ever
pay him back.

372
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:51,675
So, what are you gonna do?

373
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,888
I agreed to become his butler.

374
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,092
What?

375
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:02,687
- What's the matter?
- It's over.

376
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,443
- What's over?
- Me and Lola.

377
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:10,190
- Who we bought the wheelchair for?
- She dumped me.

378
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,945
- She dumped you?
- She dumped me.

379
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,360
She rolled right over me.

380
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,706
Said I was a hipster doofus.

381
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,536
Am I a hipster doofus?

382
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,493
- No.
- No.

383
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,250
Said I'm not good-looking enough.

384
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:28,875
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me. Look at my face.

385
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,053
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?

386
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,430
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.

387
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,770
She says she doesn't want to
see me again. Told me to drop dead!

388
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,523
- Drop dead.
- Boy, even I never heard that one.

389
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,521
She's pretty rough.

390
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:51,444
Well, we just blew
$240 on a wheelchair.

391
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:55,400
- $240 bucks?
- Well, it was slightly used.

392
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,536
Used?

393
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,968
I don't think you did
such a good job on these.

394
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,089
- What?
- Supposed to see your face there.

395
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,592
Do you see your face in there?

396
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,691
Yeah.

397
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,566
Oh, really?

398
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:34,117
How about that.
Went right down a hill?

399
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:38,366
Okay. All right. Bye.

400
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,954
George, forget about the shoes.
I want you to do something for me.

401
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,795
This handicapped woman
had an accident.

402
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:48,745
Somebody gave her a used wheelchair
with defective brakes.

403
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,082
Sons of bitches!

404
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,213
Pick up this big-screen TV
and deliver it to her.

405
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,760
- Big-screen TV.
- You think you can handle it?

406
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:04,393
- Yes?
- Hi, we're from the United Volunteers.

407
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,438
We've come to pick up the TV.

408
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:08,814
Great, it's right over there.

409
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,812
It's a big one.

410
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,151
- Who's got the receipt?
- I do.

411
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:21,867
- Will they give us cash?
- That's their policy.

412
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,077
I hate this mall. There are never
any spaces here.

413
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,291
Why don't you park
in front of the hydrant?

414
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:31,840
- What if there's a fire?
- Now what are the chances of that?

415
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:47,816
The handicapped parking spot
is the mirage of the parking desert.

416
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,688
Do you know that feeling?
You see it there in the distance.

417
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,316
You can't believe your eyes.
It's too good to be true.

418
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:55,148
It's a big wide spot
by the entrance.

419
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:57,696
Somehow everybody missed it.

420
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:07,660
What is the handicapped parking
situation at the Special Olympics?

421
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:15,298
They must have to just stack, like,
a hundred cars into those two spots.

422
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,006
How else are they gonna do it?
