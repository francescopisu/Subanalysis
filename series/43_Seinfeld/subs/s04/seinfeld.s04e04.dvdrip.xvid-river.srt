460
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:04,069
Well, look at your face in the mirror.

461
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:07,699
<i>- Yeah?
- It's George.</i>

462
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:09,415
Come on up.

463
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,711
- I don't believe this.
- You didn't know you were doing this?

464
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:16,204
- No, I swear.
- I'll bet this is from that kick...

465
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:19,880
...from Crazy Joe Davola. You better
see a doctor and get some x-rays.

466
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,095
Just the man I'm looking for.

467
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,591
- Me?
- Yeah. Here you go.

468
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,674
- What's this?
- A dry-cleaning bill.

469
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,593
- From that woman at NBC?
- Yeah.

470
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:32,433
- Dry cleaning bill for what?
- For vomiting on her vest.

471
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,556
Oh, come on, George.
I didn't do that on purpose.

472
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,934
- I shouldn't have to pay.
- Neither should I.

473
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,151
Jerry left the milk in the refrigerator.

474
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:41,982
- Yeah, it's your milk.
- He drank it.

475
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:43,532
- I didn't know.
- All right.

476
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,491
Well, we should all chip in, I guess.

477
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,653
- Yeah.
- How much was it to clean the vest?

478
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,454
Eighteen dollars.

479
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,078
Can you get vomit out of suede?

480
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:55,909
- I don't know.
- Yo-Yo Ma!

481
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,791
What? Yo-Yo Ma?

482
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,628
What about him?

483
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,591
- You just said, "Yo-Yo Ma."
- What's Yo-Yo Ma?

484
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:08,093
He's a cellist.

485
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,259
You should see a doctor today.

486
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:12,143
All right. Let's go. Six dollars.

487
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,221
I can't believe
she sent a cleaning bill.

488
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:15,773
I know.

489
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,147
And it doesn't really bode well
for the show.

490
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:21,651
Forget about the show. We should
take the idea to a different network.

491
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,364
Oh, yeah. Right.

492
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:26,367
Like anybody's ever gonna do this.

493
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,242
How did you get me to go with that?

494
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:31,163
A show about nothing.

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,622
It was a good idea.
Susan liked it.

496
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:40,045
And if he hadn't vomited all over her,
we'd be writing it right now.

497
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,642
What are you doing?

498
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:55,480
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing? Give me that.

499
00:25:55,814 --> 00:26:00,025
Go to your apartment and lie down.
I'll make an appointment for a doctor.

500
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,856
Hello? Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

501
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,320
No, that's my neighbour.
He's not quite himself.

502
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:09,319
He got kicked in the head.

503
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:12,152
What? Really? You're kidding.

504
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,031
Today? Yeah, sure.
We could make it. Two o'clock?

505
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,869
Yeah, we could do that.

506
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:19,954
Okay. Great. Thanks a million.

507
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,458
Okay. Bye.

508
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:23,209
- What?
- NBC.

509
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:25,465
They wanna have another meeting.

510
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:28,049
They wanna have another meeting?

511
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,092
They wanna buy it!
They wanna buy it! What did I tell you?

512
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:33,009
We'll be rich!
What are we gonna get?

513
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,391
- Fifty, 60 thousand.
- I don't know about 60.

514
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,803
Oh, it's gotta be 50.

515
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,062
You know how much
Ted Danson makes?

516
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,724
Ted Danson. How are you
comparing us to Ted Danson?

517
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:46,686
- I didn't say we're Ted Danson.
- You did. You said we're Ted Danson.

518
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:50,951
- You know, I think he wears a piece.
- Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.

519
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:55,115
- What time do you have?
- Five till.

520
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,038
See, I'm 10 minutes slow again. That's
it for this piece of junk. I've had it.

521
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,499
- The one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

522
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:03,794
We're supposed to be there.
Let's take a cab.

523
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:06,088
We'll be a little late.
I'm not taking a cab.

524
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:08,050
- I'll pay for it.
- It's not the money.

525
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,299
What is it you object to? The comfort?
The speed? The convenience?

526
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:14,849
Jerry!

527
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:16,892
- Uncle Leo!
- Hello!

528
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:18,935
Hello there. How you doing?

529
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,391
- How are you? How's Mom and Dad?
- Good. Fine.

530
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,817
Are you getting to be too much
of a big shot now to give me a call?

531
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,897
I don't hear from you anymore.

532
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:30,065
Oh, no, I've been kind
of busy, that's all.

533
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,234
You know where I just came from?

534
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,866
- Danny Barber.
- Oh, sure. Danny.

535
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:36,615
He was in the pyjama business.

536
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,450
Remember, I got my pyjamas
for free.

537
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,333
I'd come over and give you pyjamas.

538
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:41,830
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.

539
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,455
Funny thing is, I can't wear them.
I get too hot.

540
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:47,423
I sleep in my underwear
and a T-shirt.

541
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:52,337
If it gets too hot, I just take the T-shirt
off. Anyway, Danny says to me:

542
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:54,755
- "You need any pyjamas?"
- I'm sorry, Uncle Leo.

543
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,424
I really gotta get going.

544
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:01,430
Well, you gotta get going, so go.

545
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,682
We got a meeting
with the president of NBC.

546
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,735
- Nobody got a gun to your head.
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.

547
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,231
Go. Really, I understand.

548
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,611
You got an appointment.
Go to your appointment.

549
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:12,858
- I'm sorry. Really.
- You know...

550
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:15,905
...I know plenty of people
in Hollywood too.

551
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,448
Sorry. Really.

552
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:38,304
- Yeah?
- Come on, are you ready? Let's go.

553
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,556
- For what?
- What's with you?

554
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,640
I just talked to you 15 minutes ago.

555
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,851
- About what?
- The courthouse.

556
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,944
You gotta go with me to court.
I'm contesting the ticket.

557
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:52,818
- I can't. I'm going to the doctor's later.
- You gotta go.

558
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:55,067
You're my alibi.
You have to take the stand.

559
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:57,532
- Well, I can't.
- Let me remind you of something.

560
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,658
You wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for me and my helmet.

561
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:03,239
I saved your life. You would be dead!

562
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:06,538
You would cease to exist.
You'd be gone for the rest of eternity.

563
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,836
Can you begin to comprehend
what that means?

564
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:12,340
Shut up!
I'll get my coat.

565
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:14,337
Don't step on anything.

566
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:20,559
There are many things that
I think you can point to...

567
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,681
...as proof that the humans
are not smart.

568
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:28,066
But my personal favourite would have
to be that we had to invent the helmet.

569
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,942
What happened was
we were involved...

570
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:33,195
...in a lot of activities
that were cracking our heads.

571
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:37,196
We chose not to avoid doing
these activities, but instead...

572
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:39,361
...to come up with
some sort of device...

573
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:43,535
...to help us continue enjoying
our head-cracking lifestyles:

574
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,036
The helmet.

575
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,078
Not enough people
were wearing them...

576
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,460
...so we had to come up
with the helmet law...

577
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,466
...which is even stupider.
The idea behind the helmet law...

578
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:56,216
...is to preserve a brain whose
judgment is so poor...

579
00:29:56,387 --> 00:30:00,551
...it does not even try to stop
the cracking of the head it's in.

580
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,095
Did you see the look on his face?
Did you see how insulted he was?

581
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,514
What could I do?
What are we supposed to do?

582
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,020
You can't leave.

583
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:13,396
There's no excuse good
enough to justify walking away...

584
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:15,896
...from a conversation
with one of my relatives.

585
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:19,194
I didn't shave this morning.
I don't feel like myself.

586
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:24,365
You could be a fireman on
a fire truck on the way to a fire.

587
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,162
You bump into one of my relatives,
"Sorry, Uncle Leo...

588
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:31,083
...there's a building full of people
burning down. I do have to be running."

589
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:36,665
He'll go, "Go. Go ahead.
Go to your fancy fire.

590
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,505
If that's what you have to do."

591
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:43,933
- Look at this.
- Why didn't you shave this morning?

592
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:46,771
Because I shaved yesterday
in the afternoon.

593
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:48,480
- Why?
- Because of the day before.

594
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,439
It's a long story.

595
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:52,019
I can't get back on schedule.

596
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:55,777
Is that Joe Davola?

597
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:58,236
It's not him!

598
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,193
I can't live like this.
I'm being stalked.

599
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,160
Mr. Seinfeld. They're ready for you.

600
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,495
Mr. Seinfeld.
What about Mr. Costanza?

601
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,457
I'm not here?

602
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,121
All right. You promised.

603
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:13,130
You're gonna be a little more
flexible on the nothing idea.

604
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:16,298
- Just a little.
- All right. A little.

605
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,219
Okay. You all set?
You got your story?

606
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:21,716
- No.
- When he stopped me...

607
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:26,017
...I told him I was rushing because
my friend was about to commit suicide.

608
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,056
You're that friend.
All we need is a reason...

609
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,602
...why you were gonna
commit suicide.

610
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,186
I never had an air conditioner.

611
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,320
No. That's no reason to kill yourself.

612
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:42,775
Why? It gets hot at night.
You can't sleep.

613
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:44,702
You ever try to sleep in a hot room?

614
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,741
I sleep in a really hot room.
I don't wanna kill myself.

615
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:50,662
I've slept in really hot rooms
and wanted to kill myself.

616
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:54,500
No, no, that's not gonna work.
Something else.

617
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,507
I was never able
to become a banker.

618
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:04,013
Banker! So you're killing yourself...

619
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:08,226
...because your dreams of becoming
a banker have gone unfulfilled.

620
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,099
You-You-You can't live
without being a banker.

621
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:14,522
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be a banker,
I don't wanna live.

622
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,527
- You must be a banker!
- Must be a banker!

623
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,813
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.

624
00:32:27,872 --> 00:32:31,786
Story is the foundation
of all entertainment.

625
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,706
You must have a good story.
Otherwise, it's just masturbation.

626
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,755
People really have
to care about the characters.

627
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,885
Care? Forget about care. Love.

628
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,887
They have to love them. Otherwise...

629
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,722
- ...why tune in?
- Wouldn't tune in.

630
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,055
- Would they tune in?
- No tune.

631
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,438
We like to look at a show
as if it were an EKG.

632
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,778
You have your highs and your lows.
And it goes up and down.

633
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:04,320
This show will be like a heart attack.

634
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:07,446
Just a huge, massive coronary.

635
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,193
So, what you said last week
about no story...

636
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:12,282
...you're a little flexible on that now.

637
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:18,540
Is that what I said, " no story"?
Because Jerry had to tell me later.

638
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,422
He couldn't believe it.

639
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:23,877
I said- I said, "Get out of here.
No story?

640
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:26,342
Is that what I said?"

641
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,852
Well, I informed him that he
was exceeding the speed limit...

642
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:37,390
...and that's when he told me
that he was racing home...

643
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:40,603
...because his friend was
about to commit suicide.

644
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,524
And then what happened?

645
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,357
He became very loud and hysterical.

646
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:47,367
He was flailing his arms about
as he told the story...

647
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,658
...and then he threw himself
on the ground...

648
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,703
...and he grabbed me
around the legs...

649
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:55,242
...and he begged me to let him go.
And when I refused...

650
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:58,335
...that's when he began to scream,
"My friend's going to die.

651
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,833
My friend's going to die."

652
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,094
I don't know how you guys feel, but we
would like to be in business with you.

653
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,386
- We'd like to be in business.
- Love to.

654
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:11,099
- We'll do business.
- Business.

655
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,425
- Let's have business.
- This is business.

656
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:17,814
<i>Would it be possible to get
a copy of La Cocina?</i>

657
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:22,310
Your off-Broadway play.

658
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:26,323
Gee, you know...

659
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,816
It's-It's the damndest thing. I-

660
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:32,327
I moved recently,
and my files disappeared.

661
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:35,782
Now I-I don't know if
they fell off the truck...

662
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,580
...or if there was some foul play,
but let me tell you:

663
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:40,792
I am not through with
that moving company.

664
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:42,872
That's my vow to you.

665
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,712
Well, I got a feeling about you two.

666
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:47,629
And even more than that...

667
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:50,294
...I place great confidence
in this lady's judgment.

668
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:51,932
- Good judgment.
- Good judgment.

669
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:56,014
- That's a pile of judgment.
- Yes. Yes, judgment with earrings on.

670
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,729
So let's make a pilot.

671
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:05,144
I had gone up to Westchester.

672
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,440
I go every Tuesday.

673
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,450
I do charity work with the blind...

674
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,278
...in my spare time
for the Lighthouse.

675
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:19,247
I was in the middle of a game of
Parcheesi with an old blind man...

676
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,455
...and I excused myself
to call my friend...

677
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,836
...as he was very depressed lately...

678
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,878
...because he never became
a banker.

679
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:30,344
I don't understand.

680
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:33,549
You see, it had been his lifelong
dream to be a banker, and he-

681
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,096
Just the day before,
he was turned down by a bank.

682
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,475
I believe it was
the Manufacturers Hanover...

683
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:40,804
...on Lexington and 40th Street.

684
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:43,651
That was the third bank in
two weeks to turn him down...

685
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:47,566
...so I was- I was a little concerned.
I wanted to see how he was doing.

686
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:50,692
Well, Your Honour,
he was barely audible...

687
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:53,073
...but I-I distinctly recall him saying-

688
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:54,904
Hey, Yo-Yo Ma.

689
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:02,200
So I sped home to save my friend's life,
and I was stopped for speeding.

690
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:05,332
Yes, I admit I was speeding...

691
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:08,079
...but it was to save a man's life.

692
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,587
A close friend.

693
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,592
An innocent person who wanted
nothing more out of life than to love...

694
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:16,090
...to be loved and to be a banker.

695
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:18,594
So then he didn't kill himself?

696
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:20,311
No, sir, he did not.

697
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,602
But only by the grace of God.

698
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:26,818
He is in the courtroom today,
sitting right over there!

699
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:31,109
And he can corroborate
my entire testimony.

700
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,870
See! Told you! I told you!

701
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,866
- Now all we gotta do is write it.
- Yes!

702
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,118
How are we gonna do that?

703
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,121
- Hey! Congratulations.
- Thanks.

704
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,791
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

705
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,916
You know, I thought
you were mad at me.

706
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:52,251
Mr. Seinfeld, you have
a telephone call.

707
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:55,756
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?

708
00:36:57,308 --> 00:37:00,309
Hello? Mom?

709
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,137
How did you know I was here?

710
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:06,979
Oh, I was not rude to him.
That is baloney!

711
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:12,195
I couldn't talk. I had a meeting.

712
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:17,406
I don't know. He-He went off
on some thing about pyjamas.

713
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,368
When you sent me the bill, I thought
the show didn't have a chance.

714
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,162
Oh, it was only vomit.

715
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,499
Anyway, I would like to pay
for the dry cleaning.

716
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,748
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.
- Oh, no, no, no.

717
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:31,916
We all chipped in.
We have the money.

718
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,628
Well, it was $18.

719
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,641
- Okay, $18. There it is. There you go.
- All right.

720
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,727
So maybe we could get
together this weekend.

721
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:46,020
- Yeah. Call me.
- All right. Great.

722
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,684
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

723
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,234
Bye.

724
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:52,861
I can't believe she took the money.

725
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,152
Why?

726
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:58,318
I offered to pay.
She should have said no.

727
00:37:58,494 --> 00:38:00,451
She did. You insisted.

728
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:04,951
This is what the pilot should be about.
Vomiting on somebody's vest.

729
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:06,786
How much are we gonna get for this?

730
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,915
- Oh, I-I don't know.
- We gotta get 50. Gotta get 50.

731
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,841
We'll go. You call your manager.
Maybe they made an offer.

732
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,464
- Okay.
- All right, let's go, let's go.

733
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:18,714
Thirteen thousand?

734
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,343
Thirteen thousand.

735
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,592
- Apiece?
- No, for both.

736
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:26,896
That's insulting. Ted Danson
makes $800,000 an episode.

737
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,555
- Would you stop with the Ted Danson?
- Well, he does.

738
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,192
- You're nuts.
- I'm sorry.

739
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,610
I can't live knowing that Ted Danson
makes that much more than me.

740
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,191
- Who's he?
- He's somebody.

741
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:37,694
- And me?
- You're nobody.

742
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,990
- Why him? Why not me?
- He's good. You're not.

743
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:42,699
- I'm better than him.
- You're worse.

744
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:45,078
Much, much worse.

745
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,078
- There's Davola.
- What? Where?

746
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:51,004
- Where?
- Outside. I just saw him outside.

747
00:38:57,553 --> 00:38:59,047
What is it?

748
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:02,087
Oh, it's this patient.

749
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,309
Again?

750
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,268
I'm fairly certain.

751
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:09,936
I forgot to leave him an extra
prescription for his medication.

752
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:13,441
Well, so he can live without his
Valium for a couple of days.

753
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:16,446
No, you don't understand.

754
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:18,772
He could be dangerous.

755
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,571
Go outside and see if he's there.

756
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,620
I can't go. He knows we're friends.

757
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:29,918
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.

758
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:33,128
- Tell the cop.
- Good idea.

759
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:39,464
Excuse me, officer.

760
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,219
There's a guy outside, and he's a
nutjob, and he's waiting to beat me up.

761
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,510
If you could just walk me outside
and wait till I get into a cab.

762
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:49,801
Yeah, all right. Just-
Just let me get a muffin.

763
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,975
Thanks.

764
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,604
He's gonna get a muffin.
Then he'll walk us outside.

765
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:03,737
This is a great way
to go through life, isn't it?

766
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,153
Hey, he's looking at the menu now.

767
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,154
What's he looking at the menu for?

768
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,915
I thought you said he was
gonna get a muffin.

769
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,218
What are you doing?

770
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,052
- What?
- What, you're ordering food now?

771
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,679
Yeah. Yeah, I decided
to get a sandwich.

772
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,511
What happened to the muffin?

773
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:31,265
I got a little hungry.

774
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,433
All of a sudden you get hungry?

775
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,106
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

776
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:37,605
No.

777
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:40,269
Enjoy your lunch.

778
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:45,323
You know, a muffin
can be very filling.

779
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:54,164
- He's getting a sandwich now.
- I thought he was gonna have a muffin.

780
00:40:54,336 --> 00:40:56,744
All of a sudden, he gets hungry.

781
00:40:57,214 --> 00:41:00,132
- You know, a muffin can be very filling.
- I know.

782
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,675
Mr. Kramer...

783
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:07,007
...you heard the testimony so far.

784
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:09,673
Would you please tell the court,
in your own words...

785
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:13,055
...what happened on the afternoon
of September 10th?

786
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:15,686
What do you mean,
"in my own words"?

787
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,317
Whose words are they gonna be?

788
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,728
You know what I mean.

789
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:23,066
- I was very upset that day.
- And why was that?

790
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:26,534
- Would you let me say-? Let me talk.
- All right. Go ahead.

791
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:28,196
- All right.
- Okay.

792
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:33,700
I was very upset that day because
I could never become a banker.

793
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:38,083
And this failure to become a banker...

794
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:41,791
...was eating at you. Eating, eating,
eating at you inside.

795
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,010
Yeah.

796
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:49,922
It was your family that pushed you into
banking. It was their dream for you.

797
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,974
- Mr. Newman?
- I'm trying to establish...

798
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:56,356
...Mr. Kramer's fragile emotional state.
My entire case depends on it.

799
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:57,982
Continue.

800
00:41:58,192 --> 00:42:00,943
- As you were saying, Mr. Kramer?
- What was the question?

801
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:04,024
You're telling how your parents
pushed you into banking.

802
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,649
Well, my father, when I was a kid...

803
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,485
...he took me to the bank...

804
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,994
...and he lifted me up, and he pointed
to the teller, and he said:

805
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,322
"Sonny boy, take a good look
at him.

806
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,741
That's gonna be you someday."

807
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:22,454
But you never became a banker,
did you, Mr. Kramer?

808
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:25,420
Why? Why did you fail?

809
00:42:25,594 --> 00:42:27,385
I don't know.

810
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:29,097
Because you hated your father...

811
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,423
...and you would do anything
to displease him!

812
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,975
Isn't that true?

813
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:36,768
- Could you get to the speeding?
- Yes, I intend to, Your Honour.

814
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:39,893
And then, on the afternoon
of September 10th...

815
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,605
...you received a phone call,
did you not?

816
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:45,235
Phone call?

817
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,398
Yes, a phone call.

818
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:50,071
From who?

819
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,321
- From me.
- From you?

820
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:55,035
Yes, from me! From me!
I called you, remember?

821
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,663
- You called me?
- Yes, I called you, you idiot!

822
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,412
Because you were going to...

823
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:01,413
- You were going to... Remember?
- What?

824
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:03,166
You were gonna- You were gonna-

825
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,084
You were gonna do something...

826
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,586
...to yourself.
You were gonna do something.

827
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:11,514
Remember the banking! The banking!
It wasn't working out.

828
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:13,634
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call-

829
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:15,261
- Yes, a banker!
- What banker?

830
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:17,013
You're a banker!

831
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,723
- Your Honour-
- That's enough, Mr. -

832
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:21,856
Mr. Kramer is obviously
very distraught.

833
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:24,184
- I'm distraught?
- You shut up!

834
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:29,772
I demand a recess so that
I can take him outside...

835
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,658
...and help him regain
his composure.

836
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:33,784
That'll be $75.

837
00:43:33,954 --> 00:43:37,204
What's the matter with you, you jerk?
We had it all worked out!

838
00:43:42,963 --> 00:43:44,505
Is he out there? Do you see him?

839
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:46,209
I'm not sure.

840
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:48,833
Well, either you see him or you don't.

841
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:52,088
All right, I don't.

842
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,717
What is he doing?

843
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,555
Is he getting coffee?

844
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:02,184
I think he's getting coffee.

845
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:04,516
What's with this guy?

846
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,489
Did you just order coffee?

847
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:13,484
- Yeah.
- This is really too much.

848
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,986
- What is your problem?
- I'm sitting over there...

849
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:18,239
...waiting for you to finish
for 20 minutes.

850
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:21,084
Now you're drinking coffee.
That's another 10 minutes.

851
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:24,420
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

852
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:26,956
You never said anything
about the banking.

853
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,089
- You're off your rocker!
- Hey, you guys.

854
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:30,718
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

855
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:32,760
- Why are you here?
- Is Davola outside?

856
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,300
- Davola?
- Yeah.

857
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:36,264
- I didn't see him.
- Crazy Joe Davola?

858
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:39,102
- Jerry, yours is $11.
- Eleven dollars? For what?

859
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,728
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.

860
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:44,935
Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
We're gonna make the pilot.

861
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,479
The circus freak show?

862
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:48,277
- No.
- A pilot?

863
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:51,731
What do you make for something
like that? Fifty, 60 thousand?

864
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:54,816
What's the difference?
The money's not important.

865
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,279
- Hey, Newman, is that your red car?
- Yeah.

866
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:00,282
- I think you're getting a ticket.
- Run.

867
00:45:00,457 --> 00:45:02,450
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey, what are you doing?

868
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:05,117
It's after 6:00!
You can't give me a ticket!

869
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:07,786
You're not gonna get away with this.
I'll fight this.

870
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:10,669
- I've got witnesses.
- I saw the whole thing.

871
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:13,008
This would be a good idea
for the pilot.

872
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,087
Get out of here.
The vomiting is funnier.

873
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:16,634
Oh, like you know.

874
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:18,135
No. You do.

875
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:21,475
Many states now have traffic school
when you have an infraction.

876
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,638
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.

877
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:25,308
I felt bad for the instructor.

878
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:29,811
This guy goes to traffic school
every day, no matter how he drives.

879
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:32,275
What is his incentive to not speed?

880
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:35,194
He's going to traffic school, anyway.

881
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:38,661
Why not get a racecar, do 200 miles
an hour down the street?

882
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:41,913
Cop stops you. "Where you going?"
"Traffic school. " "Go ahead.

883
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:44,205
And you better hurry.
You really need it."

884
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:48,454
The punishment should be, instead
of traffic school or traffic court...

885
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,504
...just traffic.

886
00:45:50,674 --> 00:45:54,506
They sentence you
to 100 hours of traffic.

887
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:56,718
Five people drive all around you...

888
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,426
...at five miles an hour
wherever you go.

889
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,269
You're on your way to Vegas.
There isn't a car in sight.

890
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:05,054
Come on, move it.
