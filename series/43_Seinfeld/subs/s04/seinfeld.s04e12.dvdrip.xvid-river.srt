1
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:07,846
Everything on planes is tiny. Tiny
food, tiny liquor bottles, tiny pillows...

2
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:10,093
...tiny bathroom,
tiny sink, tiny soap.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,306
Everyone's in a cramped seat
working on a tiny computer.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,814
Always a small problem.
"Be a slight delay.

5
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,605
You'll be a bit late.
If you could be a little patient.

6
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,150
We're just trying to get
one of those little trucks...

7
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,362
...to pull us a little closer
to the Jetway...

8
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,442
...so you can walk down
the narrow hallway.

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:28,952
There'll be a man in a tight suit.
He'll tell you you have little time...

10
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:32,289
...to make your connecting flight.
So move it."

11
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,005
Hey, could you do me a favour?

12
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,138
Could you shut up?

13
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,217
Open the window, please.
It's hot in here.

14
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:53,762
- You're wearing that heavy jacket.
- Fine, I'll take it off. Grab the wheel.

15
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,978
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on. Just do it.

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,818
- No, I don't like to do this.
- Elaine, just get it.

17
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,143
- My hand is stuck.
- Okay, don't fool around.

18
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,646
- My hand. My hand!
- Don't- Jer- All right, fine.

19
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:05,982
Elaine.

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,819
Hey, guess what.

21
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:11,030
- This window doesn't work.
- I hate rental cars. Nothing ever works.

22
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,115
Window doesn't work.
Radio doesn't work.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,915
And it smells like a cheap hooker.

24
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,668
Or is that you?

25
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:19,505
Give me 10 bucks and find out.

26
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,963
So this worked out pretty good.

27
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,883
Them giving me an extra ticket. You
get a trip to St. Louis. I did my gig.

28
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:29,510
- You got to see your sister.
- Yeah, it worked out good.

29
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,093
- And here's the beauty.
- What?

30
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,975
George is picking us up
at the airport.

31
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:35,184
- Get out of here. Why?
- You know that awning...

32
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,431
- ...outside my building?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,434
He always brags
about his vertical leap...

34
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:42,693
...so I bet him 50 bucks that
he couldn't touch the awning.

35
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,527
- So, what happened?
- He didn't come within 2 feet of it.

36
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,817
He's waving at it.

37
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:52,528
So I told him if he picks us up at the
airport, he wouldn't have to pay me.

38
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,698
Hey, how we doing on time?

39
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,285
Timed out perfectly.

40
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,709
Drop off the car, pick up the rental-car
shuttle, we walk on the plane.

41
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:04,670
- Wait up!
- Wait up!

42
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,512
- Sorry.
- Wait!

43
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:15,554
- Where you going?
- JFK.

44
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,019
I need some small bills
for a tip, got any?

45
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,395
- Yeah. You want a 5?
- Give me a 10.

46
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,855
- You're giving him $10?
- Well, we got three bags.

47
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,150
- That's a pretty big tip.
- That's what they get.

48
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,563
- They don't get that much.
- Let's ask him.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,314
- You can't ask him.
- Let's see what he says.

50
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,486
- Jerry, we don't have time.
- Two seconds.

51
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,037
Excuse me.

52
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,996
My friend and I
were having a discussion.

53
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:39,001
We were just wondering
what you usually get for a tip.

54
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:42,419
- Depends on the person and the bag.
- How about people like us?

55
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:43,869
People like you?

56
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,207
Not much.
You don't know what you're doing.

57
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:50,216
- Come on, seriously.
- Well, since you asked.

58
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:53,093
Usually, I get $5 a bag.

59
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:55,432
- What?
- That's right.

60
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:59,433
- Five dollars a bag? I don't think so.
- Look, you asked, I told you.

61
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:02,229
You got some nerve
trying to take advantage of us.

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,271
All right, look, we're late.
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,733
- You're lucky I don't report you.
- Come on.

64
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,905
JFK.

65
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,901
Honolulu.

66
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,031
Wait up.

67
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,783
See? Never be late
for a plane with a girl.

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,744
Because a girl runs like a girl, with the
little steps and the arms flailing out.

69
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,455
You wanna make this plane,
you gotta run like a man.

70
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,875
Get your knees up!

71
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:36,552
- The flight's been cancelled?
- Everything into JFK is booked.

72
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,765
Wait, I have two seats
into La Guardia...

73
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,976
...but they're not together.
It's boarding now.

74
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,056
- We'll take them.
- We won't sit together?

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,940
So what? It's not long. You'll read.

76
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,316
What about George?
He's picking us up at Kennedy.

77
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:48,981
- We'll call him.
- There's no time.

78
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,614
- Is there time?
- There's no time.

79
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,988
There's no time.
We'll call him from the plane.

80
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,828
I have one seat in first class
and one in coach.

81
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,830
The price is the same
because your flight was cancelled.

82
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,160
Well...

83
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,994
I'll take the first class.

84
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,497
- Jerry.
- What?

85
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,295
Why should you get
the first class?

86
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,670
Elaine, have you ever
flown first class?

87
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,466
- No.
- All right, then.

88
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:12,177
You won't know
what you're missing.

89
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,836
I've flown first class, Elaine.
I can't go back to coach.

90
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:18,098
- I can't. I won't.
- You flew here coach.

91
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,767
- Yeah, that's a point.
- All right, fine. I don't care.

92
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:25,307
The plane crashes, everybody in
first class is gonna die anyway.

93
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,808
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.

94
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:33,565
Third row, right.

95
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,864
Oh, you're in here, sir.
Welcome aboard.

96
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,994
Bon voyage, Lainey.

97
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,371
Oh, excuse me.

98
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,958
Excuse me, Miss.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

99
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:54,381
What?

100
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:56,546
- Yeah, 13C. That's me.
- Sorry.

101
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,466
No, that's all right.

102
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:17,192
I never check my bags. Can't stand
that waiting in the baggage area.

103
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,406
Great.

104
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,824
Help me.

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,584
Excuse me.
I think you're in my seat.

106
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,042
Oh, really?

107
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,094
My mistake.

108
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:39,089
My mistake.

109
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:45,769
Thank you.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,895
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,440
What made you think
you could touch that awning?

112
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,190
I confused it with another awning.

113
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,691
Man.

114
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,781
- So how we doing on time?
- We're perfect.

115
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:03,242
I timed this out so we'd
pull up at the terminal...

116
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:06,119
...exactly 17 minutes after their flight
is supposed to land.

117
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,534
That gives them enough time
to get off the plane...

118
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:12,923
...pick up their bags, and be walking
out of the terminal as we roll up.

119
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,964
I tell you, it's a thing of beauty.

120
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:19,132
I cannot express to you the feeling
I get from a perfect pickup.

121
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,930
- What are you doing?
- What?

122
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:24,135
What are you getting on the
Long Island Expressway for?

123
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,311
You know what the traffic will be like?
This is a suicide mission!

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,516
- Will you relax?
- I had it perfectly timed out.

125
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,692
The Grand Central. The Van Wyck.
You've destroyed my whole timing.

126
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,237
This is the best way to go.

127
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,148
Do you know what happens
if I miss him?

128
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,779
I don't get credit for the pickup,
and I lose my $50.

129
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,109
George, there's no traffic
at this time. Come on.

130
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:43,484
Really?

131
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,414
If anything, we'll probably
get there early.

132
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:50,414
I'll have a chance to
go to the duty-free shop.

133
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,289
- The duty-free shop?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:57,631
Duty-free is the biggest
sucker deal in retail.

135
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,925
- You know how much duty is?
- Duty?

136
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:04,297
- Yeah. You know how much duty is?
- No, I don't know how much duty is.

137
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:07,678
Duty's nothing. It's like sales tax.

138
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,689
Well, I'd still like to stop
at the duty-free shop.

139
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:15,025
<i>I like to stop
At the duty-free shop</i>

140
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,816
<i>I like to stop
At the duty-free shop</i>

141
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,610
<i>I like to stop
At the duty-free shop</i>

142
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,527
So he says,
"Squeeze your breasts together."

143
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:29,489
And I say, " I thought
this was an ad for shoes."

144
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:35,037
Oh, my.

145
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,541
<i>- Is that the new Esquire?
- Yeah.</i>

146
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:40,172
Turn to page 146.

147
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,504
Coming out of the shower.

148
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:49,060
Good thing they gave you that
washcloth to cover yourself up.

149
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,389
What is this an ad for?

150
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:54,316
See those wrinkled jeans
slung over the chair?

151
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,687
Way in the background,
out of focus?

152
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:07,199
How does it look on your side?

153
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,247
We'll get there.

154
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,248
<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

155
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:20,340
<i>He's sleeping, and I have to go
to the bathroom.</i>

156
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,716
<i>Maybe he'll wake up soon.</i>

157
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,508
<i>What if my kidneys burst?</i>

158
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,096
<i>Is it worth it not to wake this man up
to damage a major organ?</i>

159
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,730
<i>I hope this disgusting slob
appreciates what I'm doing for him.</i>

160
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:38,725
<i>Yeah, make a little more noise
with your gum. That's helpful.</i>

161
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:44,116
They're not here.
You cost me 50 bucks.

162
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:48,530
Look at you. You run like a girl. Come
on. Run like a man. Lift your knees.

163
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,538
We're wasting our time here.
We're a half-hour late.

164
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,288
They probably took it
off the board!

165
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:59,131
No, there it is. Right there, 133.
And it's cancelled.

166
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:02,337
Cancelled?
Do I still get credit for the pickup?

167
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,668
- I was here.
- Let's check at the ticket counter.

168
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,049
There it is, honey.
Gate 18A, 8:30.

169
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,263
Did you see that guy?

170
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,144
- No. What guy?
- That guy. He was...

171
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:15,973
- ...standing right here.
- No, I didn't.

172
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,643
Go over to the ticket counter.

173
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,308
<i>I'll go to the gift shop and
get a copy of TIME magazine.</i>

174
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:23,736
There's supposed to be a blurb about
Jerry. I think he mentioned my name.

175
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:25,899
I know that guy.

176
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,653
Yeah.

177
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,914
<i>Gotta get my TIME magazine.
Never miss my TIME.</i>

178
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,619
Okay, get your magazine.
Let's get out of here.

179
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,581
Hey. I was gonna take that.

180
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,997
Gee, I'm sorry. I got here first.

181
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,843
- I don't care. I want the magazine.
- Okay, let's go.

182
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,500
You don't understand.
There's a blurb about me in this.

183
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,680
A blurb? You're a blurb.
Check out the cover, idiot.

184
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,343
- Let's go.
- Just give me second.

185
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:54,269
- I want the magazine!
- No.

186
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:57,687
You know what I would do to you
if I wasn't in these shackles?

187
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:01,854
But you are, Blanche.
You are in the shackles.

188
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,687
You little son of a-

189
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:09,444
<i>Oh, I can't wait to read
my TIME magazine. Last copy too.</i>

190
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,026
Maybe I'll read it tomorrow,
in the park.

191
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:16,451
Supposed to be a beautiful day.
Have a nice life...

192
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,710
...sentence, that is. You miserable...

193
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,668
They're on a different flight.

194
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,462
They're scheduled to land
in half an hour at La Guardia.

195
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,880
La Guardia? Right, come on.

196
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,334
- Wait a second.
- Come on.

197
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,882
- Where do I know that guy from?
- We gotta go, come on.

198
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:36,725
<i>Wake up, you human slug.
Wake up.</i>

199
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,387
<i>Wake up!</i>

200
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,812
<i>I can't hold it anymore.</i>

201
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:47,770
Excuse me.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

202
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,324
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

203
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,034
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,240
Can you move that?

205
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:59,037
Would you move
your seat up, please?

206
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,845
Oh, my, that is refreshing.

207
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,925
Would you care for some slippers?

208
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:18,308
- Sounds lovely.
- Here you are.

209
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,685
Thank you very much. May I?

210
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,100
Please.

211
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,568
Why, it's a perfect fit.
You must be Cinderella.

212
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,615
My name is not mentioned
in this blurb.

213
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,411
- That's it. It's Grossbard.
- Do you believe this?

214
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:43,206
- Nowhere to be found.
- I knew that face looked familiar.

215
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,214
- It's Grossbard.
- Who's Grossbard?

216
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,383
When I lived on Third Avenue
and 18th Street, 20 years ago...

217
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:52,671
...I had this roommate who was
always behind in his rent.

218
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:57,758
One month, he asked me to loan him
his share of the rent, 240 bucks.

219
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,643
He took the cash and...

220
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,010
...disappears.

221
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,391
I tried to find him. I went to his
girlfriend's house, even his family.

222
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,140
Never got that money back.
He screwed me.

223
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,810
And that's the guy. John Grossbard.

224
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,824
Kramer, come on.
It was 240 bucks 20 years ago.

225
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,115
- I'm gonna turn around, get that guy.
- You can't.

226
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,409
- Let go of me.
- Kramer, you cannot go back.

227
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,153
Kramer, you cannot abandon
people in an airport pickup.

228
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,742
It's a binding social contract.

229
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:27,167
We must go forward. Not back.

230
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:48,357
Tia, did you see all the flowers
in that bathroom?

231
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,101
- It's like an English garden in there.
- They're beautiful.

232
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,608
They're gardenias, mostly.

233
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:56,482
- I thought I smelled lilac.
- Yes, there are a few of those too.

234
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,036
It's almost overwhelming.

235
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:00,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.</i>

236
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,291
<i>Due to equipment problems
on the runway at La Guardia...</i>

237
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:07,871
<i>...we've been instructed by the tower
to reroute and land at JFK.</i>

238
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,288
<i>We apologize
for any inconvenience.</i>

239
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:12,209
What did he say?
What did he say?

240
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:20,556
- Well, you're not gonna believe it.
- What?

241
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,347
The plane's rerouted back
to Kennedy. We got 45 minutes.

242
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:29,098
Let's go. Listen to the bell,
Grossbard. It tolls for thee.

243
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:38,071
We have some
delicious Chateaubriand.

244
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:41,577
My personal favourite.
Or if you prefer something lighter...

245
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:46,990
...a poached Dover sole in a delicate
white-wine sauce with a hint of saffron.

246
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,577
Oh, saffron. That sounds good.

247
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:52,376
And today we're featuring wines
from the Tuscany region.

248
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,838
- Tuscany.
- Tuscany.

249
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,226
Hi. Can I get to my seat?

250
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,720
You're just gonna have to wait.

251
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:10,972
I'm right there. You just passed it.
I'm sitting next to that guy.

252
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,773
You're not supposed to get up
during the food service.

253
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:16,271
Well, nobody told me that.

254
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,774
Look. This plane is full.

255
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:22,118
I got a lot of people to serve.
Now, please.

256
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,410
You're just gonna have to wait.

257
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,871
There it is. Gate 46.
We got plenty of time.

258
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,038
Grossbard's plane
leaves in 10 minutes.

259
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,708
I've still got time to catch him.

260
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:36,587
How? He probably boarded
the plane already.

261
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,629
Give me your credit card.

262
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:41,129
- My credit card?
- Give it to me. Don't ask questions.

263
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,011
I'm not giving you my card
unless you tell me what it's for.

264
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,142
To buy a ticket
to get on that flight.

265
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:49,979
You'll spend more for the ticket
than you'll get from Grossbard.

266
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,477
I'm not gonna use the ticket.

267
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,817
I'll get my money, get off the plane,
turn your ticket in for a refund.

268
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,232
Not gonna cost you a dime.

269
00:14:56,405 --> 00:15:00,568
- Come on, give me the card.
- This is a great idea. Here.

270
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:04,527
Use this one. I get frequent flyer
miles with every purchase.

271
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,614
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

272
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,076
Get two tickets.

273
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,707
You're returning it anyway,
what's the difference?

274
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,828
- I'll get double the bonus miles.
- Yes. Yes.

275
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,088
Excuse me.

276
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:21,930
I'm sorry to make you do this,
but I got stuck in the aisle.

277
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:24,137
The flight attendant
wouldn't let me through.

278
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:26,182
There's no way
to get around that cart.

279
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,677
You're not supposed to get up
during food service.

280
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,179
I'll try and remember that.

281
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,146
Where's my meal?

282
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:41,698
He asked me. But you were gone
so long, I thought you switched seats.

283
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,817
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I didn't get a meal.

284
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:48,665
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

285
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:51,869
I would know if a tray of food
had been served to me.

286
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:56,039
- Would you?
- Yes.

287
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,791
Well, the only meal left
is a kosher meal.

288
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:02,093
A kosher meal?
I don't want a kosher meal.

289
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,551
I don't even know
what a kosher meal is.

290
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:08,009
I think it means when a rabbi
has inspected it or something.

291
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:12,183
No, no, it all has to do
with the way they kill the pig.

292
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:15,813
- Come on, but they don't eat pigs.
- They do if it's killed right.

293
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,357
- Under a rabbi's supervision.
- Oh, you know what?

294
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,106
I ordered the kosher meal.

295
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,741
- Then why didn't you take it?
- I ordered it six weeks ago. I forgot.

296
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,235
You're eating my food.

297
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,698
Hey, I got earplugs to collect.
Do you want it or not?

298
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,789
- This is the best sundae I've ever had.
- Oh, man.

299
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,421
You know what?

300
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,167
They got the fudge on the bottom.

301
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,670
You see? That enables you to
control your fudge distribution...

302
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:44,671
...as you're eating your ice cream.

303
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:48,097
I never met a man who knew
so much about nothing.

304
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,927
Thank you.

305
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:01,946
- More anything?
- More everything.

306
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,735
Look. I did good.
I got supersavers. Come on.

307
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,451
Supersavers? Are they refundable?

308
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,954
You bought nonrefundable tickets.
You idiot.

309
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,450
She talked me into it.
Said it was the best deal.

310
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:18,118
- Do you know how much this'll cost?
- I'll tell you what.

311
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:19,625
I'll split it with you, huh?

312
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,470
- Listen, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay, okay.

313
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:41,645
Hey.

314
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:44,815
- How about that, huh?
- Excuse me?

315
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,817
- Do you recognize me?
- No.

316
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:49,400
- Come on. Twenty years ago.
- What?

317
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:52,413
- Eighteenth Street?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,408
Give me your money.
Where's your wallet?

319
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,994
The $240.

320
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,499
Just a minute.

321
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,587
Hey, buddy.

322
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:09,962
Kramer!

323
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,020
George!

324
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,704
Sorry. I'm sorry.

325
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,459
Sorry.

326
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:04,225
Excuse me.

327
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,899
Excuse me.

328
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:13,072
What? Oh, no, nothing for me,
thank you. I'm fine.

329
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,237
What is your name?

330
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,659
Elaine Benes.

331
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,208
You're going to have to
go back to coach.

332
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,087
But there was nobody sitting here.

333
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:27,707
Yes, but you're still not allowed.
These seats are very expensive.

334
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:31,882
No. Please don't send me back there.
I'll do anything. It's so nice up here.

335
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,807
It's so comfortable up here.
I don't wanna go back there.

336
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,932
Please, don't send me back there.

337
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,969
Oh, you got cookies.

338
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,431
You're going to have to
go back to your seat.

339
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,100
Okay, fine. I'll go back.

340
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:51,574
You know, our goal should be
a society without classes.

341
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,116
Do you realize the people up here
are getting cookies?!

342
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:02,741
What is all the racket back there?

343
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,371
You're trying to relax on the plane, and
this is what you have to put up with.

344
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:07,746
What is going on?

345
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:10,676
Sir, this woman tried
to sneak into first class.

346
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,587
Oh, you see, that's terrible.

347
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,636
The problem is
that curtain is no security.

348
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:17,641
There really should be
a locking door.

349
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,846
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,097
Sorry.

351
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:26,932
Hey!

352
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,277
Come on. Let go of me. I'm telling
you, I didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:35,944
- That guy owes me 240 bucks.
- Listen, pal, you're in big trouble.

354
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,340
Couldn't be.

355
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,682
Where are they already?
I don't see them anywhere.

356
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:05,559
I got my bags. I'm ready to go.

357
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:08,017
Yeah, you got your bags.

358
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,320
That was the worst flight
I've ever been on in my entire life.

359
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:19,036
Yeah, me too.

360
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,702
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

361
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,660
It's a business thing.

362
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:32,340
Hey.

363
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,548
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,593
Where's George?

365
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:46,470
<i>Kramer!</i>

366
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:53,353
But I have to admit that I like flying.
I like those...

367
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,401
...little bathrooms that
they have on the plane.

368
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:59,113
It's like a small apartment
of your own on the plane.

369
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,278
You go in, close the door,
the light comes on.

370
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,910
It's like a surprise party
every time you go in there.

371
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:06,407
But the worst way
of flying, I think, is standby.

372
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,577
You ever fly standby?
It never works.

373
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:12,537
That's why they call it "standby. " You
end up standing there going, " Bye.

374
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,335
I didn't...

375
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:15,754
Yeah."

376
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:18,086
I was on this plane
where the flight attendant-

377
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:21,762
It was her first day on the job. So
they didn't have a uniform for her yet.

378
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,092
And that really makes
a big difference.

379
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,594
Here's just some regular person
coming over, going:

380
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,144
"Would you bring
your seatback all the way up?"

381
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,771
"Who the hell are you?"

382
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:33,980
She says,
"I'm the flight attendant."

383
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,111
"Yeah, well,
then I'm the pilot, all right?

384
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:39,116
So why don't you sit down?
I'm about to bring her in."
