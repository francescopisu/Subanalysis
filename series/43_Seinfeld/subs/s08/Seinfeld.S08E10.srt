1
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,730
Hey, you know what?

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,170
It says "no food or drink."
You can't take that in.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,243
-Just wait here. I'll be right out.
-Wait a second. Come on.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,077
I wanna go in.

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,213
I'm just running in.

6
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,089
Come on. Come on.

7
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,905
You know what?
They don't have batteries here.

8
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,941
Let's go.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,610
Hey, Georgie's moving out.

10
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,721
-Get out.
-I'm out.

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,585
Fantastic apartment
right across from mine.

12
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,055
I can't wait for you to see.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,120
-ls it better than mine?
-Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,028
So it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-
make-your-friends-hate-you.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,394
It's better than Elaine's.

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,126
-Gotta give her a call.
-She's out.

17
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,466
-Right, the blind date.
-Well, they like to call it a setup now.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,406
I guess the blind people don't like
being associated with all those losers.

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,306
Come on,
come check out my new place.

20
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,838
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer
down at my Mini Storage.

21
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,347
Got any extra furniture there?

22
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,078
I need some more stuff to fill that
extra bedroom with a walk-in closet.

23
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,284
Oh, this is really annoying.

24
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,684
It's working already.

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,626
What is with that?

26
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,655
Well, it's coughing, Jerry.

27
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,600
It expels the diseased germs
out of the body into the air.

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,971
-Where is your key?
-Yeah, well, Newman-- He's got it.

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,872
You know, Kramer,
I rented out half of my space to you.

30
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,139
Yeah, and I rented out half that space
to Newman.

31
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,117
Mailbags?

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,779
He's storing mail in here?

33
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,854
Evidently.

34
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,122
Excuse me, George?

35
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,027
No menus.

36
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,824
No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi,
president of the tenants' association.

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,163
Oh, right. Right. Hey.

38
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,738
Hey, I love the floors in here.
It's like a gymnasium.

39
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,774
-Try and guard me. Come on.
-No, no.

40
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:29,110
George, unfortunately,
Clarence Eldridge, in 8C...

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,580
...has decided
that he wants the apartment.

42
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,880
Yeah, but you promised it to me.

43
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:38,581
Yes, but you see, Mr. Eldridge
is an Andrea Doria survivor.

44
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,025
And in light of the terrible suffering
that he's already been through...

45
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,061
...we've decided to give it to him.

46
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,594
Well...

47
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,257
...the Andrea Doria.

48
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,401
That was quite a fire.

49
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,396
-Shipwreck.
-I remember it.

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,949
Where is this guy? I hate this.

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,718
I should have brought something
to read.

52
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,518
"Cancer in laboratory animals. "

53
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,058
Excuse me. Elaine Benes?

54
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,058
-Yeah?
-An Alan Mercer called for you.

55
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,062
He said he's sorry,
but he won't be able to make it tonight.

56
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,722
He's been stabbed.

57
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,461
Stabbed?

58
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,863
More bread?

59
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,601
You ate more bread?

60
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,114
That is not the point.

61
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,749
The guy was stabbed.

62
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,612
-You find out who stabbed him?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,550
It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,281
Well, you're not going near
this hooligan anymore.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,494
I don't know.
I mean, think about it, Jerry.

66
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,892
There must be something exciting
about this guy...

67
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,831
...if he can arouse
that kind of passion.

68
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,202
I mean, to be stabworthy,
you know? It's....

69
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,906
It's kind of a compliment.

70
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,172
Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.
He could have been the one.

71
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,682
Hey, how's everybody?

72
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,978
-Hey.
-Hey.

73
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,117
There's no expiration date on this.

74
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,753
There is now.

75
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,153
You should get that cough
checked out by a doctor.

76
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,663
No, no, no. No doctors for me.

77
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:32,066
Bunch of lackeys and yes men
all toeing the company line.

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,437
Plus they botched my vasectomy.

79
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,333
-They botched it?
-I'm even more potent now.

80
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,082
-Hey.
-Hey, how's the new place?

81
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,478
Gone.

82
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,382
The tenant association
made me give it to this guy...

83
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,784
...because he was
an Andrea Doria survivor.

84
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,959
Andrea Doria? Is that the one
they did the song about?

85
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,754
Edmund Fitzgerald.

86
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,329
I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

87
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,369
No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer.
Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

88
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,596
You could fit 1 5 people
in that bathroom.

89
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,871
I think Gordon Lightfoot
was the boat.

90
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,772
Yeah, and it was rammed
by the Cat Stevens.

91
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,274
The Andrea Doria collided
with the Stockholm in dense fog...

92
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,281
...1 2 miles off the coast
of Nantucket.

93
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,918
-How do you know?
-It's in my book:

94
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,684
Astonishing Tales of the Sea.

95
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,986
Fifty-one people died.

96
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,358
Fifty-one people?

97
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,193
That's it?

98
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,499
I thought it was like a thousand.

99
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,229
There were 1 660 survivors.

100
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,430
That's no tragedy.

101
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,839
How many people you lose
on a normal cruise, 30, 40?

102
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,377
Can I take a look at that book?

103
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,640
Oh, yeah.
I also got Astounding Bear Attacks.

104
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,751
Before you go, did you talk to Newman
about getting that mail out?

105
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,716
Oh, yeah. No, he's not gonna do it.

106
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,422
-Newman?
-I guess.

107
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,592
Listen, I want you to get the mail
out of my storage unit.

108
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,703
Sometimes we don't get
what we want.

109
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,806
-What are you talking about?
-I didn't get my transfer.

110
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,408
-Transfer?
-To Hawaii.

111
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,410
The most sought after postal route
of them all.

112
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,983
The air is so dewy sweet, you don't
even have to lick the stamps.

113
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,615
But it's not to be.
So I'm hanging it up.

114
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,484
-You quit the post office?
-Kind of.

115
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,320
I'm still collecting checks,
I'm just not delivering mail.

116
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,161
Well, get it out of my storage.
It's illegal.

117
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,823
And yet it's perfectly legal
to take a man's soul...

118
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,231
...and crush it out
like a stale Pall Mall.

119
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,429
Well, the law's the law.

120
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,003
Hold on there, it's....

121
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,807
-It's a nasty cough you got there.
-What cough?

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,688
I love shrimp. I'm a shrimp eater.

123
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,250
You put shrimp in front of me,
and I'll eat it till my stomach pops.

124
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,296
No, it's okay.
I'm still just a little bit jumpy.

125
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,864
Between you and me...

126
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,196
...what happened there,
with the stabbing?

127
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,937
Just one of those things, you know.

128
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,234
What, was she just so crazy
in love with you...

129
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,343
...she just couldn't take it
anymore, or...?

130
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,342
I don't know. Could be.

131
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,606
-Alan?
-Carol?

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Was that the one?
Was that the one who stabbed you?

133
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,020
No, that was a different girl.

134
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,519
There was another
crazed ex-girlfriend?

135
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,722
Right. So I called my friend--
You know, the one who set us up?

136
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,697
I found out
he's a bad breaker-upper.

137
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,532
-Bad how?
-You know when you break up...

138
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,297
...how you say things
you don't mean?

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,066
He says mean things
you don't mean...

140
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,573
-...but he means them.
-I follow.

141
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,267
-What are you gonna do?
-Dump him.

142
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,743
I can't be with someone
who doesn't break up nicely.

143
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,178
To me, that's an important part
of a relationship.

144
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,942
What's more important?

145
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,950
Hey.

146
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,416
-What's with the dog?
-Yeah, this is Smuckers.

147
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,221
I borrowed him.

148
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,630
Yeah, we share the same affliction.

149
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,393
So I'm gonna have a vet
check us out.

150
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,868
-A vet?
-I'll take a vet over an MD any day.

151
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,169
They gotta cure a lizard, a chicken,
a pig, a frog, all on the same day.

152
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,438
So if I may jump ahead...

153
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,241
...you're gonna take dog medicine?

154
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,781
You bet we are. How smart is that?

155
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,748
See you.

156
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,121
Ahoy, Mr. Eldridge.

157
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,523
I understand you were on
the Andrea Doria.

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,928
Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

159
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,128
I tell you, I hear people really stuff
themselves on those cruise ships.

160
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,763
The buffet, that's the real ordeal,
huh, Clarence?

161
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,466
We had to abandon ship.

162
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,943
Well, all vacations
have to end eventually.

163
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,776
The boat sank.

164
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,878
According to this,
it took 1 0 hours.

165
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,385
It eased into the water like an old man
into a nice warm bath. No offense.

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,615
So, Clarence, how about...

167
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,455
...abandoning this apartment
and letting me shove off in it?

168
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,028
Is that what this is all about?

169
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,297
I don't think I like you.

170
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,966
It's my apartment, Eldridge.

171
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,437
The Stockholm
may not have sunk you, but I will.

172
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,305
What are the symptoms?

173
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,106
Well, it hurts when he swallows...

174
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,511
...especially when he drinks
orange juice.

175
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,244
I mean, dog-food juice.

176
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,581
And what's worse,
he has a nagging cough.

177
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,814
That's it. That's it.

178
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,590
Yeah, well, we've been seeing
a lot of this lately.

179
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,490
Been drinking from the toilet?

180
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,424
What? No.

181
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,164
That's disgusting.

182
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,829
So that's it? We're breaking up?

183
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,268
What? Breakup?

184
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,877
-We went out on one date.
-Okay, yeah, sure, whatever you say.

185
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,474
All right. Good, good.

186
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,639
Okay, then, well....
So I'll see you around...

187
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,375
...big head.

188
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,916
-Pardon?
-You got a big head.

189
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,520
It's too big for your body.

190
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,787
That's it?

191
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,825
That's the best you got?

192
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,068
So he's keeping the apartment.
He doesn't deserve it, though.

193
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,362
If he did suffer,
that was like 40 years ago.

194
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,061
What have you done
for me lately?

195
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,868
I've been suffering for the past 30
years up to and including yesterday.

196
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,977
If this board is impressed
with suffering...

197
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,273
...maybe you should tell them
the astonishing tales of Costanza.

198
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,420
-I should.
-Your work in this field is unparalleled.

199
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,055
I could go bummer-to-bummer
with anyone on the planet.

200
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,890
You're the man.

201
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,496
-Jerry--
-I'll be with you in a moment.

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,761
So you want a protein shake
or something?

203
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,102
I guess I should get moving
on this, huh?

204
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,262
-I'm gonna go.
-All right.

205
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,603
Hello, Newman.

206
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,041
-That mail, where is it?
-What's the difference?

207
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,203
The guy with the Hawaii transfer
got busted...

208
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,406
...for hoarding
Victoria's Secret catalogs.

209
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,342
I gotta deliver that mail.

210
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,420
Well, go ahead.
There's eight bags of it.

211
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,055
Blast.

212
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:35,489
There's no way I can handle eight
in addition to my usual load of one.

213
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,957
I'll never get to Hawaii.

214
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,598
I'll be stuck
in this apartment building forever.

215
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,861
The dream is dead.

216
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,864
-You're giving up that easy?
-I usually do.

217
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,831
-See you.
-Wait a minute, Newman.

218
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,635
You can't let this dream die.

219
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,108
You moving away is my dream too.

220
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,440
-What are you proposing?
-Whatever it takes...

221
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,881
...for as long as it takes,
wherever it takes me...

222
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,419
...so long as it takes you
away from me.

223
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,114
-An alliance?
-An alliance.

224
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,921
Now get the hell out of here.

225
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,232
Hawaii? That's why you're
helping Newman with the mail?

226
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,930
Elaine,
Newman is my sworn enemy...

227
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,374
...and he lives down the hall
from my home. My home, Elaine.

228
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,844
Where I sleep,
where I come to play with my toys.

229
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,079
Well, anyway, get this...

230
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,513
...I spoke to Alan.

231
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,984
You know, I told him
I didn't wanna see him anymore.

232
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,782
Called me big head.

233
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,254
Big head?

234
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,086
It's almost a compliment.

235
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,288
It's one of the nicest things
anyone has ever said to me.

236
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,165
-Hello? Hey, George.
-Hey.

237
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,305
-Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
-You can't make it?

238
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,033
Yeah, the tenant association has
decided to hear my side of the story...

239
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,268
...so I gotta kind of get ready.
I'll see you.

240
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,844
All right.

241
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,174
-ls he not gonna go?
-Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

242
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,519
-All right, well, I'll see you.
-All right.

243
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,886
Kramer, aren't you taking
any medication for that?

244
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,255
Yeah. Yeah, I got some pills.

245
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,862
They taste terrible.

246
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,067
-Just swallow them.
-Oh, my throat's too tender.

247
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,203
-All right, sit down.
-I don't want to.

248
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,862
-Come on. Just sit down.
-No, Jerry. What--?

249
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,268
-Lay down.
-Why?

250
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,466
-Sit down. Lean your head back.
-Hey!

251
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,236
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

252
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,972
Open it. Open it.

253
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,453
What kind of pills are these
anyway?

254
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,061
"For Smuckers"?

255
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,293
"May cause panting
and loss of fur"?

256
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,360
These are dog pills.

257
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,028
We had the same symptoms.

258
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,767
But he's a dog.
You need to see a real doctor.

259
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,171
No. No doctors.

260
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,902
All right.

261
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,774
Where are you going?

262
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,246
I'm taking the car. I gotta run errands.
Wanna go?

263
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,679
I don't know.

264
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,116
Come on, you wanna go
for a ride, huh?

265
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,318
Come on. Come on. Yeah.

266
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,521
Lady, could you move your head
a little bit?

267
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,759
-What?
-Your head. I can't see out the back.

268
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,172
Little more.

269
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,966
Little more.

270
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,309
Thank you.

271
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,686
I don't see any tissues back here.

272
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,249
Wait a minute.

273
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,990
This isn't the way to the park.

274
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,420
Where are we going?

275
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,428
I recognize this block.

276
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,555
You're taking me to the doctor.

277
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,765
So, Mom, Dad...

278
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,869
...I was hoping
that you could help me...

279
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,802
...to remember my childhood
a little more clearly.

280
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,034
I feel a draft. Let's change tables.

281
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,803
Get out of here. We have a booth.

282
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,404
Frank, I'm cold.

283
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,310
Order a hot dish.

284
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,509
Why can't we sit over there?

285
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,179
-That's not a booth.
-Who says we have to sit in a booth?

286
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,656
I didn't take the subway to New York
to sit at a table like that!

287
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,955
Well, I didn't take a subway
to be in a drafty restaurant!

288
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,655
Mom--

289
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,767
Now, George, what do you
wanna know about your childhood?

290
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,467
Actually,
I think I'm pretty clear on it.

291
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,274
Where's that breeze coming from?

292
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,940
-Kramer, out of the car. Out now.
-No, Jerry.

293
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,273
-All right. That's it. Come on.
-No. Jerry.

294
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,583
Hey. Hey, get back over here.
Kramer.

295
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,550
Get over here. You are bad.

296
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,417
Bad neighbor.

297
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,148
Kramer.

298
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,990
Just then a rescue ship emerged
from the fog and saved us.

299
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,598
It was--

300
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,733
It was the sweetest sight
my eyes ever saw.

301
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,471
Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

302
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,209
The tenant board will now hear
Mr. Costanza's testimony.

303
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,977
How'd it go? Get it all delivered?

304
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,118
-What happened?
-Kramer bit me.

305
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,796
-Bit you?
-We had an argument about me...

306
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,364
...moving to Hawaii and he locked on
to my ankle like it was a soup bone.

307
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,266
I'm hobbled.
I don't think I can do my route.

308
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,905
And they're awarding the transfer
in two days.

309
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,064
-Well, what if I delivered it?
-You?

310
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,378
-You can't deliver mail.
-Why not?

311
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,343
You're right. It's just walking around
and putting it in the boxes.

312
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,281
-Well, what am I gonna wear?
-My uniform from my rookie year.

313
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,925
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a mailman.

314
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,259
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

315
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,695
Mail on Sunday?

316
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:34,714
I was handcuffed to the bed
in my underwear...

317
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,149
...where I remained for....

318
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,653
She certainly seemed interested
in me.

319
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,760
Though she was attractive,
she was also, in fact, a Nazi.

320
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:48,059
The water that I had been
swimming in was very cold...

321
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,062
...and when I dropped the towel
there had been significant shrinkage.

322
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,967
My parents were looking at me.

323
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,200
So there I was...

324
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,969
...with the marble rye hanging
from the end of a fishing pole.

325
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,581
In closing, these stories
have not been embellished...

326
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,650
...because they need
no embellishment.

327
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,451
They are simply, horrifyingly,
the story of my life...

328
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,888
...as a short, stocky,
slow-witted bald man.

329
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,917
Thank you.

330
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,061
Oh, also...

331
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,192
...my fiancée died from licking
toxic envelopes that I picked out.

332
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,128
Thanks again.

333
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,114
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff
in the box like you told me...

334
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,807
...but sometimes it says,
"Photographs: Do not bend."

335
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,976
Do not bend.

336
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,658
Just crease, crumple, cram.
You'll do fine.

337
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,586
Hello?

338
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,622
This is he.

339
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,267
I don't understand.

340
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,700
Very well.

341
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,561
What?

342
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,732
That was the vice president
of the post office.

343
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,245
I didn't get the transfer.

344
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,041
They knew it wasn't me
doing my route.

345
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,444
How did they know?

346
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,246
Too many people got their mail.

347
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,113
Close to 80 percent.

348
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,656
Nobody from the post office has ever
cracked the 50-percent barrier.

349
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,521
It's like the three-minute mile.

350
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,822
-I tried my best.
-Exactly.

351
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,489
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

352
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,736
You know, this is your coat.

353
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,668
Damn.

354
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,614
He flew right into your head...

355
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,378
...Iike he couldn't avoid it.

356
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,489
Really?

357
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,682
Never seen that before...

358
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,157
...bird into a woman's head.

359
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,801
There's no contest.
The guy had nothing.

360
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,098
The ship went down,
he got into a lifeboat. Come on.

361
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,538
Boy, he didn't know
what he was up against.

362
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,109
So when do you move
into the apartment?

363
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,907
They're making their decision today.

364
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,278
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing...

365
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:26,049
...except that a bird
ran into my giant freak head.

366
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,825
What giant freak head?

367
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:34,659
The one that sits atop
my disproportionately puny body.

368
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,499
I'm a walking candy apple.

369
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,266
So it's actually gotten to you?

370
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,104
You're playing right into his hands.

371
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,372
What? Yeah, you're right.

372
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,416
All I have to do is call him up
and sit down with him...

373
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,576
...and show him
that it doesn't bother me.

374
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,415
You know, laugh it off.

375
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,386
Or jam a fork into his forehead.

376
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,920
-Either way.
-All right.

377
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,698
-I want to apologize for--
-Oh, please.

378
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,664
-And I hope we can get past all this.
-Past? We're way past.

379
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,333
-So you have a big head.
-So what?

380
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,939
Goes well with the bump
in your nose.

381
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,201
What?

382
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,242
Please, get help. There's a crazy,
bigheaded woman beating some guy.

383
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,817
Tell the police
it's the Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry.

384
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,987
That's some cough you got.

385
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,961
He's trying
to tell us something.

386
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,295
-What is it? Trouble?
-Trouble.

387
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,061
Trouble where? Where's trouble?

388
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,297
Old Mill.

389
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,600
Trouble at the Old Mill?
Oh, my God.

390
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,971
Good boy. Good boy.
Lead the way. Come on.

391
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,948
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

392
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,923
I'm moving in.
Alan Mercer, new neighbor.

393
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,024
But, what--?
Elaine's "big head" guy?

394
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,061
-They gave you the apartment?
-Yeah.

395
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,463
Why? Because you were stabbed...

396
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,604
...and got coffee thrown
in your face and--

397
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,932
Oh, fork in the forehead.

398
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,336
That's why
they gave you the apartment?

399
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,069
No. Just gave the super 50 bucks.

400
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,371
Wait a minute.
That is my apartment.

401
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,176
I earned it with 34 years of misery.

402
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,613
Tough luck, chinless.
