1
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,466
You seen these commercials for
indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,834
Tagamet HB?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,704
Whole country's sick
to their stomachs.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,846
You know you're supposed to take
these things before you get sick?

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,743
-What is this, a bit?
-No.

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,383
-Because I'm not in the mood.
-We're just talking.

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,746
Is this not the greatest
marketing ploy ever?

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,911
If you feel good,
you're supposed to take one.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,522
I know that tone. This is a bit.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,158
They've opened
a whole new market.

11
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,953
Medication for the well.

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,063
All right. Are you done
with your little amusement?

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,721
Then you admit it was amusing?

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,868
It was okay. But move the
"medication for the well" to the front...

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,560
...and hit the word "good" harder.

16
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,602
Great. Thanks.

17
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,706
So your firm designed
all the furniture in here?

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,782
Well, we manufacture it.

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,077
The original designs
are by Karl Farbman.

20
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,084
Oh, Farbman.

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,053
-Do you know Farbman?
-Love Farbman.

22
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,452
Most people go their whole lives
without sitting in a Farbman.

23
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,994
Well, if you call that living.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,460
Wouldn't it be great if
Farbman designed shoes?

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,573
Brett? Don't you think
that would be great? Brett?

26
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,868
After the song, babe.

27
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,906
This song.

28
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,878
So when do I meet this jerk?

29
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,420
He's not a jerk, Jer.
He only works with Karl Farbman.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,615
-Who?
-I don't know. Some designer.

31
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,283
Anyway, Brett
is so generous and sensitive.

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,760
Last night he was moved
just listening to a song.

33
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,398
-What song?
-"Desperado."

34
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,534
"Desperado"?
And you're still dating him?

35
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,635
I'll tell you who sounds
a little desperado.

36
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,138
See that salesman
twirling that umbrella?

37
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,535
I invented that.

38
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,005
That had to be invented?

39
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,440
When I started out as a comedian,
I sold umbrellas.

40
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,139
It was my idea to twirl it
to attract customers.

41
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:00,116
Oh, really? Well, why don't
we ask him about it?

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,613
-Elaine.
-Excuse me.

43
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,188
Hey, how you doing?

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:08,418
My friend here says that he invented
that little twirl you're doing.

45
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,155
Elaine, please,
it was a long time ago.

46
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,162
The man doesn't want
a history lesson.

47
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,301
Teddy Padilac
came up with this twirl.

48
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,525
I know Teddy Padilac.

49
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,036
I worked with him on 48th and Sixth.

50
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,730
That's where he come up with it.

51
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,706
-ln his dreams.
-All right. Can we go?

52
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,780
By the way, you're doing it too fast.
You'll disorient the customers.

53
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,819
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

54
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,622
I find it disorienting.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,314
Who buys an umbrella anyway?

56
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,825
You can get them for free
in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

57
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,260
Those belong to people.

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,931
Hey. Well, this was
downstairs for you.

59
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,698
Oh, no, not more checks.

60
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,035
They're coming in faster
than I can sign them.

61
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,734
-What checks?
-Oh, you didn't hear?

62
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,846
Jerry's a big star in Japan.

63
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,209
Don't know why.
There's a one-second clip of me...

64
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,476
...in the credits of some
Japanese comedy show.

65
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,279
Yeah, The Super Terrific
Happy Hour.

66
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,016
They run it all the time. I'm starting
to get these royalty checks.

67
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,955
Look at all of those. You're rich.

68
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,890
No, each one is for like 1 2 cents.

69
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,587
It's barely worth the pain
in my hand to sign them.

70
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,430
Jerry, you need any new furniture?

71
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,472
-Why?
-Elaine's new boyfriend, you know...

72
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,837
...he's giving me
this oversized chest of drawers.

73
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,138
-It's a Farbman.
-He's giving you furniture?

74
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,078
-Who is this guy?
-Who are any of her losers?

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,547
You're on that list.

76
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,821
I gotta go home and open up
the house for the carpet cleaners.

77
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,048
You know, they're doing
my whole place for $25?

78
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,217
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

79
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,090
-Yeah. You heard of them?
-They're a crazy religious cult.

80
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,098
The carpet cleaning is just a means
for them to get into your apartment.

81
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,598
So? For a $25 cleaning, I can listen
to some pointless blather.

82
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,205
I do it. I'm not even
getting the cleaning.

83
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,670
I signed over 1 00 checks
this morning.

84
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,574
-Hello, $1 2.
-Excuse me.

85
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,438
Would you take a picture, please.

86
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,345
Oh, yeah. Sure.

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,614
I'm gonna ask this guy something.

88
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,556
Hey, nice twirl you got there.

89
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,524
You know who invented that,
don't you?

90
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,754
-Hey, are you folks from Japan?
-Yes.

91
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,592
You recognize that mug?

92
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,495
That's the funny face
that greets you...

93
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,034
...at the beginning of
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

94
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,729
-Oh, Super Terrific!
-Yeah.

95
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,771
Yeah, huh? Yeah, that's him.

96
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,504
What is he doing?

97
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,038
Well, I don't know,
but something super-terrific, I'm sure.

98
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,079
-That's funny.
-Oh, yeah, very funny.

99
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,650
And it wouldn't be impolite
to laugh at his antics.

100
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,022
Yeah, that's it. Because everybody
laughs at Jerry here in America.

101
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,287
We're pretty much finished.

102
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,697
There's just one more thing.

103
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,859
Here it comes.

104
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,133
You forgot to sign your check.

105
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,600
Sorry.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,146
You sure there isn't anything else?

107
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,381
No.

108
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,188
So that's it?

109
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,451
-Unless you need a receipt.
-I wish that was all I needed.

110
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,185
Life can be so confusing.

111
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,989
I'm searching
for answers anywhere.

112
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,927
Good luck with that.

113
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,764
Hey.

114
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,835
What's with the claw?

115
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,602
Super-terrific
carpal tunnel syndrome.

116
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,344
-There's no sign of Kramer.
-Oh, Brett.

117
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,242
-This is Jerry.
-Hi.

118
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,680
That's very funny. Elaine told me
you're some kind of comedian.

119
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,786
I'm one kind.

120
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,113
Have you seen the chest of drawers
Brett gave to Kramer?

121
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,280
-Fleckman.
-Farbman.

122
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,687
Right.

123
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,091
-You gotta see them. They're beautiful.
-I'm sure they are.

124
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,232
I'd be happy to get you some,
if that's what you're driving at.

125
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,032
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.
-Don't worry. It's no charge to you.

126
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,640
Looks like what you really need is
a decent desk for writing your skits.

127
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,240
I don't write skits.

128
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,969
Of course you don't.
You don't have a proper workstation.

129
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,703
I'll fax over my catalog.

130
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:26,946
Brett, Jerry doesn't have
a fax machine.

131
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,913
I'm sure things will pick up
for you soon.

132
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,254
Elaine, maybe we should get going.

133
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,726
-Wanna join us?
-Where you going, the coffee shop?

134
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,389
The coffee shop? I think we can
do a little better than that.

135
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,627
You look like you could use
a solid meal at a real restaurant.

136
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,005
-You look like you could use a--
-Jerry.

137
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,807
Three hundred dollars.

138
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,674
Hey, Mr. Oh, how much
would these run you in Tokyo?

139
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,913
Those are 30,000 yen.

140
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,949
Thirty thousand?

141
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,587
Well, these are practically free.

142
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,623
Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.

143
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,321
I feel terrible about
your friend Jerry.

144
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,863
He's upset that I gave Kramer
that chest of drawers.

145
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,432
Why do you think he's upset?

146
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,900
Well, how could he not be? Living in
that cramped little apartment...

147
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,269
...that outdated furniture,
so terribly un-Karl-Farbman-like.

148
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,709
We're not gonna talk about
Karl Farbman all night, are we?

149
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,472
I hope not.

150
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,354
Brett, is everything all right?

151
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,616
What is it?
Is there someone outside?

152
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,356
Elaine, the song.

153
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,794
For a minute, I thought
it was that urban legend...

154
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,025
...about the guy with the hook
hanging on the--

155
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,000
Elaine, could you just not talk
for one minute?

156
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,696
Sorry.

157
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,474
-No spiel?
-Not a peep.

158
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,479
They just cleaned the carpets
and left.

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,675
They call themselves a cult.

160
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,986
So you're angry
that this bizarre carpet cabal...

161
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,646
...made no attempt to abduct you?

162
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,553
They could have at least tried.

163
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,656
Maybe they thought you looked
too smart to be brainwashed.

164
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,524
-Please.
-Too dumb?

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,094
Well, Mackie's back in town.
Nice duds.

166
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,965
Yeah, it's a gift
from my Japanese friends.

167
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,835
They're known as gift-givers.

168
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,671
And tonight, we're going dancing
at the Rainbow Room.

169
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,305
Sounds like you're throwing
their money around.

170
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,506
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese.

171
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,049
I mean, that TV you watch,
that sushi you eat...

172
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,584
...even that kimono you wear...

173
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,052
...where do you think
all that money goes?

174
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,220
That's right.

175
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,882
How'd you hook up with
these guys?

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,654
They recognized Jerry from
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

177
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,957
See, you should be doing
your own show in Japan.

178
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,360
Now, they get you.

179
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,331
What kind of show am I gonna do
in Japan?

180
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,367
What did you do with
that pilot you did?

181
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,438
Yeah, the pilot.

182
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,540
Right. That had
marvelous production values.

183
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,699
I do a lot of business with
Japanese TV.

184
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,742
They broadcast
a lot of American baseball.

185
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,642
They got an office here
in New York.

186
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,647
Forget it. The pilot was awful.
It failed.

187
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,479
It failed here. Because here
every time you turn on a TV...

188
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,623
...all you see is four morons
sitting around an apartment...

189
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,314
...whining about their dates.

190
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,723
See, George is right, Jerry.
See, here you're just another apple.

191
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:28,299
But in Japan, you're an exotic fruit,
like an orange, which is rare there.

192
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,667
You had a date?

193
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,206
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

194
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,335
-Why do I need your permission?
-Because he's my butler.

195
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,451
So, what do you think?

196
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,714
We're a bit confused.

197
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,984
Why was this man Jerry's butler?

198
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,457
You see, the man
who is the butler...

199
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,690
...had gotten into
a car accident with Jerry.

200
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,630
And because he didn't have
any insurance...

201
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:08,103
...the judge decreed that
the man become Jerry's butler.

202
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,799
Is this customary in
your legal system?

203
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:15,204
No. That's what makes it
such a humorous situation.

204
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,885
I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr. Seinfeld is
very funny to Americans.

205
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:34,726
But I'm not sure this butler show
would work in Japan.

206
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,595
Oh, l-- I disagree.

207
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,795
You've-- You've been living
in America too long.

208
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,033
You've forgotten what it's like
to have no oranges.

209
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,077
Sorry. My hand is numb.

210
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,210
Yes, from endorsing checks for
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

211
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,017
You must go.

212
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,893
Well, I think
I'm on the outs with Brett.

213
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,762
I got shushed during "Desperado."

214
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,060
What does he listen to,
the all "Desperado" station?

215
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,105
He is just in his own world
when he hears that song.

216
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:21,042
It's like I'm sitting there in the car,
and he's out riding fences.

217
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,443
You know, what you need is
a song you can share.

218
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,043
Yeah, you're right.
We need to find our song.

219
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Okay. So is there any song
that you feel very strongly about?

220
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,557
I like "Witchy Woman."

221
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,458
-"Witchy Woman"?
-You know, "Witchy Woman."

222
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,957
Oh, "Witchy Woman."

223
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,065
-Hey, Elaine.
-Hey.

224
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,865
Hey, how was the Rainbow Room?

225
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,507
Well, we-- We had to leave early.

226
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,975
There was a slight monetary
discrepancy regarding the bill.

227
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,944
-Listen, could I borrow some pillows?
-What for?

228
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,983
Well, my Japanese friends
are gonna stay with me.

229
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,279
I thought they all had suites
at the Plaza.

230
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,983
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry.

231
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,489
We all don't have checks rolling in
like you do.

232
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,993
Well, what about all that money
from the kimonos I wear?

233
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,263
Well, they ran out of it.

234
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,334
I mean, Manhattan can be quite
pricey, even with 50,000 yen.

235
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,098
Fifty thousand yen?
Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

236
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,237
Evidently.

237
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,479
Oh, by the way, tell Brett that
his chest of drawers are a big hit.

238
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,910
My guests are
very comfortable in them.

239
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,876
In them?

240
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,485
You have them sleeping
in drawers?

241
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,055
Jerry, have you ever seen
the business hotels in Tokyo?

242
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,251
They sleep in tiny,
stacked cubicles all the time.

243
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,454
-They feel right at home.
-This has international incident...

244
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,031
-...written all over it.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

245
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,463
-Good night, Mr. Tanaka.
-Good night.

246
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,303
-Good night, Mr. Oh.
-Good night.

247
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,575
Good night, Mr. Yamaguchi.

248
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,556
-What is this?
-Rice Krispies.

249
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,161
East meets West, Jerry.

250
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,495
It's a lovely little bureau-and-breakfast
you're running.

251
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,964
Well, I'm off to the bank.

252
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,401
Elaine, l--

253
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,500
What do you think?

254
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,611
What are you doing?

255
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,409
That's "Witchy Woman."
I thought it could be our song.

256
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,052
"Witchy Woman" is okay for you,
but I've already got a song.

257
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,589
Oh, well, then how about
"Desperado"?

258
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,088
We can share it.

259
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,783
No. It's mine.

260
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,368
Here you go.
Snap, crackle and pop.

261
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,508
Good morning, Mr. Oh.
I gotta make up the drawer.

262
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,043
Come back in half-hour.

263
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,718
-Hey, I'll take one.
-Well, look who's back.

264
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,291
Teddy, this is the guy says
he invented the twirl.

265
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,389
Jerry Seinfeld.

266
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,894
Teddy Padilac, long time, no see.

267
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,726
What do you got
in a push-button mini?

268
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,028
Same thing we had when
you bailed on us 1 5 years ago.

269
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,104
Bailed? Come on, you knew
I wanted to be a comedian.

270
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,470
Besides, we had some good times.
Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

271
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,874
Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you
during the poncho craze of '84?

272
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,707
I almost lost my house.

273
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,974
Umbrella, buddy?

274
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,017
Now we got that damn
urban sombrero to contend with.

275
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,415
Easy, Clicky.

276
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,579
I hear you're taking credit
for the twirl.

277
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,952
Oh, it's so many years ago.
Who cares?

278
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,720
I care. Clicky cares.

279
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,491
-Look, could I just buy an umbrella?
-Yeah, sure.

280
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,497
-Two hundred dollars.
-What?

281
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,330
Special price for a real
foul-weather friend.

282
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,738
Hey, George. All right,
how about that tour, huh?

283
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,846
These guys are ready to
run the bases.

284
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,744
Kramer, it's-- It's raining.
They got the tarp on the field.

285
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,886
Listen, George, what else
can I do with these guys?

286
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,249
Bear in mind,
they're a little light on the yen.

287
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,192
Well, l-- I got the pilot
of the Jerry show.

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,261
That's perfect.
How would you guys like to watch...

289
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,092
...the Super Terrific Happy star,
Jerry Seinfeld?

290
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,530
But we are also very hungry.

291
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,398
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys
just watch the tape...

292
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,129
...and I'll get you some food.

293
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,241
-Go ahead. Yeah.
-Please.

294
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,468
Hey, peanuts!

295
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,038
George. George, got a minute?

296
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,477
George, did you call some
carpet cleaners?

297
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,810
-Are they here?
-They're in my office right now.

298
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,385
-They haven't said anything to you?
-About what?

299
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,045
What kind of a snobby,
stuck-up cult is this?

300
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,662
-Hey, Jerry.
-Oh, hi, Brett.

301
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,495
Haven't you ever
heard of an umbrella?

302
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,398
I didn't have enough money.

303
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,068
-Sure things will pick up for you.
-No, it's not that. It's....

304
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,069
Oh, no. Look at the checks.
Hours of hard work ruined.

305
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,410
Don't worry.
I can spot you the 1 2 cents.

306
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,778
No. It's not the money.

307
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,012
It's my hand.
It's crippled from writing and writing.

308
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,816
Nothing's working for you, is it?

309
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,481
Not at the moment, Brett.

310
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,150
I'd give you a ride,
but I got Karl Farbman here.

311
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,258
Thanks for stopping.

312
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,161
Brett said you ran away from him
as if he were the boogity man?

313
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,598
Boogeyman.

314
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,103
-Boogie?
-I'm quite sure.

315
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,567
Anyway, any luck
getting together on a song?

316
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,441
No. He blew out my
"Witchy Woman."

317
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,275
And he won't share "Desperado."

318
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,349
Hey, what do you think of
"Oye Como Va"?

319
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,383
Well, I'm running out of guys
here in this city, Jer.

320
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,952
Hey, great news.

321
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,585
I showed the pilot to Kramer's
Japanese friends. They loved it!

322
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,732
Really? They bought
the butler character?

323
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,595
Did I tell you that story's relatable?
That was a great show.

324
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,896
That is why I'm bringing it
back to NBC.

325
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,369
-NBC?
-Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.

326
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,103
But they told us we must go now.

327
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,838
Yeah, but now I have
my own market research.

328
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,608
Actual Japanese viewers
that loved the show.

329
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,218
-I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
-Hey, George, do me a favor.

330
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,617
If they make you an offer,
whatever it is, just take it.

331
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,595
Hey, by the way
what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

332
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,389
-Who?
-The network executive.

333
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,555
Do you think she liked me?

334
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,368
Hey, look at who's here!

335
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,480
George, come on in. Come on.

336
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,843
-I want you to come in here.
-Come on in, fat boy!

337
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,180
Get a good night's sleep,
all right, fellas? Big day tomorrow.

338
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,311
All right.

339
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,686
Last one.

340
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,967
Here you are.

341
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,630
-Where's the boys?
-No, I let them sleep in.

342
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,207
I'm on my way to cash in
their plane tickets for them.

343
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,866
They need a little food money.

344
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,173
-The meeting starts in 1 0 minutes.
-Well, I set their alarm.

345
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,873
But they did have a lot of sake
in that hot tub.

346
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,981
I'm calling Jerry.

347
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,251
-Yeah?
-Jerry!

348
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,256
The Japanese guys had sake
in the hot tub.

349
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,792
You gotta get them down here...

350
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,522
...or I don't have a focus group
to sell the pilot.

351
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,298
Uncle Leo?

352
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,729
Jerry!

353
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,229
All right, all right. I'll wake them up.

354
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,807
Testy.

355
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,778
Hello?

356
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:12,610
-Mr. Jerry, open the drawer, please.
-It's stuck.

357
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,051
The steam from the hot tub
must have warped the wood.

358
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,086
-Pull harder.
-I'm trying.

359
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,158
I can't get a grip.
My hand's had kind of a bad week.

360
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,260
Very funny. But no joking, please.

361
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,160
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

362
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,296
Brett, believe me,
you don't have to do this.

363
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,401
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this.

364
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,265
It's not as nice
as Kramer's cabinets, but it's a start.

365
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,306
Well, I promise you, Jerry is not
jealous of Kramer's cabinets.

366
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,706
Move to the back of the drawers!

367
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,573
Jerry?

368
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,172
Jerry.

369
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,407
Not the Farbman!

370
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,739
So, gentlemen, we have a deal?

371
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,259
Excuse me. Did you hire
the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

372
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,561
Yes. To clean up the coffee stain
left by Jerry Seinfeld.

373
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:44,831
Mr.... Mr. Wilhelm, what...?
What are you doing here?

374
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,169
I'm here to clean the carpets.

375
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:52,648
Most of the world is carpeted,
and one day, we will do the cleaning.

376
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,478
Him, you brainwashed?

377
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,180
What's he got that I don't have?

378
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,421
Mr. Wilhelm, you've been abducted.

379
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,324
Mr. Wilhelm,
you gotta listen to me.

380
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,192
Wilhelm?

381
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,296
My name is Tanya.

382
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,987
Brett, I'm-- I'm really sorry.

383
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,556
I didn't mean to hit you
in the head with an axe.

384
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,320
At least it was just a handle.

385
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,631
Those beautiful cabinets.

386
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,629
What am I gonna tell--?

387
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,492
-I can't remember his name.
-Fleckman?

388
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,932
Calm down, Brett. Okay?

389
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,801
You could have a concussion.
Calm down.

390
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,231
-His pulse is fine.
-Looks like a minor concussion.

391
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,459
Let me see what I can do
to relieve the swelling.

392
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,236
Doctor?

393
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,009
Doctor?

394
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,875
Doctor?

395
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,579
Doctor, I think we're losing him.
