1
00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:02,345
Whenever I see the news,

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,461
and they're hauling in
some criminal terrorist

3
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,761
psycho maniac mass murderer guy,

4
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,297
you notice he's always
covering up his face

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,064
with the newspaper,
with the jacket, with the hat?

6
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,530
What is he worried about?

7
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,530
I mean,
what is this man's reputation

8
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:19,030
that he has to worry
about this kind of exposure

9
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,497
damaging his good name?

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,052
I mean, what is he,

11
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,914
up for a big job promotion
down at the office or something?

12
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,328
Afraid the boss
will catch this on TV

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,000
and go,
"Isn't that Johnson from Sales?

14
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,163
and go,
"Isn't that Johnson from Sales?

15
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,397
"He's up in that clock tower

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,864
"picking people off one by one.

17
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,397
"I don't know
if that's the kind of man

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,897
"we want heading up
that new branch office.

19
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,397
"he should be
in Bill Collection.

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,997
I think he's got aptitude."

21
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,288
She was great.

22
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,053
You don't want to know.

23
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:03,787
Hey, remind me to tell you
what we did in Lake George, huh?

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,287
Get this.

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,587
I got it all on video.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,587
That's it. This is it.

27
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm done. Through.
It's over.

28
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,220
I'm gone. Finished. Over.

29
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,220
I will never work for you again.

30
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,553
Look at you.

31
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:18,131
You think you're
an important man?

32
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:18,720
You think you're
an important man?

33
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:19,753
Is that what you think?

34
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,220
You are a laughingstock.

35
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,720
You are a joke.

36
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,653
These people
are laughing at you.

37
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,787
You're nothing.

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,787
You have no brains,
no ability, nothing.

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,920
I quit!

40
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:39,387
Hey.
Hey.

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,620
Boy, I have really
had it with Newman.

42
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,653
He wakes me up again last night

43
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,887
at 3:00 in the morning

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
to tell me he's going
up onto the roof

45
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:47,953
to kill himself.

46
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:48,131
Well, what did you say?

47
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,953
Well, what did you say?

48
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,720
I said, "Jump."

49
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,120
He's been threatening
to do this for years.

50
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,220
I said, "If you're going
to kill yourself,

51
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:57,220
"do it already

52
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:58,720
and stop
bothering me."

53
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,453
At least I'd respect the guy
for accomplishing something.

54
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,053
What's his problem?

55
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,887
No job, no women.

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,420
He called the right guy.

57
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,220
I mean, what am I supposed
to tell him?

58
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:13,153
How much there is
for him to live for?

59
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,720
Why should I lie to him?

60
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,130
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm going to the laundry.

61
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,320
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm going to the laundry.

62
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,987
Why don't you use the machines
down in the basement?

63
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,453
Fluff and fold,
the only way to live.

64
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:26,453
I drop it off, I pick it up.

65
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,920
It's a delight.

66
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:29,720
How about if I
put a few things...

67
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,487
Wait a second.
I don't want to do that...

68
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
No, you're going over there...

69
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,620
No, I don't want
to mix in everything.

70
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,387
My guys don't know your guys.

71
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,887
You can't just lock them all
in the same machine together.

72
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
They'll start a riot.

73
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:46,387
Have you ever met my guys?

74
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,130
No, I can't say as I have.

75
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:48,153
No, I can't say as I have.

76
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,553
Well...

77
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,753
All right, put them on top.

78
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,620
On top.

79
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,953
Oh, beautiful.

80
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,220
This stuff on top
is my friend's.

81
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,653
could I get it done
in a separate machine?

82
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll have to charge you
for another machine.

83
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:03,553
Whatever it costs.

84
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,053
In fact, I would prefer it

85
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,553
if the machines are not even
touching each other,

86
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,953
because something could,
you know, jump across.

87
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:13,753
Guess what?

88
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,987
How did you know I was here?

89
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,130
Kramer. Guess what?

90
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,287
Kramer. Guess what?

91
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,487
I don't know.

92
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,553
I quit my job.

93
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:21,553
Get out of here.

94
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:23,220
I couldn't take it anymore.

95
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,487
You can have this on Monday.

96
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
What happened? Levitan?

97
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,920
I go in to use
his private bathroom,

98
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,387
everybody uses it,

99
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,087
and then I get a memo...
a memo...

100
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,087
telling me to use
the men's room in the hall.

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,553
I mean, we share it
with Pace Electronics.

102
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,587
It's disgusting.

103
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,387
You and your toilets.

104
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,253
I snapped.
It was the last straw.

105
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,887
So what are you going to do now?

106
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,887
Are you going to look

107
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,130
for something else
in real estate?

108
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:48,220
for something else
in real estate?

109
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:49,753
Nobody's hiring now.
The market's terrible.

110
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,520
So what are you going to do?

111
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,387
I like sports.
I could do something in sports.

112
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,420
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

113
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,753
In what capacity?

114
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,720
You know,

115
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:12,587
like the general manager
of a baseball team.

116
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,130
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

117
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,887
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

118
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,387
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

119
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,953
Maybe I could be, like,
an announcer,

120
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,320
like a color man.

121
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:27,553
You know, how I always make
those interesting comments

122
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:28,587
during the game?

123
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,653
Yeah, yeah,
you make good comments.

124
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:33,720
So what about that?

125
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,087
Well, you know,

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,220
they tend to give those jobs
to ex-ballplayers

127
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:42,753
and people that are, you know,
in broadcasting.

128
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,130
Well, that's really not fair.

129
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,320
Well, that's really not fair.

130
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:50,387
I know.

131
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,320
Well, okay, okay.

132
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,387
What else do you like?

133
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,487
Movies. I like to watch movies.

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,453
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,387
Do they pay people
to watch movies?

136
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,987
Projectionists.

137
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
That's true.

138
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:11,420
But you got to know
how to work the projector.

139
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,387
Right.

140
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,387
And it's probably a union thing.

141
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,130
Those unions.

142
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,153
Those unions.

143
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,887
Okay, sports...

144
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,220
movies...

145
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,787
What about a talk show host?

146
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,387
Talk show host, that's good.

147
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,953
I think I'd be good at that.

148
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:35,220
I talk to people all the time.

149
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,887
Someone told me they thought
I'd be a good talk show host.

150
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,487
Really?
Yeah, a couple of people.

151
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,920
How do you get that, though?
Where do you start?

152
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,130
Well, that's where
it gets tricky.

153
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,387
Well, that's where
it gets tricky.

154
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,220
You can't just
walk into a building and say,

155
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:53,120
"I want to be a talk show host."

156
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,887
I wouldn't think so.

157
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,620
It's all politics.

158
00:05:57,653 --> 00:05:58,820
All right, okay,

159
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,720
sports, movies, talk show hosts.

160
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:03,953
What else?

161
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:10,220
This could have been
a huge mistake.

162
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,220
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound

163
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,787
like you completely
thought this through.

164
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,253
Guess not.

165
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,130
What should I do?

166
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:18,653
What should I do?

167
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,820
Maybe you can just go back.

168
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,153
Go back?

169
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:23,220
Yeah.

170
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,087
Yeah.
Pretend like it never happened.

171
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,953
You mean just walk
into the staff meeting

172
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,087
on Monday morning

173
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,453
like it never happened?

174
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,720
Sure. You're
an emotional person.

175
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:35,787
People don't take you seriously.

176
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,653
Just go back.

177
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,387
Pretend the whole thing
never happened.

178
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,387
Never happened.

179
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,553
I was blowing off
a little steam. So what?

180
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,920
So what? You're entitled.

181
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm emotional.

182
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,131
That's right, you're emotional.

183
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:49,253
That's right, you're emotional.

184
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:50,820
Never happened.

185
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,787
Never happened.

186
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,653
To me, the most annoying thing

187
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:59,820
about the couple of times
I did work in an office

188
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,620
is that when you go in
in the morning,

189
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,387
you say hi to everyone,

190
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,987
and then for some reason,
throughout the day,

191
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,387
you have to continue
to greet these people

192
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,553
all day,
every time you see them.

193
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:12,553
You walk in,
"Morning, Bill. Morning, Bob.

194
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:13,887
How you doing? Fine."

195
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,653
10 minutes later,
you see them in the hall.

196
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,653
"How you doing?"

197
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,130
Every time you pass,

198
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:18,553
Every time you pass,

199
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,553
you got to come up
with another little greeting.

200
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,053
You know, you start
racking your brains.

201
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,053
You know,
you do the little eyebrow.

202
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,553
You know, "Hey."

203
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,487
Start coming up
with nicknames for them.

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,687
"Jimbo."

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,087
How you doing?

206
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,420
What are you doing here?

207
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:44,753
What? I work here.

208
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:46,387
I thought you quit.

209
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,130
What quit?

210
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:48,387
What quit?

211
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,253
Who quit?

212
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,220
Bill, how was your weekend?

213
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:56,820
Oh, excellent weekend.
What about your weekend?

214
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,887
Fine weekend.

215
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,387
Yeah, good weekend.

216
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,953
Went up to the Cape.
Took the kids sailing.

217
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,453
Lisa was a little scared
at first,

218
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,653
but that kids gonna be
a good sailor some day.

219
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,653
Oh, she'll be a fine sailor.

220
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,820
Ava, what happened to you
Friday afternoon?

221
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,087
Oh, I got tied up.

222
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,130
I'll bet you did.

223
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,131
I'll bet you did.

224
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,220
I want to remind everyone

225
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,053
that the 10th anniversary party

226
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,453

227
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,553
is gonna be Wednesday afternoon
at 4:00

228
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,553
in Lasky's Bar
on Madison and 48th.

229
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,253
I want all of you to be there.

230
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:33,687
This really means a lot to me.

231
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:38,987
Is that Costanza over there?

232
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,953
What are you doing here?

233
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,253
What?

234
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,420
Am I crazy or didn't you quit?

235
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,131
When?

236
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:48,753
When?

237
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,153
Friday.

238
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:51,653
Oh, what? What? That?

239
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:54,087
Are you kidding?
I didn't quit.

240
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,953
Why? You took that
seriously?

241
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,253
Oh, boy.

242
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,387
You mean "laughingstock,"
all that stuff...?

243
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,987
Come on, will you stop it?

244
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,053
"No brains, no ability."

245
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,487
Teasing.

246
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,887
Okay, I want you out of here.

247
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I don't know where
you're getting this from.

248
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,453
I...

249
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,053
You're serious, aren't you?

250
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,553
Oh, you see,

251
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,553
you just... you don't know
my sense of humor.

252
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:17,553
I mean, Dan,

253
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:18,131
don't I joke around
all the time?

254
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,553
don't I joke around
all the time?

255
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:22,820
I wouldn't say all the time.

256
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,220
You can't win.

257
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:25,887
You can't beat me.

258
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,053
That's why I'm here,
and you're there.

259
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,420
Because I'm a winner.

260
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:35,287
I'll always be a winner,

261
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,420
and you'll always be a loser.

262
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,453
"I'll always be a winner,
and you'll always be a loser."

263
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,131
This is what he said to me.

264
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:48,820
This is what he said to me.

265
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,453
Well, so that's that.

266
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:51,753
No, that's not that.

267
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:52,953
That's not that?

268
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,220
No.

269
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,453
Well, if that's not that,
what is that?

270
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,653
I got some plans.
I got plans.

271
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,153
What kind of plans?

272
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,653
What's the difference?

273
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,587
You don't want to tell me?

274
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,853
I'm going to slip him a mickey.

275
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,487
What, in his drink?

276
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,987
Are you out of your mind?

277
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,130
What are you, Peter Lorre?

278
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:18,587
What are you, Peter Lorre?

279
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,987
You don't understand.

280
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,287
He's got this big party
coming up.

281
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,887
He's been looking forward
to this for months.

282
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,953
This is going to destroy
the whole thing.

283
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,120
What if you destroy him?

284
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:28,787
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't worry.

285
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,887
It's perfectly safe.

286
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,953
I researched it.

287
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:32,953
He'll get a little woozy.

288
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,953
He might keel over.

289
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,087
Well, what does that do?

290
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,220
Big deal.

291
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,220
This is what they would do
in the movies.

292
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,453
It's the beautiful thing.

293
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,087
It's like a movie.

294
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,053
I'm going to slip him a mickey.

295
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,087
You've really gone mental.

296
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,131
Where are you going to get
this mickey?

297
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,553
Where are you going to get
this mickey?

298
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:55,153
I can't believe
I'm saying "mickey."

299
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,720
I got a source.

300
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,320
You got a mickey source?

301
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:05,120
And Elaine
is going to keep him busy.

302
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,120
Elaine?

303
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:07,487
How did you rope her into this?

304
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,287
I told her what a sexist he is,
how he cheats on his wife.

305
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,620
She knew that.

306
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:13,287
But she didn't know
he doesn't recycle.

307
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,787
What is the point

308
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,787
of all this?

309
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,053
Revenge.

310
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,130
Oh, the best revenge
is living well.

311
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,287
Oh, the best revenge
is living well.

312
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,653
There's no chance of that.

313
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,324
Did you get your laundry?

314
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:38,257
Yeah.

315
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,457
What's with you?

316
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,524
He jumped.

317
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:43,857
What?

318
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,157
Yeah, Newman jumped.

319
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,024
Did he call last night?

320
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,090
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,490
What did you say?

322
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:53,682
I said, "Wave to me
when you pass my window."

323
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:56,657
I said, "Wave to me
when you pass my window."

324
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,657
Whew.

325
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,190
Did he wave?

326
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:06,657
No. He jumped
from the second floor.

327
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,157
Mr. Papanickolas saw him

328
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,424
from across the street.

329
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,257
He's lying out there faking.

330
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,824
See, he's trying
to get back at me.

331
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,657
Oh, my God.
What?

332
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,657
What's the matter?

333
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,090
Oh, on Thursday
when I came home,

334
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,290
I had $1,500 on me.

335
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,424
For some reason,

336
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:23,683
I decided to I hide it
in my laundry bag,

337
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,424
I decided to I hide it
in my laundry bag,

338
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:28,257
and then I completely
forgot about it,

339
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,657
and then I took the laundry in

340
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,357
on Friday.

341
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:35,124
Oh, come on, let's go.

342
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,124
Where? Where?

343
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,924
To the Laundromat.

344
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,424
I never saw it.

345
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,257
Okay, come on,
give the guy his money.

346
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,990
What are you doing?

347
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,524
Hey.

348
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,257
You see that sign up there?

349
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,024
Oh, I see, so you put up a sign

350
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:49,457
so you can do whatever you want.

351
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,857
You are not a part of society.

352
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,857
Yeah, that's right,

353
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,682
because this place
is my country,

354
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:54,590
because this place
is my country,

355
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,690
and I'm the president,

356
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,990
and that's my constitution.

357
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:01,024
I'm not responsible.

358
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:03,090
So anybody leaves anything here,

359
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:04,657
you could just take it.

360
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,824
You have a license to steal.

361
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:07,190
You are like the James Bond

362
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,657
of laundry.

363
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,990
You ever hear of a bank?

364
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,490
Come on, let's go.

365
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,524
No, no, you can't let him
get away with this.

366
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,790
Which one is he?

367
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:23,157
That's him over there.

368
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,683
The one that looks
like a blowfish.

369
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:26,824
The one that looks
like a blowfish.

370
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,290
Oh, yeah, I see him.

371
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,490
Yeah.

372
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,790
Hey, thanks for doing this.

373
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,257
Why pass up the opportunity

374
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,024
to go to prison?

375
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:37,257
This is by far

376
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,357
the most exciting thing
I've ever done.

377
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,657
Yeah, it is kind of cool.

378
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,624
It's the first time in my life

379
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:43,990
I've ever gotten back
at someone.

380
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,190
I can't believe
we're doing this.

381
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,624
This is the kind of thing
they do in the movies.

382
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,490
That's exactly
what I told Jerry.

383
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,490
Really?

384
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:51,524
Yes.

385
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,682
God, I've never felt so alive.

386
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:54,883
God, I've never felt so alive.

387
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:04,424
Maybe we should call this off.

388
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,324
Come on.
What's the big deal?

389
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:07,924
We're just going to
put a little concrete

390
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:09,224
in the washing machine.

391
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:12,590
And what's going to happen?

392
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,524
Well, it'll mix up
with the water,

393
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,024
and then by the end
of the cycle,

394
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,090
it'll be a solid block.

395
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,682
If only you could put your mind
to something worthwhile.

396
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:24,324
If only you could put your mind
to something worthwhile.

397
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:27,190
You're like Lex Luthor.

398
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:29,524
You keep him busy.

399
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,790
Oh!

400
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,157
You go over there...

401
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,157
Yeah.

402
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,683
You start flirting with him,

403
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:54,324
You start flirting with him,

404
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,690
and I'll come by,

405
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,924
and while you're
keeping him busy,

406
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:58,990
I'll slip it in his drink.

407
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,324
Wouldn't it be easier

408
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,324
just to punch him in the mouth?

409
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:03,824
Come on.

410
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,657
They're terrible.

411
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,490
They got no infield.

412
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,424
Oops! Excuse me.

413
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,657
Yeah.

414
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,657
I'm gonna get some food.

415
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,157
You want some?

416
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,324
Nah.

417
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:18,524
Hi.

418
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:20,657
Hi.

419
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,757
God bless you.

420
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,124
Oh...

421
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:36,124
thank you.

422
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,657
Thank you very much.

423
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,924
Really, I mean that.

424
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,590
I am not one of those people

425
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:46,824
who gives insincere thank yous.

426
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,424
No, sir. No, sir.

427
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:51,357
When I thank somebody,
I really thank them.

428
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,424
So, thank...

429
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:53,683
you!

430
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:54,683
you!

431
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,090
You're welcome.

432
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,490
People don't say "God bless you"

433
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:03,690
as much as they used to.

434
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:04,857
Have you noticed that?

435
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,957
No.

436
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,324
So, I'm going to a nudist colony

437
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:21,090
next week.

438
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:22,990
Nudist colony?

439
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:23,683
Really?

440
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,490
Really?

441
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:25,990
Oh, yeah, yeah.

442
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,924
I love nudist colonies.

443
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:30,990
They help me unwind.
Blah.

444
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,524
I've never been
to a nudist colony.

445
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,657
Oh, really?

446
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,790
Oh, you should go.

447
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:36,824
They're great.
They're great.

448
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,590
Of course, when it's over,

449
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,657
it's hard to get used
to all this clothing,

450
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,924
so a lot of times

451
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,490
I'll just lock the door
to my office

452
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:46,257
and I'll just sit there naked.

453
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,457
Seriously?

454
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,257
Oh, yeah.

455
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,682
I usually work naked
a couple of hours a day.

456
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:55,443
I usually work naked
a couple of hours a day.

457
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,424
Glenda,

458
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,790
can I ask you a favor?

459
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:00,257
Could I have this seat?

460
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,257
What do you have
to sit here for?

461
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,024
There are plenty of other seats.

462
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,024
I can't explain.

463
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,657
It's very important
that I sit here.

464
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,824
What are you doing here anyway?

465
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,257
I thought you were fired.

466
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,957
Okay, okay.

467
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,024
Fine.

468
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:17,824
I cook naked.

469
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:21,324
I clean...

470
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,790
I clean naked.

471
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:23,683
I drive naked.

472
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,824
I drive naked.

473
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:28,357
Naked, naked, naked.

474
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,790
Who are you?

475
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:33,824
Oh, you don't want
to know, mister.

476
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,024
I'm trouble.

477
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,790
Big trouble.

478
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:48,824
What about the gentle cycle?

479
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,324
You ever use that?

480
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,290
Do you think it's effeminate

481
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,457
for a man to put clothes
in a gentle cycle?

482
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:08,257
What about fine fabrics?

483
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,424
How do you deal

484
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:10,724
with that kind of temperament?

485
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,257
What about stone-washing?

486
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,424
You ever witness one of those?

487
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,424
That must be something.

488
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:21,590
What, do they just

489
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:23,682
pummel the jeans with rocks?

490
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:24,803
pummel the jeans with rocks?

491
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:30,490
I didn't realize
it was a full box.

492
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,924
I'm going to count to three.

493
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:39,690
If you don't give up the chair,

494
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:43,024
the wig is coming off.

495
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:46,257
I don't wear a wig.

496
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,290
One...

497
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,524
No, no, no, no, no, no.

498
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:53,524
I'm sorry.

499
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:53,683
I don't really have a phone.

500
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:54,764
I don't really have a phone.

501
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,357
In fact, I don't really
have an apartment.

502
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,290
I kind of sleep around.

503
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,924
I just like to have a few drinks

504
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:05,424
and then just let the guy do

505
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:06,824
whatever he wants.

506
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,924
Uh, would you close
your eyes a second?

507
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:15,557
I want to tell you
a secret about my bra.

508
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:23,683
Hello, Rick.

509
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:24,757
Hello, Rick.

510
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,257
Hey, look who's here.

511
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,990
That's right,
Ricky-boy.

512
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,290
It's me.

513
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:30,290
You know something, Costanza?

514
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,257
I'm a very lucky man.

515
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,757
I've always been lucky.

516
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,524
Things just to seem to fall
right in my lap.

517
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:37,757
Boom!

518
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,790
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

519
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:41,924
Oh...
In fact, uh...

520
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,257
I'm glad you're here, you know?

521
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,424
Maybe I've been
a little rough on you.

522
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:47,957
Oh...

523
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,357
Why should we let petty
personal differences

524
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,290
get in the way of business?

525
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,424
I, uh...

526
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,682
I want you to come back,

527
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:54,257
I want you to come back,

528
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,590
and, uh...

529
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:58,757
you can use my bathroom
any time you want.

530
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,757
You want me to come back?

531
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,824
Yeah.

532
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:04,357
Hey, how about a toast, huh?

533
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,824
Everybody, a toast!

534
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:06,924
Rick, um...

535
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,924
Everyone,
I want to propose a toast

536
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,857
to 10 great years
at Rick Barr Properties...

537
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,024
Uh, Rick...

538
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,524
and all the people in this room

539
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:15,924
that made that possible.

540
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:16,924
Rick...

541
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,124
I'd also like to welcome back

542
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:19,124
into the fold, our...

543
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,924
our little, shrimpy friend,

544
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,090
George Costanza,

545
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:23,424
who,

546
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:23,683
although he really didn't
have a very good year...

547
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:26,457
although he really didn't
have a very good year...

548
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,290
how you blew that McConnel deal,
I'll never know,

549
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,424
but what the hell, huh?

550
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:32,590
we've always enjoyed

551
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:33,784
his antics around the office.

552
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:36,790
Anything you want
to add to this?

553
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,290
Drink up!

554
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:50,857
I like history. The Civil War.

555
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:53,683
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

556
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,357
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

557
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,757
Well, to teach something,

558
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,924
you really have to know
a lot about it.

559
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,424
I think you need a degree.

560
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,024
Yeah, that's true.

561
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,090
Hey, don't...

562
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:11,957
What?

563
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,290
Oh, my God, the money!

564
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:18,424
The $1,500!

565
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,824
Where'd you find it?

566
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:22,190
It was in my laundry.

567
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:23,682
In your laundry?
The whole time?

568
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,357
In your laundry?
The whole time?

569
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,024
I told you not
to mix in our guys.

570
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,424
What did we figure

571
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,497
the damage on that machine

572
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:34,590
would be?

573
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,857
It was about 1,200 bucks.

574
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,924
Kramer!

575
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:42,424
That's Newman.

576
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,157
I'm on the roof!

577
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,757
Well? What are you waiting for?

578
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,957
Elaine, come on,

579
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,683
take a walk with me
down to the Laundromat.

580
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:54,757
take a walk with me
down to the Laundromat.

581
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,357
I got to pay this guy the money.

582
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,424
I like horses.

583
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:59,657
Maybe I could be a stable boy.

584
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,090
You want to shoot some pool

585
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:02,757
tonight?

586
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,290
I can't.
I'm going to a movie!

587
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,424
Nah, it's probably
a union thing.

588
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,257
People like the idea of revenge.

589
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,235
Have you ever
heard the expression,

590
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:25,235
"The best revenge
is living well"?

591
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,402
I've said this.

592
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,502
In other words,

593
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:29,235
it means, supposedly,

594
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:30,835
the best way
to get back at someone

595
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:32,535
is just by being
happy and successful

596
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,368
in your own life.

597
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,502
Sounds nice.

598
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,668
Doesn't really work

599
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,035
on that Charles Bronson
kind of life.

600
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:39,668
You know what I mean?

601
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:40,835
Those movies
where his whole family

602
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,568
just gets wiped out
by some street scum.

603
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,368
You know,
maybe you could go up to him,

604
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:46,442
"Charlie, forget the .357.

605
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,877
"What you need
is a custom-made suit

606
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:48,002
"What you need
is a custom-made suit

607
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,002
"and a convertible.

608
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,935
"New carpeting, French doors,
a divan.

609
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,602
That'll show those punks."
