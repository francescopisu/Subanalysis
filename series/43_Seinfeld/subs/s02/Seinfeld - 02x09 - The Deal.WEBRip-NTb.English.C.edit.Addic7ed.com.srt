1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,974
I was watching women

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,974
in the department store
the other day trying on clothes,

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,974
and I noticed that they do it
differently from men.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,740
Women don't try on the clothes,

5
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,907
they get behind the clothes,
you see?

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,307
They take a dress off the rack,

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,974
and they hold it up
against themselves.

8
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:19,407
They can tell something
from this.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,307
They stick one leg way out.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,674
Because they need to know

11
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:27,307
if someday I'm one-legged
at a 45-degree angle,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,140
what am I going to wear?

13
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:29,200
You never see a man do that.

14
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,807
You never see a man do that.

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,974
You never see a guy
take a suit off the rack,

16
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:34,607
put his head in the neck and go,

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,974
"What do you think
about this suit?

18
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:37,607
"I think I'll get it.
Yeah, looks fine.

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,474
"Put some shoes
by the bottom of the pants.

20
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,640
"I wanna make sure.

21
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,007
"Yeah, perfect.
Now, what if I'm walking?

22
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,707
Move the shoes, move the shoes,
move the shoes, move the shoes."

23
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,140
What are you doing?

24
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,807
All right.
All right!

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,640
What's the matter with that?

26
00:00:58,674 --> 00:00:59,200
What about that one?

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,774
What about that one?

28
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:03,440
Robert Vaughn,
<i>The Helsinki Formula?</i>

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
He was good in
<i>Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i>

30
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:11,674
Guess whose birthday
is coming up soon?

31
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,307
I know. I know.

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,074
I'm having my root canal
the same week.

33
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:18,507
Oh, right. I hope you got
a good oral surgeon,

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,607
because that can be
very serious.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,174
Hey, look it, naked people.

36
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:29,200
No, I don't wanna see
the naked people.

37
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,340
No, I don't wanna see
the naked people.

38
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,007
Been a while?

39
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:36,307
I have a vague recollection

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,174
of doing something with someone,

41
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:40,174
but it was a long,
long time ago.

42
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:44,740
I think my last time
was in Rochester.

43
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,407
My hair was a lot shorter.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,174
I remember
that it's a good thing...

45
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:56,274
and someday,
I hope to do it again.

46
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:05,640
What?

47
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:06,907
What?

48
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,107
What was that look?

49
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,674
What look?

50
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:12,907
The look you just gave me.

51
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,674
I gave a look?
Yes.

52
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:16,274
What kind of a look?

53
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:17,940
I know that look.

54
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:19,107
So what was it?

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,574
Why should I tell you?

56
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,274
Well, you're the big
look expert.

57
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,840
I want to see how smart you are.

58
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:29,199
Trust me. I know the look.

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,240
Trust me. I know the look.

60
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,140
So?

61
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:36,240
What?

62
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,640
What about the look?

63
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:38,674
I don't know.

64
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:40,607
You got something on your mind?

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,674
No.

66
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:44,840
Things pop into your head.

67
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,074
You?

68
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:49,107
Things occur to me
from time to time.

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,440
Yeah. Me too.

70
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,274
Well, you can't expect

71
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,940
to just forget
the past completely.

72
00:02:58,974 --> 00:02:59,200
Well, no, of course not.

73
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,774
Well, no, of course not.

74
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,840
I mean, it's something we did.

75
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:07,340
Probably about...
what, 25 times.

76
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,007
37.

77
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:18,340
Yeah, we pretty much know
what we're doing in there.

78
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:20,274
We know the terrain.

79
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,840
No big surprises.

80
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,840
Nope.

81
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,200
What do you think?

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,974
What do you think?

83
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,974
I don't know.
What do you think?

84
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,774
Well, it's something
to consider.

85
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:35,807
Yeah.

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,574
I mean, let's say...

87
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:40,807
what if... we did?

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,107
What if?

89
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,474
Is that like the end
of the world or something?

90
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:45,507
Certainly not.

91
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,974
Why shouldn't we be able

92
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,140
to do that once in a while
if we want to?

93
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,174
I know!

94
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,307
I mean, really,
what is the big deal?

95
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,174
We go in there.

96
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,307
We're in there for a while,

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,640
then we come back out here.

98
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:59,199
That's not complicated.

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,474
That's not complicated.

100
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,607
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

101
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
It's moronic.

102
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,707
Absurd!

103
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:08,840
Of course...

104
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,974
I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

105
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,107
There are always a few.

106
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,907
I mean, if anything happened,

107
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,474
and we couldn't be friends
the way we are now,

108
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:20,740
that would really be bad.

109
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:21,974
Devastating.

110
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:27,640
Because this...
is very good.

111
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,199
And that would be good.

112
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,807
And that would be good.

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,774
That would be good too.

114
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,807
The idea is to combine
the this...

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,007
and the that,

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,940
but this cannot be disturbed.

117
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:43,640
Yeah, we just want
to take this...

118
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,340
and... add that.

119
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,507
But of course,
we'd have to figure out a way

120
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,640
to avoid the things
that cause the little problems.

121
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,140
Maybe some rules or something.

122
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:58,440
Huh.

123
00:04:58,474 --> 00:04:59,200
For example...

124
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,974
For example...

125
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,940
Now, I call you
whenever I'm inclined

126
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:05,074
and vice versa...
Right.

127
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,440
but if we did that,

128
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,974
we might feel...
a certain obligation to call.

129
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:13,440
Well, why should that be?

130
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:16,174
Oh! I have an idea.
I have an idea.

131
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:19,974
No calls the day after that.

132
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,840
Beautiful.

133
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,340
Let's make it a rule.

134
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,040
All right, sir.

135
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,199
Now, here's another little rule.

136
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,474
Now, here's another little rule.

137
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:30,574
Yeah?

138
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,640
When we see each other now,

139
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,940
we retire
to our separate quarters,

140
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,974
but sometimes when people
get involved with that,

141
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:41,307
they feel pressure...

142
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,674
to sleep over,

143
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:47,007
when that...
is not really sleep.

144
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:52,674
Sleep is separate from that,

145
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:57,640
and I don't see why sleep
got all tied up

146
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,199
and connected...

147
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,140
and connected...

148
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,340
with that.

149
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,974
Okay, okay, rule number two...

150
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,374
spending the night is optional.

151
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,007
Well, now
we're getting somewhere.

152
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,974
Good.

153
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,807
What about the kiss goodnight?

154
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,940
Tough one.

155
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:21,974
Your call.

156
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:24,974
It's bourgeois.

157
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,874
Fine.

158
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,200
Well...

159
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Well...

160
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,840
Well...

161
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,640
You ready?

162
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,540
Ready.

163
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,307
So you think
you can handle this?

164
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,507
Definitely.

165
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,116
Hey.

166
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,116
Hey.

167
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:03,716
Get the paper?

168
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,049
Not yet.
No paper.

169
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,049
I haven't been out yet.

170
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:10,382
Well, what's taking you so long?

171
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,482
So... oh!

172
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,482
Oh, yeah.

173
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,116
What's the deal with Aquaman?

174
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:27,201
Could he go on the land,

175
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,149
Could he go on the land,

176
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,116
or was he just restricted
to water?

177
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,849
No, I think I saw him on land
a couple times.

178
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:38,782
So how's
the job situation going?

179
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,449
Still looking.

180
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:41,782
Pretty bad out there.

181
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:42,949
What about you?

182
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,249
Nothing much.
I slept with Elaine last night.

183
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,882
Oxygen. I need some oxygen.

184
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,049
This is major.

185
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,049
I thought you'd like that.

186
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,982
Oh, this is huge!

187
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:57,201
I know.

188
00:07:57,202 --> 00:07:58,216
I know.

189
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,482
All right, okay.
Let's go. Details.

190
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:02,282
Nah, I can't give details.

191
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,649
You what?
I can't give details.

192
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,049
No details?

193
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:09,316
I'm not in the mood.

194
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,482
You ask me here to have lunch,

195
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,816
tell me you slept with Elaine,

196
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:19,316
and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

197
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,982
Now, you listen to me.

198
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:24,449
I want details,
and I want them right now.

199
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,982
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

200
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:27,201
You're not in the mood?

201
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,449
You're not in the mood?

202
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:31,682
Well, you get in the mood!

203
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:35,049
All right. Okay.

204
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,849
Well, we were in my apartment,
we're watching TV.

205
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,649
Where were you sitting?
On the couch.

206
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:40,149
Next to each other?
No, separate.

207
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,816
Time?
Around 11:00.

208
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,149
Okay, go ahead.

209
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,649
So she's flipping around the TV,

210
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,116
and she gets
to the naked station.

211
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,549
Oh... See, that's why
I don't have cable in my house,

212
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,316
because of that naked station.

213
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:57,200
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

214
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:57,982
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

215
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,849
I wouldn't sleep,
I wouldn't eat.

216
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,982
Eventually firemen would have
to break through the door.

217
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,716
They'd find me sitting there
in my pajamas

218
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:05,482
with drool coming down my face.

219
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:06,649
All right, all right,

220
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,016
so you're watching
the naked station.

221
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,682
And then...

222
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,016
somehow we started talking about
what if we had sex.

223
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,849
Boy, these are really
bad details.

224
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:19,782
It pains me to say this,

225
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,849
but I may be getting too mature
for details.

226
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:24,982
Oh, I hate to hear this.

227
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:27,182
Any kind of growth
really irritates me.

228
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,382
Well, I'll tell you, though,
it was really passionate.

229
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,682
Better than before?

230
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:35,682
She must have taken some kind of
seminar or something.

231
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,549
This is all too much.

232
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,482
So, what are you feeling,
what's going on?

233
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:41,982
Are you, like,
a couple again now?

234
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,049
Not exactly.

235
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,549
Not exactly?
What does that mean?

236
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:49,316
Well... we've tried
to arrange a situation

237
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:51,982
where we'll be able to do this
once in a while

238
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,116
and still be friends.

239
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,916
What?

240
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:07,049
Where are you living?

241
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,449
Are you here?

242
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,282
Are you on this planet?

243
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,982
It's impossible.
It can't be done.

244
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:15,216
Thousands of years,
people have been trying

245
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,816
to have their cake
and eat it too.

246
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,949
So all of a sudden,

247
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,149
the two of you are gonna
come along and do it.

248
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,016
Where do you get the ego?

249
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:26,482
No one can do it.
It can't be done.

250
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:27,201
I think we've
worked out a system.

251
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:27,849
I think we've
worked out a system.

252
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,549
Oh, you know what you're like?

253
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,649
You're like a pathetic gambler.

254
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:33,449
One of these losers in Las Vegas

255
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,449
who keeps thinking
he's gonna come up with a way

256
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:36,449
to win at blackjack.

257
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,316
No, this is very advanced.

258
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:41,849
We've designed a set of rules...

259
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:43,649
that we can maintain
the friendship

260
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,982
by avoiding
all the relationship pitfalls.

261
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,016
Sure.
All right, tell me the rules.

262
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,316
Okay.

263
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,016
No calls the next day.

264
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:56,982
So you have the sex,

265
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:57,201
the next day
you don't have to call.

266
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:59,449
the next day
you don't have to call.

267
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:03,316
That's pretty good.

268
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,449
Go ahead.

269
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:05,949
You ready for the second one?

270
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,216
I have to tell you,

271
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,649
I'm very impressed
with the first one.

272
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,982
Spending the night...

273
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,149
optional.

274
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:17,616
No. No, you see? You got greedy.

275
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,982
No, that's the rule.
It's optional.

276
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:23,482
I know less about women...

277
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,882
than anyone in the world,

278
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,200
but the one thing I do know

279
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:27,782
but the one thing I do know

280
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:30,716
is that they are not happy
if you don't spend the night.

281
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:34,882
It could be a hot, sweaty room
with no air conditioning,

282
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,616
and all they have
is a little army cot this wide.

283
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,549
You're not going anywhere.

284
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:41,816
I think you're wrong.

285
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,182
I hope I am.

286
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:48,682
Is this yours or the roommate's?

287
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:49,816
The roommate's.

288
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:50,982
Would she mind?

289
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:52,782
She keeps track of everything.

290
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:55,682
Yes, well, that's too bad,
because I'm taking it.

291
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,200
Thanks.

292
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:57,482
Thanks.

293
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,316
Well...

294
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,849
guess I'll get going.

295
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,882
Oh.

296
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,816
Well, I've got that root canal
tomorrow morning.

297
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,182
It'd be easier if I go home.

298
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,649
Fine. Go ahead.

299
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,816
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?

300
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,182
I'm-I'm getting the impression
there's a problem.

301
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:16,649
Just go.

302
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,016
I'm having surgery tomorrow!

303
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,682
Oh, surgery.
You're going to the dentist!

304
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,816
But you said!
It could be very serious!

305
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,316
Okay. So, fine. Go!

306
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,616
What happened to the rules?

307
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,200
Remember?
Sleeping over was optional.

308
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:27,849
Remember?
Sleeping over was optional.

309
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,282
Yeah, it's my house,
it's my option.

310
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,282
It has nothing to do
with whose house it is.

311
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,816
Oh, of course it does!

312
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:34,316
Hi.

313
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:35,382
Hi.
Hi.

314
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,649
Hi, Jerry.

315
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,149
Hi.

316
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:39,516
Such a great
improv class tonight.

317
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,649
Oh, really?

318
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,282
I did this improv...

319
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:45,816
where I pretended

320
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,649
I was working
in one of those booths,

321
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,149
you know, in an amusement park

322
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,982
where you shoot the water
in the clown's mouth,

323
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,282
and you blow up the balloon?

324
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:56,482
Uh, Tina, could you excuse us
for just one second?

325
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:57,201
Oh, yeah.

326
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,349
Oh, yeah.

327
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,082
I'll excuse you.

328
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,049
What are you doing?

329
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:09,282
I can't go if you're mad.

330
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,816
I'm not mad.

331
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,116
You still seem a little mad.

332
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,849
No, no, Jerry, I'm fine.
Really, it's okay.

333
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,316
So you're okay with everything?

334
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,216
Definitely. Are you?

335
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,049
Definitely.

336
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,201
Well... good night.

337
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,849
Well... good night.

338
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:30,516
Good ni...
What are you doing?

339
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,516
What?

340
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,816
The rules.

341
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,549
Hey, who took my cake?

342
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,914
What about jewelry?
That's a nice birthday gift.

343
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:49,614
No, no, I have to be
very careful here.

344
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,614
I don't want to send
the wrong message,

345
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,114
especially after
the other night.

346
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:55,080
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.

347
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,180
No, no, you can't get her
anything better than me.

348
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,380
Whatever I spend,
you have to spend half.

349
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:02,414
What am I supposed to get her,
Bazooka?

350
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:06,380
You don't understand.
I'm in a very delicate position.

351
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:09,347
Whatever I give her, she's gonna
be bringing in experts

352
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,229
from all over the country

353
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:10,414
from all over the country

354
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,247
to interpret
the meaning behind it.

355
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:15,714
What does she need?

356
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:18,514
Maybe there's something
that she needs.

357
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:22,880
I think I heard her say
something about a bench.

358
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,080
A bench?
What kind of a bench?

359
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,180
I don't know.
She mentioned a bench.

360
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,580
What, like at a bus stop?

361
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,047
I don't know.

362
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,014
Like a park bench?

363
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,247
I have no idea.

364
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,680
Who puts a bench in the house?

365
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:38,580
Forget the bench!

366
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,229
I got it.

367
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:40,414
I got it.

368
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,847
You want to get her
something nice?

369
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,847
What about a music box?

370
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,047
Nah, too relationship-y.

371
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,914
She opens it up, she hears
that "Lara's Theme," I'm dead.

372
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,880
Okay, what about a nice frame

373
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,580
with a picture
of another guy in it?

374
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,447
The frame says "I care for you,
but if you want to get serious,

375
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,080
perhaps you'd be interested
in someone like this."

376
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,080
Nice-looking fella.

377
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,380
What about candle holders?

378
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:08,547
Too romantic.

379
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,714
Lingerie?

380
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:10,229
Too sexual.

381
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:10,747
Too sexual.

382
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,880
Waffle maker?

383
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,047
Too domestic.

384
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,547
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?

385
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,047
Too... gubernatorial.

386
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:25,247
Let's work on the card.

387
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,247
I had to buy a gift for someone.

388
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,880
The hardest part, to me,
is that card.

389
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,047
That card is the killer.

390
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,914
I never know
what it's supposed to say,

391
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,680
and it's getting so tough

392
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,547
because the relationships
are becoming so complicated,

393
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,347
greeting card companies
now put out cards

394
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,228
that are blank on the inside.

395
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:40,547
that are blank on the inside.

396
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,114
Nothing. No message.

397
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,947
I mean, it's like
the card company says,

398
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,247
"We give up. You think
of something," you know?

399
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,114
"For 75 cents,
I don't want to get involved."

400
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:52,747
Maybe you won't like it.

401
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,180
Oh, how could I not like it?

402
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,214
Of course I'll like it.

403
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,280
You could not like it.

404
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:58,547
Just the fact
that you remembered

405
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,114
means everything.

406
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:01,947
Of course I remembered.

407
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,680
You reminded me every day
for two months.

408
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:07,047
Oh, the card.

409
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,847
Cash?

410
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,080
What do you think?

411
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,680
You got me cash?

412
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:30,514
Well, this way,
I figure you could go out

413
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,047
and get yourself
whatever you want.

414
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,180
No good?

415
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:36,347
Who are you, my uncle?

416
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,880
Hey, come on, that's $182 there.

417
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,594
I don't think that's
anything to sneeze at.

418
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,914
Let me see the card.

419
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,280
"To a wonderful girl,

420
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:58,247
a great pal, and more?"

421
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,614
Hey.

422
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,280
Oh, Elaine,
I'm glad you're here.

423
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:06,547
Stay... stay
right here.

424
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,714
I'm gonna be
right back. Stay.

425
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,228
Pal? You think I'm your pal?

426
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,714
Pal? You think I'm your pal?

427
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,814
I said, "And more."

428
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,614
I am not your pal.

429
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,180
What's wrong with pal?

430
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,214
Why is everybody so down on pal?

431
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,947
Here.

432
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,414
Oh, what is this?

433
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,714
You got me something?

434
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,047
Yeah. Yeah. Open it.

435
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,647
Oh, Kramer!

436
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,780
Oh! The bench!

437
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,914
You got me the bench
that I wanted!

438
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,380
That's pretty good, huh?
Great.

439
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,380
Remember when we were standing
there, and she mentioned it?

440
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,747
I made a mental note of it.

441
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,547
Well, goodie for you.

442
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,447
Oh, yeah. See,
I'm very sensitive about that.

443
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,047
I mean, someone's birthday
comes up,

444
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,247
I keep my ears open.

445
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,414
So, what did you get her?

446
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,847
182 bucks.

447
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,714
Cash?

448
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,547
You gotta be kidding.
What kind of gift is that?

449
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,229
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

450
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,070
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

451
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:18,614
Think where man's glory
most begins and ends,

452
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:22,580
and say my glory was
I had such a friend.

453
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,480
Yeats.

454
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:29,380
Oh, Kramer...

455
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:30,747
Yeah...

456
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,580
Could you excuse us, please?

457
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,580
Well, what?

458
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,880
We're talking.

459
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,228
Oh, the relationship.

460
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,047
Oh, the relationship.

461
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,447
You know, we never had one fight

462
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,447
before this deal.

463
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,547
I know.

464
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,680
Never.
Ever.

465
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,380
We got along beautifully.

466
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:58,547
Like clams.

467
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
It was wonderful.

468
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,247
A pleasure.

469
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,414
So I think we should just
forget the whole deal

470
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,880
and go back to being friends.

471
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:10,229
I can't do it.

472
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:10,847
I can't do it.

473
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,747
You what?

474
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,880
I can't do that.

475
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:19,947
You mean, it's...

476
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,580
No this?

477
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:25,747
No that?

478
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:34,714
No this or that.
Oh, boy.

479
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,547
Hmm.

480
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,380
What do you want?

481
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:40,228
This, that, and the other.

482
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:41,880
This, that, and the other.

483
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,780
Oh, sure, of course.
You're entitled.

484
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:46,880
Who doesn't want this,
that, and the other?

485
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:49,547
You.

486
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,480
Well...

487
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,514
Oh, those birthdays.

488
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:58,847
I told you,
they're relationship killers.

489
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,547
If a relationship is having
any problems whatsoever,

490
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,247
a birthday will always
bring it out.

491
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,414
I never should've made up
those rules.

492
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:09,714
What is it about sex
that just disrupts everything?

493
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:10,229
Is it the touching,
is it the nudity?

494
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,280
Is it the touching,
is it the nudity?

495
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:14,180
It can't be the nudity.

496
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,014
I never got into these
terrible kind of fights

497
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,347
and misunderstandings

498
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,247
when I was changing
before gym class.

499
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,714
You know what this means?
I can't see her anymore, either.

500
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:24,780
Why?

501
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:29,747
It's breakup by association.

502
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,847
Besides, she's mad at me anyway
because of my birthday present.

503
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,214
What? What did you wind up
giving her?

504
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:38,747
$91.

505
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:43,547
Sorry about that.

506
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,714
So, what are you gonna do?

507
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:48,447
Well, if I do call her,

508
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,114
there's no joking around
anymore.

509
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,214
This is pretty much it.

510
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,680
So maybe this should be it.

511
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,180
It could be it.

512
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,080
She seems like an it.

513
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:59,847
She's as it as you get.

514
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Imagine bumping into her
on the street in five years

515
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:03,880
with a husband?

516
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,547
And she tells me
that he's a sculptor,

517
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,747
they live in Vermont.

518
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:09,114
We'd have to kill him.

519
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:10,228
We'd get caught.
I'd get the chair.

520
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,847
We'd get caught.
I'd get the chair.

521
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,680
I'd go to prison
as your accomplice.

522
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:19,047
Have to wear
that really heavy denim.

523
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,447
Go to the cafeteria line,

524
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,914
with the guy who slops those
mashed potatoes onto your plate.

525
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:27,047
Go to the bathroom
in front of hundreds of people.

526
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
Plus, you know what else.

527
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,280
You better call her.

528
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:37,214
Hey.
Hey.

529
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,214
You got the paper yet?

530
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,680
Yeah.

531
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:40,229
Well, where is it?

532
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,314
Well, where is it?

533
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,547
Hey, are you done with that?

534
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,747
No.

535
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,060
Well, you're not reading it now.

536
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,047
All right, you can take it,

537
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,180
but I want it back.

538
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:52,614
Oh, yeah.

539
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,714
So, uh, what are you guys
gonna do today?

540
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:02,214
Oh, this and...

541
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:03,280
that.

542
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,880
And the other.

543
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:09,080
Boy, I really liked
the two of you much better

544
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,228
when you weren't a couple.

545
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,047
when you weren't a couple.

546
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:25,914
Why is commitment
such a big problem for a man?

547
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:27,680
I think that for some reason,

548
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:31,747
when a man is driving
down that freeway of life,

549
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,714
the woman's he's involved with
is like an exit,

550
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:37,547
but he doesn't want to get out.
He wants to keep driving,

551
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,847
and the woman is like, "Look,
gas, food, lodging.

552
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,014
"That's our exit.

553
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:42,947
"That's everything we need
to be happy.

554
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,947
Get out of here now!"

555
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,780
But the man is focusing
on the sign underneath

556
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,080
that says,
"Next exit... 27 miles,"

557
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:50,114
that says,
"Next exit... 27 miles,"

558
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:51,814
and he thinks, "I can make it."
