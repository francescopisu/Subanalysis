1
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:04,607
I'm always in traffic
with the lane expert.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,874
You know this type of person?

3
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:09,940
Constantly re-evaluating
their lane choice.

4
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:11,440
Never quite sure.

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,074
"Is this the best lane for me
for my life?"

6
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:16,340
They're always
a little bit ahead of you.

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:17,674
"Can I get in over there?"

8
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:19,907
"Could I get ahead of you?
Could I get in there?"

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,907
"Yeah, come on over here, pal.
We're zooming over here.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,707
This is the secret lane.
Nobody knows about it."

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,074
The ultimate...

12
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:28,574
I think the ultimate
psychological test of traffic

13
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,874
is the total dead stop.

14
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:30,000
Not even rolling,

15
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,440
Not even rolling,

16
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:33,707
and you look out the window,
you can see gum clearly.

17
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:36,574
But we know that in the future,

18
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,607
traffic will get
even worse than that.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,674
I mean, what will happen?

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,907
Will it start moving backwards,
I wonder?

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,907
Is that possible?

22
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,207
That someday, we'll be going,

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,240
"Boy, this is some
really bad traffic now, boy.

24
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:51,540
"This... is really bad.

25
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,774
"I'm going to try and get off

26
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,607
and get back on,
going the other way."

27
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:02,340
She can't kill me, right?

28
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:03,840
No, of course not.

29
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:05,540
People break up all the time.
Every day.

30
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:06,740
It just didn't work out.

31
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:07,907
What can I do?

32
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,907
I wanted to love her.
I tried to love her.

33
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,907
I couldn't.

34
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,074
You tried.

35
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,340
I'd be looking at her face,

36
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,240
I'd go, "Come on.
Love her, love her."

37
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,514
Did you tell her you loved her?

38
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,507
Oh, I had no choice.

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,774
She squeezed it out of me.

40
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,907
She'd tell me
she loved me, all right?

41
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,740
So, at first,
I'd just look at her.

42
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:27,682
I'd go, "Oh, really?"

43
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:27,874
I'd go, "Oh, really?"

44
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:30,840
Or "boy, that's...
that's something,"

45
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:33,240
but eventually,
you have to come back

46
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:35,574
with, "well, I love you."

47
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,340
You can only hold out
for so long.

48
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,040
You're a human being.

49
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:41,040
I didn't ask even her out.
She asked me out first.

50
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,274
She called me up.

51
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,507
What was I supposed to do,
say no?

52
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,507
I can't.

53
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,107
You're too nice a guy.

54
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,607
I am.
I'm a nice guy.

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,207
And then she seduced me.

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,107
We're in my apartment,

57
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm sitting on the couch,
she's on the chair.

58
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,574
I get up to go to the bathroom,

59
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:57,682
I come back, she's on the couch!

60
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,374
I come back, she's on the couch!

61
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:01,007
What am I supposed to do,
not do anything?

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,074
I couldn't do that.

63
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,174
That would have insulted her.

64
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,207
You're flesh and blood.

65
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,940
I had nothing to do
with any of this.

66
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:08,507
I met all her friends.

67
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,007
I didn't want to meet them.

68
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,240
I kept trying to avoid it.

69
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,107
I knew it would only
get me in deeper,

70
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,274
but they were everywhere.

71
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,207
The kept popping up
all over the place.

72
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,374
"This is Nancy. This is Susan.
This is Amy.

73
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,874
"This is my cousin.
This is my brother.

74
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:20,874
This is my father."

75
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,874
I'm in quicksand here.

76
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,374
I told you when I met her.

77
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,674
My back is killing me.

78
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,074
You gotta go to my chiropractor.

79
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:27,683
He's the best.

80
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:28,340
He's the best.

81
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:30,174
Oh, everybody's guy is the best.

82
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:31,407
I'm gonna make
an appointment for you.

83
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,707
We'll go together.

84
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,907
Please.
They don't do anything.

85
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,074
Look, do I have to
break up with her in person?

86
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,674
Can't I do it over the phone?

87
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:40,207
I have no stomach
for these things.

88
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,007
You should just do it
like a Band-aid...

89
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,907
one motion... right off!

90
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Hi!

91
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:47,407
Hi.

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,007
What are you doing?

93
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,740
I'm letting you in.

94
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,507
Oh, no, I don't want
to sit in back.

95
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,740
I'll be left out
of the conversation.

96
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,740
No, you won't.

97
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,107
Yes, I will, George.

98
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,682
I'll have to stick my chin
on top of the seat.

99
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,274
I'll have to stick my chin
on top of the seat.

100
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,540
Okay.

101
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:00,774
Why can't you sit in the middle?

102
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,040
Please.

103
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,340
It doesn't look good...
boy, boy, girl.

104
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:07,440
Ah, I think you're afraid
to sit next to a man.

105
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:08,994
You're a little
homophobic, aren't you?

106
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,107
Is it that obvious?

107
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,507
Hello, Jerry.

108
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,507
Hello.

109
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,907
Did you get a haircut?

110
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,407
Nope. Shower.

111
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,507
So, where are we eating?

112
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Tell me if you think
this is strange.

113
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:24,540
There's this guy
who lives in my building

114
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,774
who I was introduced to
a couple years ago by a friend.

115
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,683
He's a, uh, teacher
or something.

116
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:28,940
He's a, uh, teacher
or something.

117
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:31,440
Anyway, after we met, whenever
we'd run into each other

118
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,840
In the street, or in the lobby,
or whatever,

119
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,040
we would stop
and we would chat a little bit.

120
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,240
Nothing much, you know,
pleasantries.

121
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,207
He's a nice guy,
he's got a family.

122
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,874
Then after a while,

123
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:43,040
I noticed
there was no more stopping,

124
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,207
just sort of saying hello
and continuing on our way.

125
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,340
And then
the verbal hellos stopped,

126
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,507
and we just went into

127
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,607
these little sort of nods
of recognition.

128
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,874
So fine.

129
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:55,174
I figure that's where
this relationship

130
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,682
is finally going to settle...
polite nodding.

131
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:58,174
is finally going to settle...
polite nodding.

132
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:01,574
Then one day, he doesn't nod.

133
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,674
Hmm.

134
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:04,507
Like I don't exist.

135
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,274
He went from nods to nothing.

136
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:08,674
♪ You know I'd go
From nods to nothing ♪

137
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,540
And now there's
this intense animosity

138
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,107
whenever we pass.

139
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,740
I mean, it's like
we really hate each other.

140
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,774
It's based on nothing.

141
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,874
A relationship is an organism.

142
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,407
You created this thing,
and then you starved it,

143
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,107
so it turned against you.

144
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,340
Same thing happened in <i>The Blob.</i>

145
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:26,174
I think you absolutely

146
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,407
have to say something
to this guy.

147
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,683
Confront him.

148
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:28,407
Confront him.

149
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,407
Really?
Yes!

150
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,407
Would you do that?

151
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,540
If I was a different person.

152
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,607
Hello?

153
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Hello. Is Glen there?

154
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:42,440
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this 805-555-3234?

155
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:43,940
Yes, I know
I have the wrong number,

156
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:48,407
but I just want to know
if I dialed wrong or...

157
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,707
Why do people do that?

158
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:57,682
Come on up.

159
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,274
Come on up.

160
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:00,707
Oh, it's you again.

161
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,040
See, now,
if you had answered me,

162
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,774
I wouldn't have had to do this.

163
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:04,774
Now, that's two
long distance calls

164
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,040
I've made to you.

165
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,574
Why can't you...?

166
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,274
Why? Why do they
just hang up like that?

167
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,307
Thank you very much.

168
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,874
Taste this.

169
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,507
No, I just had a sandwich.

170
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,507
No, taste it.
Taste it.

171
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,840
I don't want cantaloupe.

172
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:21,907
You never had
cantaloupe like this.

173
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
I only eat cantaloupe
at certain times...

174
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,774
But, Jerry, this
is great cantaloupe.

175
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,574
All right!

176
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:29,940
There. Huh?

177
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,374
It's very good.
It's good, huh?

178
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,607
It's good.

179
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,674
I got it at Joe's.
Uh-huh.

180
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:35,107
49 cents a pound.
Mm.

181
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,040
That's practically half
of what you're paying

182
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,407
at the supermarket.

183
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,107
I don't know why
you don't go to Joe's.

184
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,707
It's too far.

185
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,207
It's three blocks further.

186
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,407
You can use my shopping cart.

187
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,507
I'm not pulling a shopping cart.

188
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,707
Should I wear a kerchief,
put stockings on,

189
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,274
and roll 'em down below my knee?

190
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:56,274
See, the other thing is,
if you don't like anything,

191
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,340
he takes it right back.

192
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:57,683
I don't return fruit.

193
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,007
I don't return fruit.

194
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
Fruit's a gamble.

195
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,640
I know that going in.

196
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,840
♪ Ye-di-di-di-di-di-di... ♪

197
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,174
I'm out of there!
I did it! It's over!

198
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,340
You did it?
What happened?

199
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,740
I told her, in the kitchen,
which was risky,

200
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,054
because it's near
all the knives.

201
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:21,940
I started
with the word "listen."

202
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,274
Uh-huh.

203
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,507
I said, "Listen, Marlene..."

204
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,507
Next thing I know,
I'm in the middle of it,

205
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,683
and there's this voice
inside of me going,

206
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,040
and there's this voice
inside of me going,

207
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,674
"You're doing it...
you're doing it!"

208
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:34,174
And then she started to cry,
and I weakened a little bit.

209
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,440
I almost relented,

210
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,374
but the voice, Jerry, the voice
said, "Keep going.

211
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,374
Keep going. You're almost out."

212
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,540
It's... it's like
I was making a prison break.

213
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,040
You know,
and I'm heading for the wall,

214
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,774
and I trip and I twist my ankle,

215
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:48,040
and they throw
that light on you, you know?

216
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,840
Somehow,
I get through the crying,

217
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,574
and I keep running.

218
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,607
Then the cursing started.

219
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,907
She's firing from guard towers.

220
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,682
"Son of a... " Bang!
"Son of a... " Boom!

221
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,740
"Son of a... " Bang!
"Son of a... " Boom!

222
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:01,274
I get to the top of the wall,
the front door,

223
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,940
I open it up, I'm one foot away,

224
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,240
I take one last look
around the penitentiary,

225
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,707
and I jump!

226
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,274
See?
Never as bad as you imagine.

227
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:10,874
I like that Marlene.

228
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,507
What's her number?

229
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,040
Uh... yeah.
No, I... I don't think so.

230
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,740
Could you stop that smacking?

231
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,874
George, I want you
to taste this cantaloupe.

232
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,207
Oh, no, thank you.

233
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,507
It's the best cantaloupe
I ever had.

234
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,107
No, really. No. No, thanks.

235
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,683
Jerry, tell him
how good this cantaloupe is.

236
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:28,607
Jerry, tell him
how good this cantaloupe is.

237
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,607
Very good cantaloupe.

238
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,374
Du... oh!

239
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,440
So that's it?
Yeah.

240
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:35,540
You're out.

241
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,607
Except for one small problem.

242
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,774
I, um...

243
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,540
I... I left some books
in her apartment.

244
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:45,907
So? Go get them.

245
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,240
Oh, no, no.
I can't go back there.

246
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:49,740
Jerry, it's so awkward,
and, you know,

247
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,574
it could be dangerous...
sexually.

248
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,074
Something could happen.

249
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,374
I'd be right back
where I started from.

250
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,207
So forget about the books.

251
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,682
Did you read them?

252
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:57,907
Did you read them?

253
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,507
Well, yeah.

254
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,774
What do you need 'em for?

255
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:03,874
I don't know. They're books.

256
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:06,740
What is this obsession
people have with books?

257
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,340
They put them in their houses
like they're trophies.

258
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,674
What do you need it for
after you read it?

259
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,574
They're my books.

260
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,940
So you want me to get the books,
is that it?

261
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,240
So it must have been

262
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:22,574
95 degrees that night,

263
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,607
and everyone's just standing
around the pool,

264
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,507
with little drinks
in their hands.

265
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,682
I was wearing my old jeans
and t-shirt.

266
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,707
I was wearing my old jeans
and t-shirt.

267
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,940
I don't know.

268
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,907
I was just in
one of those moods,

269
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,940
so I said to myself,
"Marlene, just do it,"

270
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,507
and I jumped in.

271
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,340
And as I'm getting out,
I feel all these eyes on me.

272
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:42,607
So, I look up

273
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,607
and everyone
is just staring at me.

274
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,740
So what did you do?

275
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,040
Well, nothing.

276
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,407
It's no skin off my hide
if people like to look.

277
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,907
I just didn't see
what the big attraction was.

278
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,374
Well, I have a general idea
what it was.

279
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:57,683
I could take a guess.

280
00:08:57,684 --> 00:08:59,440
I could take a guess.

281
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,340
Hey, you know, Jerry,

282
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,607
just because George and I
don't see each other anymore,

283
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,707
it doesn't mean
we shouldn't stay friends.

284
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:10,674
No.

285
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:11,740
Good enough.

286
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,874
I'm really glad
we got that settled.

287
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,374
Great.

288
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,540
I don't know how this happened.

289
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:23,607
Jerry, it's not my fault.

290
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,774
No, no, it's not your fault.

291
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,682
"Books, books,
I need my books."

292
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:28,923
"Books, books,
I need my books."

293
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:34,240
Have you re-read those books
yet, by the way?

294
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,874
You know the great thing?

295
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,374
When you read <i>Moby Dick</i>
the second time,

296
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,107
Ahab and the whale
become good friends.

297
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:43,240
You know, it's not like

298
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:44,774
Marlene's a bad person
or anything,

299
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,274
but, my God!

300
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,674
I mean, we've had, like,
three lunches and a movie,

301
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,174
and she never stops calling.

302
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,540
And it's those
meaningless, purposeless

303
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:54,540
blather calls.

304
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,540
She never asks
if I'm busy or anything.

305
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,682
I just pick up the phone,

306
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:57,940
I just pick up the phone,

307
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,440
and she's in the middle
of a sentence.

308
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,774
It's... it's standard.

309
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,607
Has she left you
one of those messages

310
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,707
Which uses up the whole machine?

311
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, and you know,
sometimes she'll go,

312
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,107
"Hello, Jerry?"

313
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,607
And I'll go,

314
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,774
"Oh, hi, Marlene."

315
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,507
And then it's, "Jerry...

316
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,007
I don't know sometimes."
"I don't know sometimes."

317
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,374
What about trying
to get off the phone?

318
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:23,774
Oh!

319
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:26,007
You can't!
It's impossible.

320
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,682
There's no break
in the conversation

321
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:28,507
There's no break
in the conversation

322
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,774
where you can go,
"all right, then..."

323
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,607
You know, it just
goes on and on and on

324
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,007
without a break in the wall.

325
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,574
I mean, I've got
to put a stop this.

326
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:39,374
Do it like a Band-aid.

327
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,540
One motion... right off!

328
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,607
She is sexy, though,
don't you think?

329
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,674
Yeah.

330
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,440
Yeah, she is.

331
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:51,874
Mr. Costanza?

332
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:53,107
Yeah?

333
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,774
The doctor will see you.

334
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:57,307
Yeah. "Doctor."

335
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,374
I'm gonna have to wait

336
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:03,707
in that little room
all by myself,

337
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,274
aren't I?

338
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,407
I better take this.

339
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,340
I hate the little room.

340
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:13,507
Oh, hello, "doctor."

341
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,007
The waiting room,

342
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,374
I hate when they make you
wait in the room.

343
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:19,074
It says "waiting room."

344
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:20,387
There's no chance
of not waiting.

345
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:23,507
Since they call it
"the waiting room,"

346
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,507
they're gonna use it.

347
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,507
They've got it.

348
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,607
It's all set up for you to wait.

349
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,683
And you sit there, you know,

350
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:28,907
And you sit there, you know,

351
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,174
and you got
your little magazine.

352
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:31,540
You pretend you're reading it,

353
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,374
but you're really
looking at the other people.

354
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:37,107
You know
you're thinking about them.

355
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,807
Things like,
"I wonder what he's got."

356
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,207
"As soon as she goes,
I'm getting her magazine."

357
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:52,007
And then they finally call you,
and it's a very exciting moment.

358
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,740
They finally call you,
and you stand up,

359
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,274
and you kind of look around
at the other people in the room,

360
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:57,682
"Well...
I guess I've been chosen.

361
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,540
"Well...
I guess I've been chosen.

362
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,340
I'll see you all later."

363
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:06,740
You know, and so you think
you're going to see the doctor,

364
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,007
but you're not, are you? No.

365
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,740
You're going into
the next waiting room...

366
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,640
the littler waiting room.

367
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,074
But if they are, you know,

368
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,174
doing some sort of medical thing
to you,

369
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,507
You want to be

370
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,040
in the smallest room
that they have.

371
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,740
You don't want to be
in the largest room

372
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,507
that they have,
you know what I mean?

373
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,374
You ever see
these operating theaters

374
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:27,683
with, like, stadium seating?

375
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:29,540
with, like, stadium seating?

376
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,707
You don't want them
doing anything to you

377
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,074
that makes other doctors go,
"I have to see this."

378
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,240
"Are you kidding?

379
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:38,040
"Are they gonna really
do that to him?

380
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:41,207
"Are there seats? Can we get in?

381
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Do they scalp tickets
to these things?

382
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,507
"I got two
for the Winslow tumor.

383
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,640
I got two."

384
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,707
So, how was it?

385
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,207
I was in there for two minutes.

386
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,682
He didn't do anything.

387
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:57,707
He didn't do anything.

388
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,640
Touch this, feel that...
75 bucks.

389
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,507
Well, it's a first visit.

390
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,407
It's 75 bucks.

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,207
What, am I seeing Sinatra
in there?

392
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:12,240
Am I being entertained?
I don't understand this.

393
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,774
I'm only paying half.

394
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,707
You can't do that.

395
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,874
Why not?

396
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,874
He's a doctor.
You got to pay what he says.

397
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:19,874
Oh, no, no, no.

398
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,707
I pay what I say.

399
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:27,683
You feeling weird?

400
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,174
You feeling weird?

401
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,107
No.

402
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,574
I'm fine.

403
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,607
Nothing really happened.

404
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,107
Yeah.

405
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,240
I know.

406
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:41,074
We just kissed a little.

407
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,607
People kiss.

408
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,774
Yeah.

409
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:51,540
Well...

410
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,374
Night.

411
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,107
Good night.

412
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,107
Hey.

413
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,374
Hey.

414
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,374
I got it.
This time I got it.

415
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,374
All right.

416
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:18,740
Hips! See?

417
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,440
It's all in the hips.
All right.

418
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:22,540
Come through
with the hips first.

419
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,340
Whoosh!

420
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:28,907
That is out there.

421
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,740
Definitely.

422
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:31,907
Joe's?

423
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,207
No. Supermarket.

424
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,407
Well, is it good?

425
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
It's, uh, it's okay.

426
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:38,513
Well, let me taste it.

427
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:40,240
Well, let me taste it.

428
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:41,640
Oh. See? That stinks.

429
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,007
You can't eat that.

430
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,240
You should take that back.
I'm not taking it back.

431
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:50,007
All right. I'll take it back.
I'm going by there.

432
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,007
I don't care about it.

433
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,007
Jerry, you should care.

434
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Cantaloupe like this

435
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,407
should be taken
out of circulation.

436
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,274
All right. Take it back.

437
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,907
No. No...

438
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,574
<i>Leave a message.
I'll call you back.</i>

439
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,474
<i>Jerry, have you ever
taken a bath in the dark?</i>

440
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,240
<i>I'm not talking into the soap
right now.</i>

441
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,074
<i>Call me back.</i>

442
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,407
Who was that?

443
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,607
Marlene.

444
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,907
Mar...

445
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,240
Oh... Oh.

446
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,707
Marlene.

447
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,074
I took her home one night

448
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:25,340
and we kind of started up
a little bit in the car.

449
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,340
I thought you were
trying to get rid of her.

450
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:30,540
I was, but she's got me,
like, hypnotized or something.

451
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:31,574
Does George know?

452
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:32,607
No. He'd go nuts.

453
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,007
Yeah, no kidding.

454
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,607
I feel terrible.

455
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,340
I mean, I've seen her
a couple of times since then,

456
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,874
and I know
I can't go any further,

457
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,607
but I... I...

458
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,840
she's got this psychosexual
hold over me.

459
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,040
I just want her.

460
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,174
I can't breathe.
It's like a drug.

461
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,874
Psychosexual.

462
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,274
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell him.

463
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:06,240
Man, I don't understand people.

464
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,513
I mean, why would George want
to deprive you of pleasure?

465
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,674
I mean, why would George want
to deprive you of pleasure?

466
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:10,940
Is it just me?

467
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:13,140
It's partially you, yeah.

468
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,107
You're his friend.

469
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,240
I mean, better that she should
sleep with someone else?

470
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,407
Some jerk that he doesn't know?

471
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,674
Well, he can't kill me, right?

472
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,107
You're a human being.

473
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,574
I mean, and she called me.

474
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,040
I never called her.
She started it!

475
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,040
You're flesh and blood.

476
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:28,907
I'm a nice guy!

477
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,407
Yeah.

478
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,407
Hi.

479
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,540
Hi.
Hi.

480
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,507
Ah, my little airplane lamp.

481
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,107
Mm.

482
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,513
You have the slowest elevator
in the entire city.

483
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,507
You have the slowest elevator
in the entire city.

484
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,007
That's hard to get used to

485
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,674
when you're in so many
other fast ones.

486
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:44,940
Well, the apartment elevators
are always slower than offices

487
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,907
because you don't have
to be home on time.

488
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,074
Unless you're married
to a dictator.

489
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah.

490
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:53,540
Because they'd be
very demanding people.

491
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:56,707
That's right.
Exactly.

492
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,707
So, I imagine, at some point,

493
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,074
somebody's gonna offer me
some cantaloupe?

494
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:01,874
No. No good.

495
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,274
Well, you know what they say.

496
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:06,940
Lucky in love,
unlucky with fruit.

497
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,513
Well, I'm taking this back.

498
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:09,594
Well, I'm taking this back.

499
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,240
So, I had what you might call

500
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:18,274
a little encounter this morning.

501
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,274
Really? That guy
who stopped saying hello?

502
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,007
Yeah.
You talk to him?

503
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,507
Yeah, I spotted him
getting his mail,

504
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,740
and, at first, I was
just going to walk on by.

505
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,540
But then I thought,
"No, no, no, no.

506
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:28,774
Do not be afraid of this man."

507
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,774
Right.

508
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,740
So I walked up behind him

509
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:35,340
and tapped him on the shoulder,
and said, "Hi. Remember me?"

510
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,407
And he furrows his brow,

511
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,513
as if he's really
trying to figure it out.

512
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,207
as if he's really
trying to figure it out.

513
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,374
So I said to him,

514
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:45,407
I said, "You little phony.
You know exactly who I am."

515
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
You said "you little phony"?

516
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,240
I did.
I most certainly did.

517
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:54,040
And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah,
you're Jeanette's friend.

518
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,907
We did meet once."

519
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,907
And I said, "Well, how do you go
from that

520
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,007
to ignoring a person
when they walk by?"

521
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,207
This is amazing.

522
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,440
And he says... he says,

523
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:06,240
"Look, I just didn't want to say
hello anymore, all right?"

524
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,513
And I said, "Fine! Fine!

525
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:08,940
And I said, "Fine! Fine!

526
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,107
"I didn't want to say hello
anymore either,

527
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,640
but I wanted you to know
that I'm aware of it."

528
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:19,440
You are
the queen of confrontation.

529
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,674
You're my new hero.

530
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,907
In fact, you've inspired me.

531
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,007
I'm going to call George
about something right now.

532
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh...

533
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,274
This cantaloupe stinks.

534
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,207
I don't care.

535
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,514
You're kidding?

536
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,540
You're kidding?

537
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:40,607
No. I don't care.

538
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,607
You mean that?

539
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,607
Absolutely.

540
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,374
You don't care?
No.

541
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,440
How could you not care?

542
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,874
I don't know, but I don't.

543
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,507
I'm actually
almost happy to hear it.

544
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,940
I thought you'd be upset.

545
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,540
Well, I guess I should be,
but I'm not.

546
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,040
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?

547
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,107
You're a fine person.

548
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,540
You're a humanitarian.

549
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,440
She's very sexy.

550
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,674
That voice, that voice.
She's driving me crazy.

551
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,240
I know. I know.

552
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,374
So I can see her tonight
and you don't care?

553
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,513
See her tonight,
see her tomorrow. Go.

554
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,174
See her tonight,
see her tomorrow. Go.

555
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,607
Knock yourself out.

556
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,507
She's too crazy for me.

557
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,740
All right, as long
as you're okay.

558
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,240
Because I can't stop
thinking about her.

559
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,840
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm wonderful.

560
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,007
I never felt better
in my whole life.

561
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,240
Good.

562
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,840
And I'll tell you what.

563
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,840
You don't have
to pay me back the $35

564
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,907
I gave the chiropractor
for the rest of your bill.

565
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,507
You paid that crook?

566
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,107
I had to.

567
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,040
He didn't do anything!
Jerry, it's a scam!

568
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,540
Who told you to do that?

569
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,740
It was embarrassing to me.

570
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,507
Oh, I trying to make a point.

571
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,240
Why don't you make a point
with your own doctor?

572
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:41,274
Yeah, but J...

573
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:43,340
What's wrong?

574
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:45,674
I think I swallowed a fly.

575
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,040
Oh, God.

576
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,574
I swallowed a fly!

577
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,707
What do I do? What can happen?

578
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,374
So, you want to come up
for a few minutes?

579
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm sorry, Jerry.

580
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,340
I just don't think
this is gonna work.

581
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,207
Really?

582
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,340
I thought...

583
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:08,514
I know.

584
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:09,340
I know.

585
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,074
I'm sorry.

586
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,074
Gee... I just
didn't expect it

587
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,740
from the way you've been acting.

588
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,240
Are you sure you want
to talk about this?

589
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,740
Because I sure don't.

590
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,607
Of course I want
to talk about it.

591
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,340
Well, okay.

592
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:25,574
I guess things changed for me

593
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,207
on Tuesday night.

594
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,574
Tuesday night?

595
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,074
What happened Tuesday night?

596
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:33,207
I saw your act.

597
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,074
My act?

598
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:38,513
What does that
have to do with anything?

599
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:39,040
What does that
have to do with anything?

600
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:44,407
Well, to be honest,
it just didn't make it for me.

601
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,274
It's just so much fluff.

602
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,507
I can't believe this.

603
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,174
So what are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

604
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,174
So that's it?

605
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,374
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

606
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,274
You're a cashier.

607
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,040
Look, Jerry,
it wasn't my kind of humor.

608
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:07,440
You can't go by the audience
that night.

609
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,513
It was late.
They were terrible.

610
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:09,040
It was late.
They were terrible.

611
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:11,374
I heard the material.

612
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,040
I have other stuff.

613
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:18,340
You should come see me
on the weekend.

614
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:24,207
Women need to like the job
of the guy they're with.

615
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,340
If they don't like the job,
they don't like the guy.

616
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:28,674
Men know this.

617
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:31,040
Which is why we make up

618
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:35,040
the phony, bogus names
for the jobs that we have.

619
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,207
"Right now,

620
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,440
"I'm the regional
management supervisor.

621
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:38,514
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

622
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

623
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,374
Men, on the other hand,

624
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:46,374
if they are physically attracted
to a woman,

625
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,740
are not that concerned
with her job, are we?

626
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:51,174
Men don't really care.

627
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,340
Men will just go,

628
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,607
"Really? Slaughterhouse?
Is that where you work?

629
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,907
"That sounds interesting.

630
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,740
"So, what,
you got a big cleaver there?

631
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,740
"You just
lopping their heads off?

632
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,740
"That sounds great.

633
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:01,774
"Listen,
why don't you shower up,

634
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,140
and we'll get some burgers
and catch a movie?"
