1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,549
I never really understood...

2
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:06,715
...the importance of the conductor.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,493
Between you and me,
what the hell is this guy doing?

4
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:14,434
Do you really need somebody
waving a stick in your face...

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,629
...to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?

6
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,931
I could see how we need him
at the beginning, okay?

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,532
Tap, tap, tap.

8
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:25,691
''Start.'' Okay.
I could see how you need that.

9
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:29,026
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening...

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,849
...what do we need him for then?

11
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:35,872
I don't see the cellist looking up, ''I’m
confused. I don't know what to do.''

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,910
Then the conductor go,
''Do this. Like this....''

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,666
''Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much.''

14
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,714
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.

15
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,850
I’ll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.

16
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:53,125
-Oh, yes, you will.
-No, I won't.

17
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,625
Yeah, maybe you won't.

18
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,714
It's hard enough to meet a woman
you dislike, much less like.

19
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:03,716
-Are my nostrils getting bigger?
-No.

20
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:07,815
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?

21
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:11,945
Why can't I just walk up to a woman
and say, ''Hi, I’m George''?

22
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,022
''How are you?'' Is that so terrible?

23
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,141
H-- H-- Hi.

24
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:18,480
Hi. Hi.

25
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:23,601
-There's no men out there.
-I know.

26
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:27,506
The problem is that the good ones
know they're good.

27
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:28,945
They know they're in demand....

28
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:32,207
They're not interested in confining
themselves to one person.

29
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,610
I hate the good ones.

30
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:35,951
Is Jerry a good one?

31
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,021
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.

32
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,257
The mediocre ones are available...

33
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:44,311
...but so insecure not being
a good one...

34
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,512
...they're always,
''I’m not good enough for you.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,122
What are you doing with me?''
Eventually I just go, ''You're right.''

36
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,602
Maybe you need somebody
between good and mediocre.

37
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,593
No, maybe I need somebody
who has nothing.

38
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:01,650
Somebody who just appreciates being
with me because he's so desperate.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,505
It’s gotten to the point where I’m
flirting with operators on the phone.

40
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,346
I almost made a date with one.

41
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, so there's still hope.

42
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,437
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me.

43
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,469
My dream is to become hopeless.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,818
The hopeless don't care.

45
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,668
When you don't care,
that indifference makes you attractive.

46
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,607
-So hopelessness is the key.
-It’s my only hope.

47
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,424
You see, I wouldn't really mind
so much...

48
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,147
...but I feel badly for my mother.

49
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,737
lf my mother weren't around,
it wouldn't be so bad.

50
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:39,837
But, I’m telling you, if I’m not married
by the time I’m 40, I’ll have to kill her.

51
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:43,103
Because it's the only fair thing to do.

52
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,634
I just couldn't put her through that.

53
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:48,640
At least you're not bitter.

54
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,269
Who says I’m not bitter?

55
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,497
-Aren't you too young to be bitter?
-No, you can be young and bitter.

56
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,720
Just maybe not as bitter as I’ll be
1 0 years from now.

57
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,934
But I’m bitter.

58
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:03,973
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,033
Don't worry. Your bitterness
is safe with me.

60
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,458
Okay. Order me a piece of cake.

61
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:13,510
I’m gonna go throw up.

62
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,319
Look at my hands.

63
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:22,892
Look.

64
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:25,068
Filthy from the paper.

65
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:29,263
They should give you a Wet-Nap when
you buy one, like at those rib joints.

66
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:33,033
-What did you do last night?
-Went out with George. You?

67
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,827
Went out with Cynthia.

68
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,363
What did you talk about?

69
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,555
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.

70
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,194
Cynthia felt we should nuke
the rain forest.

71
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:48,364
Get rid of it in one fell swoop
so we could eliminate it...

72
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,420
...as a subject of conversation.

73
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,095
-What about you?
-We brushed on that.

74
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,025
Actually, George was in rare form.

75
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:01,493
He just can't find anybody.

76
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,182
I know. Cynthia too.

77
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,741
-She's really given up.
-George too.

78
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,305
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, right.

79
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:18,649
-I’ve never fixed anybody up.
-Ugh! Me neither

80
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:22,194
And I am not about to
start with George.

81
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,189
Well, why wouldn't you start
with George?

82
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:28,884
You think she's too good for George?

83
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,938
I didn't say ''too good,'' did l?

84
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:33,241
-You implied it.
-I didn't say it.

85
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,196
lf you think she's too good
for George...

86
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,229
...you are dead wrong. Dead wrong.

87
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,015
Who is she?

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,517
-Who is he?
-He's George.

89
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,239
-She's Cynthia.
-So what?

90
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,470
What, you don't think
she's beautiful?

91
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,775
What's with the eyebrows?

92
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:56,802
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.

93
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,491
I went out with you.

94
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:05,981
That's because my standards
are too low.

95
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:12,255
And by the way,
women kill for eyebrows like that.

96
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:16,287
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows...

97
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:19,359
...out of their head one by one...

98
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,879
...until they're bald, Jerry,
bald above the eyes.

99
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,247
And then they paint in these eyebrows
to look like that.

100
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,583
Well, let me tell you something
about George.

101
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,723
He is fast.

102
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:33,225
He can run like the wind.

103
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,695
And he's strong.

104
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:37,829
I’ve seen him lift 1 00 pounds over
his head without even knowing it.

105
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:41,254
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but George can bait a hook.

106
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:43,753
-He can really do that?
-Come on, let's do it.

107
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,512
I think they'll really get along.

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,357
-What, are you into this?
-Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,271
Wait. They'll be telling us how
their dates went.

110
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,993
We going to share
that information?

111
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,503
Naturally.

112
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:00,684
We're going to tell each other
everything? Every secret?

113
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,157
Everything.

114
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,550
-What if it worked out?
-Yeah, right

115
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:10,321
Out of the question.

116
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,010
Out of the question.

117
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:15,344
-Why?
-No. I’m not going to do that.

118
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:18,192
It’s one step away from personal ads.

119
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,332
Then prostitutes.

120
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:23,852
No! No! I am not going
down that road.

121
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:31,065
What does she look like?

122
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,940
-She's good-looking.
-How good-looking?

123
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,830
-Very good-looking.
-Really good-looking?

124
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,362
-Really very good-looking.
-Would you take her out?

125
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,340
-Yes, I would.
-You hesitated.

126
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:44,087
-What hesitate? I didn't hesitate.
-Something's up. You hesitated.

127
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,392
I’m telling you, she's good-looking.

128
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,498
-What about the body?
-Good body. Nice body.

129
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,604
-How nice?
-Nice. Pretty nice.

130
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:55,036
-Really good?
-Really very nice and good.

131
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:03,000
-What about personality?
-Good personality.

132
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,037
Funny. Bright.

133
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,089
I don't want anyone smarter than me.

134
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,098
How could she be smarter than you?

135
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:18,044
All right, let's see. Let's see.
What else? What else?

136
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,064
What does she do?

137
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:22,209
First of all, what does he do?

138
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,032
He was in real estate.

139
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:26,402
He's not working right now.

140
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:29,087
Oh! He's not working?
No. No. No.

141
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:31,011
How come he's not working?

142
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:33,926
Well, I mean, he got fired.

143
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,298
Why did he get fired?

144
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:43,205
Oh, right. Um, well....

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,405
He tried to...poison his boss.

146
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,262
Excuse me?

147
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:53,547
It’s such a long story. Seriously,
he just had some problems at work.

148
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,651
-Is he nuts?
-No, no, no.

149
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,985
He's a really, really funny guy.

150
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,490
What does he look like?

151
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,722
-Pardon?
-What does he look like?

152
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:07,463
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

153
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:11,048
He's short. Um, he's stocky.

154
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:12,427
He's fat.

155
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,317
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

156
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,755
Powerful.

157
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:21,586
He is so powerful. He can lift
1 00 pounds right up over his head.

158
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,177
And, um...what else? What else?

159
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,762
Oh, right, well....

160
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:31,189
He's, he's kind of--
Just kind of-- Losing his hair.

161
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,162
-He's bald?
-No.

162
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,292
No, no, no. He's not bald.

163
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,251
He's balding.

164
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:42,414
-So he will be bald?
-Yeah.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,939
-What kind of hair?
-You know, long, dark hair.

166
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,511
Flowing?

167
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,907
Flowing?

168
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,193
Is it flowing? I like flowing,
cascading hair.

169
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,689
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

170
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,337
''Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.''

171
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,843
-Is that what you said?
-Right.

172
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,566
Just clarifying.

173
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,766
Let me ask you this.

174
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,091
lf you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easy to get it out?

175
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:24,895
Do you want to get it out?

176
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,425
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

177
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,912
-I’d like to be able to get it out.
-I think you'll get it out.

178
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,217
What about the skin?

179
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,485
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

180
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,017
She's got a fine cheek.

181
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,707
Is there a pinkish hue?

182
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,657
-A pinkish hue?
-Yes, a rosy glow.

183
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,116
There's a hue.

184
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:53,311
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

185
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,932
Who cares about eyebrows?

186
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:02,153
Is she sweet? I like sweet.

187
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,124
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

188
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,467
I don't think you'll throw up.

189
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,928
She likes to throw up.

190
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:22,541
-Has he ever been married?
-No.

191
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:24,969
Has he been close?

192
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:28,390
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

193
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:34,217
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

194
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,139
Yeah, he did.

195
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,539
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

196
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:44,333
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.

197
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,283
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

198
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:51,984
I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

199
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:53,491
Is it ''timbre'' or ''tambre''?

200
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,622
-I think it's tambre.
-Why'd I think timbre?

201
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,220
She could do voice-overs.

202
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,886
You didn't tell me about her voice?

203
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,926
-I didn't notice the voice.
-It’s mellifluous.

204
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,583
So, Saturday night.

205
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:07,892
She had to be impressed
by that conversation.

206
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:10,841
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

207
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:15,509
On the date, they should just have two
phones on the table at the restaurant.

208
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,037
-Hi.
-Hi!

209
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:22,072
-Out we go Saturday night.
-I know.

210
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:26,264
-So, what did she say?
-You're getting together Saturday night.

211
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,845
-That's it?
-Yeah.

212
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,307
-She didn't mention the conversation?
-No.

213
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:37,142
See? I don't get that.

214
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,085
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great
conversation. She doesn't mention it?

215
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,427
-Why not mention it?
-What?

216
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,120
She could have mentioned it.

217
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,455
All right. All right. I’ll go on the date,
but that's that.

218
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,617
You know my friend Bob Sakamano?

219
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:58,979
-The guy from Jersey.
-He just got a job at a condom factory.

220
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,044
Look at this. He gave me a gross.

221
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:08,513
-What will you do with all of them?
-Oh, well....

222
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,455
Take some, Jerry. Grab them.

223
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,309
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

224
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,605
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.

225
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,644
Half a bag?

226
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:27,111
What am l, a hooker?

227
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,887
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

228
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,053
I’ll take one.

229
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:39,332
It’s possible.

230
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:44,169
The problem with the condom
is still buying them.

231
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:48,592
I think we should have, like,
a secret signal with the druggist.

232
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,339
You walk into the store,
go to the counter. He looks at you.

233
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,197
And if you go like this--

234
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,489
He puts them in the bag
for you. That's it.

235
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,105
Show up there with your little
shaving cream, your little toothpaste.

236
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,696
How are you today?

237
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,427
''Have a nice day.'' ''You too.''

238
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:13,459
So where are they? It’s 11:45.
They should be back by now.

239
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,176
-What did they do?
-I think they went out to dinner.

240
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,547
Oh, wait. I got another call.
That must be him.

241
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,337
-Hello.
-It’s me. I just got home.

242
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:21,846
Hold on.

243
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:25,079
-It’s George. He just got home.
-Yeah. I got Cynthia on the line.

244
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,984
-I’ll call you back when I’m done.
-Remember our pact: full disclosure.

245
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,739
Of course.

246
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,567
Yeah, go ahead.

247
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:35,729
I’m gonna tell you,
but I made a pact with Cynthia.

248
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,842
We swore we wouldn't tell
you and Elaine.

249
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,084
-You can tell. I’ll vault it.
-It’s in the vault?

250
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,220
I’m locking the vault. What? Come on.

251
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,161
-We had sex.
-Oh, my God, you had sex?

252
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,017
-How did that happen?
-I don't know.

253
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,775
I closed my eyes and made a move.

254
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,220
-At your apartment?
-Yeah.

255
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,271
-She didn't stay over?
-No. She left.

256
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,986
Listen, you can't mention
any of this to Elaine.

257
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,739
Cynthia will kill me. We made a deal.

258
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:01,371
Oh, my God.

259
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,709
He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

260
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,941
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

261
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,798
-What?
-He says the kitchen...

262
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,719
...is the most sociable room
in the house.

263
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,094
And he was serious.

264
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,262
-So how was it?
-How good could it be?

265
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,600
My head was on a hot plate.

266
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,967
I got another call. Must be Jerry.

267
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:23,430
-Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
-Yeah, okay.

268
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,231
-Hello?
-So, what did she say?

269
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,182
-What did he have to say?
-He said he had a good time.

270
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,673
-Her too.
-Oh, good.

271
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,366
-Anything else?
-No.

272
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,866
-You?
-No.

273
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,526
-You sure?
-Yeah.

274
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:42,660
-You?
-Yeah.

275
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46,950
All right, well....

276
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,701
I guess everything is under control.

277
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,073
Yeah. Okay then.

278
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,514
Alrighty.

279
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,213
-Good night.
-Good night.

280
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:01,995
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.

281
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,542
We have sex, she leaves 1 0 minutes
later, then I never hear from her again.

282
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,370
What kind of a person does this?

283
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:11,693
She used me. I feel cheap and violated.

284
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,572
-I’m gonna do something about this.
-What are you gonna do?

285
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,649
Never mind. Disgraceful.

286
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,577
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen
floor like some kind of roach trap.

287
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,045
''Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.''

288
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,319
''Sir.'' Whatever.

289
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,691
She's not gonna get away with this.

290
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:36,334
I keep racking my brain
to try to figure out what I did.

291
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,260
I was smart. I was funny.

292
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,334
I made great small talk
with the waitress...

293
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,960
...so she could see I could relate
to the commoners.

294
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,820
I’m a man of the people.

295
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,520
-I’m gonna call her.
-Don't call.

296
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,464
-No, I’m calling her.
-No, Jerry, I don't want you to.

297
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,666
-Get away from me.
-Give me the phone.

298
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,770
-You wanna fight me?
-Jerry, I’m gonna kill you.

299
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:56,762
Hey, hey, hey!

300
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,648
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.

301
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,371
I’ll just call her when you leave.

302
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,751
It’s none of your business!

303
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,056
-It is so my business.
-Give me that!

304
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,978
Stop it, boys!

305
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,773
I don't want another word
from either of you.

306
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,048
-Tell him--
-Hey, hey, hey!

307
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:18,966
The next one of you that opens your
mouth, you'll have to deal with me.

308
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,614
I bet I know what this is about.
It’s about a woman, isn't it?

309
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,400
-Yeah, but--
-You see!

310
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,426
This is exactly what they want
to do to you.

311
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,343
They play one against the other.

312
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,427
You can't let them
manipulate you like that.

313
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,930
-But, Kramer--
-No, no, no!

314
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,816
I want you guys to shake hands.

315
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,663
Come on, there are plenty women
out there for all of us.

316
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:39,071
Shake.

317
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,089
Yes! You see?

318
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,938
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?

319
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:46,973
You wanna fight with somebody,
you fight with me.

320
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,383
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective. Don't use them.

321
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,036
-What?
-Yeah.

322
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02,025
-Defective?
-Yeah.

323
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:04,521
How could you give me
a defective condom?

324
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,658
I didn't even know
they were defective.

325
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,926
-Didn't think you'd use them.
-What do you mean--?!

326
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,263
Take it easy.

327
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,317
Just spread out!

328
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:25,520
Don't worry. lf anything was wrong,
she'd have called you.

329
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,743
I missed my period.

330
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,959
Oh, my God!

331
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:34,798
I am very worried. I am never late.

332
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,783
But he used a condom, right?

333
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,730
I know, but these things
aren't always foolproof.

334
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,858
Oh, no.

335
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,841
What?

336
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,379
Was it blue?

337
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,215
Yeah. How'd you know?

338
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,194
Just a hunch.

339
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:03,095
It says ''twist-off.''
Twist off! Twist! Off!

340
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,833
Oh, hi. Soda?

341
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,072
No, thanks.

342
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,635
So tell me.

343
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:15,448
What's the problem with your little
flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

344
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,267
Who are you to talk
about her like that?

345
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,284
She'll call him when she's
good and ready.

346
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,386
-You don't even know her.
-Oh, I know her.

347
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,897
I know her type.

348
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,550
Her type? What type?

349
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,213
The type that doesn't return calls.

350
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:31,547
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea. I told you.

351
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,527
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

352
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:35,965
It was your idea.

353
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,366
I was just helping your bitter,
twisted friend.

354
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,093
She's not bitter.

355
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:42,014
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.

356
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:45,440
Twisted? God, I did you a favor!

357
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,418
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?

358
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,198
-Are you calling me a liar?
-I’m calling you one if you are.

359
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,219
-Are you?
-Get your finger out of my face.

360
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,421
-Get yours out.
-I don't care.

361
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,923
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

362
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,704
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!

363
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,780
Come on. Break it up!

364
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,770
Hey, hey!

365
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,206
What's the matter with you?

366
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:12,836
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

367
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,283
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

368
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,166
You're running around looking
for something not even there...

369
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:23,430
...when everything you dream of
is right here in front of you.

370
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,384
Now why can't you admit that?

371
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,908
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

372
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:33,863
I knew those condoms
were defective!

373
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,068
How did you know
they were defective?!

374
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,516
Because! Because she missed
her period!

375
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:44,105
She missed her period?

376
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,133
Oh, my God!

377
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,277
I can't believe it.

378
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,152
I’m a father! I did it!

379
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,817
My boys can swim!

380
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,948
I can do it! I can do it!
I’m a father!

381
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,636
So he shows up. He's all out of breath.
He's disheveled.

382
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,989
And tells me that whatever happens,
whatever I decide is fine with him...

383
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,006
...and I could depend on him...

384
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:17,267
...and that he'd support me
in whatever way I need.

385
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,145
Elaine, I was speechless.

386
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,797
Wow. Wow. You see?
You think you know somebody.

387
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:27,508
I said to him, ''I really appreciate this,
but I just got my period.''

388
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:29,267
-Yeah.
-So I asked him to come in--

389
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,744
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

390
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:34,999
Sorry we're late. We got so
hung up in traffic. I’m sorry.

391
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,811
-What happened?
-Acting.

392
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,908
-Very mature.
-Thank you.

393
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,235
-Hi, Cynthia.
-Hi.

394
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,676
This is a great place to sit
you got here.

395
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,073
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.

396
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,149
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

397
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,568
-So, what are these?
-We ordered appetizers. Start eating.

398
00:20:58,145 --> 00:20:59,552
Oh, fabulous.

399
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:04,696
This is good. Oh, this is good.

400
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,644
Is that salt on this?

401
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,919
Is there salt on this?

402
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,969
But have you ever fixed anybody up?

403
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,955
Why do we do it? Why?

404
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,063
You thought
they'd have a good time...

405
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,172
...and little power trips
for you, isn't it?

406
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,130
Now you're playing God.

407
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:23,229
Of course, God was
the first person to fix people up.

408
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,254
He fixed up Adam and Eve.

409
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,205
I’m sure he said to Adam,
''No, she's nice.

410
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:32,671
She's-- Yes, she's very free
about her body.

411
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,914
Doesn't really wear much.

412
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:38,247
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though.''
