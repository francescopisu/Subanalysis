1
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,894
Do you think that the people
at the airport...

2
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:07,068
...that run the stores
have any idea...

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:10,083
...what the prices are everyplace else
in the world...

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,279
...or do they just feel they have
their own little country out there...

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,269
...and they can charge
anything they want?

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,366
''You hungry? Tuna sandwich is $<i>9</i>.

7
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,220
You don't like it,
go back to your own country.''

8
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,654
I think the whole
airport-airline complex...

9
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:26,950
...is a huge scam just to sell
the tuna sandwiches.

10
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:30,979
I think that profit is what's supporting
the whole air travel industry.

11
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,735
I mean, think about it.
The terminals, the airplanes...

12
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,397
...it's all just a distraction...

13
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,634
...so that you don't notice the beating
that you're taking on the tuna.

14
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,215
It's all departures.
I see nothing but departures.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,355
Do you know where the arrivals are?

16
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,512
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

17
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,109
There's a clock over there.

18
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:59,378
-Where?
-Over there.

19
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,706
-But you have a watch on.
-It’s right by the escalator.

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,787
Why not just look at your watch?

21
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,346
I told you, it's right over there.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,831
-Let me see the watch.
-Hey!

23
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:13,560
What are you, some kind of nut?

24
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,564
You know, we're living in a society!

25
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,568
-George.
-Jerry, Jerry.

26
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,707
The flight was delayed.
How long you been here?

27
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,594
I just got here. My car broke down
on the Belt Parkway.

28
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:28,830
I can't believe--
Get rid of that piece of junk.

29
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:31,847
One mile from the exit,
it starts shaking, violently shaking...

30
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,666
...like it's having
a nervous breakdown.

31
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:36,550
-Then it completely stopped dead.
-So you have no car.

32
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,754
-No.
-So, what good are you?

33
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,400
This chauffeur's gonna be
waiting a while.

34
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,638
-O'Brien's not showing up.
-How do you know?

35
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,562
He was in Chicago.
Flight was overbooked.

36
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:48,937
They wouldn't let him on.

37
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:52,235
He kept screaming how he had
to get to Madison Square Garden.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,605
-We should take his limo.
-Yeah, right.

39
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:00,625
Wait a second. Think about it.

40
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:02,867
He's not showing up.

41
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,550
Wait till you see the line for cabs.
It’s 45 minutes long.

42
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:08,530
-You said he's in Chicago.
-He's definitely in Chicago.

43
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:11,316
Well, that guy is just standing there.

44
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:16,570
-How would we do it?
-Just go up and say, ''We're O'Brien.''

45
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,628
-Maybe he knows O'Brien.
-He doesn't know him.

46
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:23,285
lf he knew O'Brien,
he wouldn't have a sign.

47
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,421
-Let's just do it.
-What if we get caught?

48
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,112
What's gonna happen?
They can't kill us.

49
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,985
-Who's gonna be O'Brien?
-I’ll be O'Brien.

50
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,257
-Who am l?
-You're you.

51
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,143
-Just me?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:41,438
-Okay.
-You don't wanna be you?

53
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:44,476
Well, if you're gonna be O'Brien,
why can't I be somebody?

54
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,708
-Like who?
-Dylan Murphy.

55
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,685
Okay.

56
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,495
-Now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
-Well, I like Dylan.

57
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:57,032
You could be Colin.

58
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:58,630
Okay. Colin O'Brien.

59
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:01,034
-I’m Dylan Murphy.
-I’m Colin O'Brien.

60
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:04,741
-Are we really doing this?
-Come on.

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,910
-Hey, do you have the time?
-Clock over there.

62
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,800
-O'Brien.
-Yes, sir.

63
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,968
Sorry we're late.

64
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,896
-Let me take that for you.
-Oh, thank you.

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,963
-I’ll bring the car around front.
-Thank you very much.

66
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,974
-Dylan.
-Colin.

67
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,604
Can you believe this?
This is incredible.

68
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,104
This is one of the greatest things
I’ve ever done.

69
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,340
-I’m gonna call my mother.
-What for?

70
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,548
To tell her I’m in a limo.

71
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,589
Hello, Ma? It’s me.

72
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,047
Guess where I am.
In the back of a limo.

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,834
No, nobody died.

74
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,685
It’s a long story. I can't tell you now.

75
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,192
Because I can't.

76
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,915
I said, I can't.

77
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,860
lf I could, I would.

78
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,874
Would you stop it? All right, look--

79
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,248
I’m getting off.

80
00:03:57,414 --> 00:04:00,482
No, I’m not telling you.
How's this? I’m never telling you.

81
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,787
I don't care. No! Fine!

82
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,709
Never!

83
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:09,319
She happy for you?

84
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:12,648
Can he hear us?

85
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:13,991
Why?

86
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:16,263
Thought I saw him look
in the mirror suspiciously.

87
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,740
He can't hear us.

88
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,694
Let's test him.

89
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,029
Hey, driver.

90
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:24,747
What do you say we stop off,
pick up your sister...

91
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,409
...have a little fun back here?

92
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,962
No. He can't hear us.

93
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,973
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we
can get him to drop us at my house.

94
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:35,628
I’ll ask him.

95
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:40,174
My dear fellow,
where are you dropping us?

96
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:43,313
At Madison Square Garden, of course.
I have the four passes.

97
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,425
Of course, the four passes.

98
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,797
Four passes to
Madison Square Garden?

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,168
Wait a minute.

100
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,929
Wait a minute. Of course.

101
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,274
Chicago!

102
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,350
The Knicks are playing
the Bulls tonight!

103
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:02,010
-What?
-We are going to the Knick game!

104
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,251
Michael Jordan!

105
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,394
We're going to the game!
Four free passes!

106
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:10,144
-Did I tell you? Did I tell you?
-I can't believe it!

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,383
-You may have hit with this one.
-You see?

108
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,447
You see, I see things as they are
and I say, ''No.''

109
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,871
Wait. You see things
as they are not and you say--

110
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,104
Wait. You see thing--

111
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,802
Do you see things as they are?

112
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:26,566
What do you say
when you see things?

113
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,836
Let me call Elaine and Kramer.

114
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:34,151
lf I see things as they are,
I would ask, ''Why?'' or ''Why not?''

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,688
Elaine? It’s me.

116
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,192
What are you doing tonight?

117
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:41,967
Great. George and I have tickets--
Four free passes...

118
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:45,394
...to the Knicks-Bulls game
at Madison Square Garden.

119
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,505
Can you go?

120
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,054
Great. Call Kramer, tell him to meet
us on the corner at 7:00.

121
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:54,388
All right. We're gonna
pick you up in a limo.

122
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,920
That's right, baby doll.

123
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:01,077
And listen, when we pick you up,
I’m Murphy and George is O'Brien.

124
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,349
I can't tell you now. It’s a long story.

125
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:05,143
I am serious.

126
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,198
Okay. Okay, bye.

127
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,941
Excuse me, driver,
we have to make a little stop first.

128
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:16,383
I know.

129
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:20,673
-He knows?
-He knows?

130
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:27,068
Where we going?
Why are we pulling off here?

131
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,646
Maybe it's a shortcut.

132
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,362
We're going to Grand Central.
There's no traffic.

133
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,042
Excuse me,
why are we getting off this exit?

134
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,415
To pick up the other members
of your party.

135
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,266
Right. The other members
of our party.

136
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,013
What other members
of our party?

137
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:46,030
I didn't even know
we were in a party.

138
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,533
I’m telling you, the jig is up.

139
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,868
It was a bad jig.
We never should've started it.

140
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,449
-It was a good jig.
-It was a bad jig. A terrible, terrible jig.

141
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:56,172
What are we gonna do now?
They'll know you're not O'Brien.

142
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,762
There could be more than one O'Brien
who ordered a limo.

143
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,869
-First, you don't look like any O'Brien.
-You should've been O'Brien.

144
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,177
I don't wanna be Murphy anymore.
Do I have to be?

145
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:07,192
-Yes, you have to be Murphy.
-It makes no sense, me being Murphy.

146
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,662
-You're Murphy.
-I’m Seinfeld.

147
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,134
You're Murphy!

148
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,088
Let's just jump out of the car.

149
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,073
We're doing 60 miles an hour.

150
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,570
So we jump and roll.
You won't get hurt.

151
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,643
Who are you, Mannix?

152
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,218
Why are we slowing down?

153
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,520
Are those the people?

154
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:26,167
All right, put your hands up over
your face. Pretend you're sleeping.

155
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,603
-Mr. O'Brien.
-No, I’m Dylan Murphy.

156
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,653
Mr. O'Brien had a long trip.
He's sleeping.

157
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,076
I don't wanna disturb him.

158
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,423
We're just really excited to meet him
face-to-face finally.

159
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,108
We're faithful readers
of his newsletter.

160
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,434
-Newsletter?
-And, of course, his great book...

161
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,914
... <i>The Big Game</i>.

162
00:07:56,429 --> 00:08:00,587
Oh, yes, he's very proud
of his work in <i>The Big Game</i>.

163
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:04,588
-So you've never met him before?
-No.

164
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:07,627
-Never seen a picture of him?
-Never.

165
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,394
Not even on the book jacket?

166
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,946
There was no picture
on the book jacket.

167
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,249
Hey, O'Brien, wake up. Come on.
We got company.

168
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:16,909
Wake up.

169
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:23,631
Well, hello. I’m O'Brien.

170
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,227
-Hey!
-Hey.

171
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,284
You took a cab?

172
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,140
Yeah. So?

173
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,611
How much do you make?

174
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,149
-I’m not telling you.
-Come on.

175
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,199
-No.
-I’ll tell you how much I make.

176
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,822
I know how much you make.

177
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,338
I don't even know why I’m doing this.
I don't even like basketball.

178
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:49,663
-You ever seen Michael Jordan?
-Just in those commercials.

179
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,732
Maybe you'll see him do
one of those 360 dunks.

180
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,370
-What's that?
-It’s like this.

181
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,291
-Here, you guard me.
-What?

182
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,150
I never get the tinted windows
on the limo.

183
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,725
Nobody cares who's in the limo.

184
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,275
You see a limo go by,
you know it's either a rich guy...

185
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,390
...or 50 prom kids with $ 1 .75 each.

186
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,617
Being in the back of a limo,
I’m sorry, it's just--

187
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,114
It’s not that cool.
Most of the time, you feel like...

188
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:27,953
...you're in some depressing single
guy's apartment from, like, 1 <i>9</i> 75.

189
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:30,801
All that maroon velour furniture...

190
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,902
...couple of bottles of wine,
three cassette tapes. There's stains.

191
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:37,172
You're counting, there must've been
1 0,000 asses already on this seat.

192
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,788
-I don't think we'll make the tip-off.
-Think someone's been tipped off?

193
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,104
So....

194
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:48,371
You've read <i>The Big Game</i>,
have you?

195
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,997
Yes, I’ve read it.
And I’ve memorized it.

196
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,108
Well, tell me your impressions.

197
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,511
I would love to hear what a young
woman thinks of <i>The Big Game</i>.

198
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:59,641
Well, this is sort of embarrassing.

199
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,432
But it's changed my life.

200
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,484
The way you analyze the game...

201
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,673
...the way you identify
the major players....

202
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,295
Well, it left me breathless.

203
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,348
You're a brilliant...

204
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,520
...brilliant man.

205
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,654
Well, it's.... It’s just a game.

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,249
Remember that, kids.

207
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,007
''Just a game.'' He's so humble.

208
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,246
Don't forget what you wrote
in the epilogue:

209
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:30,245
''The fate of the world depends
on the outcome of this game.''

210
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:33,482
Well, I was exaggerating a bit.
Just for effect.

211
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,066
-He tends to exaggerate.
-I mean, it's serious, but--

212
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:41,066
We are really looking forward
to your speech tonight.

213
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:43,956
My speech.

214
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,185
Yes, your secretary
faxed me the copy.

215
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,479
Would you like to
look it over?

216
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,049
Well, you might as well
look it over.

217
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:58,484
So, what's going on?
How did all this happen?

218
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:00,562
Jerry and George called me
from this limo.

219
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,905
They said we're all going
to the Knicks-Bulls game.

220
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,248
Limo?

221
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,324
I thought that George went
to pick him up.

222
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,673
He did.

223
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:10,076
Then why would they take a limo
from the airport?

224
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,419
I don't know.

225
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:14,073
That's pretty strange.

226
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,804
Did he say anything else?

227
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,340
Yeah. He said it's really important...

228
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,950
...that we call them
O'Brien and Murphy.

229
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,496
O'Brien? Why would he
wanna be called O'Brien?

230
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:32,100
''And the Jews steal our money...

231
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:35,115
...through their
Zionist-occupied government...

232
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:38,343
...and use the black man
to bring drugs...

233
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,286
...into our oppressed
white minority communities.''

234
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:46,284
You're not gonna open with that,
are you?

235
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,805
What was that you said
about the myth of the Holocaust?

236
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,362
Said so many things.

237
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,921
They're shooting! They're shooting!

238
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,649
All right, get down.

239
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,666
I’m ready to die for you.

240
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,719
Oh, that's really very nice of you,
Eva, thank you.

241
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,831
But of course, you know, I would.

242
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,391
I would do anything for you.

243
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:28,384
Anything.

244
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:31,834
Nothing to worry about,
it was a flat tire.

245
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,659
But rest assured...

246
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:37,469
...we're prepared to handle anything
that might come up.

247
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,593
Nice-looking Luger.

248
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:51,043
I’m at The Paramount,
adjacent to Madison Square Garden...

249
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,897
...where a growing number of
vociferous, angry demonstrators...

250
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:57,325
...gather to protest the first public
appearance of Donald O'Brien...

251
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:00,303
...leader of the Midwestern
regional chapter of the Aryan Union...

252
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,920
...and reputed to be their most
charismatic spokesman.

253
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,572
Mr. O'Brien advocates the
violent overthrow of the government.

254
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,934
He has openly professed
a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler.

255
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,655
Even David Duke has denounced him
as a dangerous extremist.

256
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,758
There is a full house inside
awaiting his arrival from the airport.

257
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,377
Sources tell me he is en route
and should be arriving momentarily.

258
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:22,001
Police have set up barricades,
but, quite frankly, Bill...

259
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,400
...I don't think they're any match for
the emotional fuse that has been lit.

260
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:29,078
From The Paramount, I’m Jodi
Baskerville. Back to you in the studio.

261
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,192
Something's very strange here.

262
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:33,398
George goes to the airport
to pick up Jerry.

263
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,568
They come back in a limo with
four tickets to the basketball game...

264
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,493
...and wanna be called
O'Brien and Murphy.

265
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,589
O'Brien. O'Brien. Why O'Brien?

266
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:44,829
Elaine?

267
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,330
-Dan.
-Excuse me a minute. Hey.

268
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,877
-Hi, Dan. How are you?
-Good.

269
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,495
-Oh, this is Kramer.
-Oh, Kramer.

270
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,667
What's going on?

271
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:01,283
We're headed down to protest
this big neo-Nazi rally.

272
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:04,103
The head of the Aryan Union is
speaking. He's in from Chicago.

273
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:07,051
-You should come.
-Oh, we can't.

274
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,124
We're going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

275
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:12,776
Oh, well, that's where the rally is.
At The Paramount, right next door.

276
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:16,358
-Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
-Yeah, it's really gonna be something.

277
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,433
First time he's appeared in public.
No one knows what he looks like.

278
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,971
-Who?
-The head of the Aryan Union.

279
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:23,441
O'Brien.

280
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:31,184
What's taking them
so long out there?

281
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,103
Did you see the way
she was looking at me?

282
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,451
-She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi.
-I know, I know.

283
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,585
Kind of a cute Nazi, though.

284
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:43,826
We gotta make a plan.

285
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,524
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

286
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:48,827
-Let's just make a run for it.
-I can't run. I have a bad hamstring.

287
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,966
-How'd that happen?
-I hurt it in a hotel room.

288
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,625
Know how they tuck the covers in
real tight in those rooms?

289
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,445
I can't sleep like that.
I tried to kick it out and pulled it.

290
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:59,907
Why do they make that bed so tight?
You gotta sleep with your feet like that:

291
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:04,892
It’s for a mental patient. Wait a minute,
the phone. We'll call the police.

292
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:06,722
<i>9</i>1 1 .

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,790
She said she'd do anything.

294
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,288
Yeah, hello. Police?
Yeah, listen...

295
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,590
...we're in the back of a limo
in Queens--

296
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,824
AstroTurf?

297
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,036
You know who's
responsible for that, don't you?

298
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,962
The Jews!

299
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:25,258
Oh, the Jews hate grass.
They always have, always will.

300
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,529
We'll be ready in a minute.

301
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,388
Would you excuse us a minute,
Tim Boy?

302
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,179
We're in the middle
of something here.

303
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:34,282
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien,
we're just about to leave.

304
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,479
Tim?

305
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:44,655
Who's the head of the Aryan Union?

306
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,712
-You or me?
-You are.

307
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,524
And who is responsible
for making hatemongering...

308
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,408
-...and fascism popular again?
-You are.

309
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,285
Okay?

310
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,586
I think you forgot something.

311
00:15:58,494 --> 00:16:00,055
-I’m sorry.
-Good.

312
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:01,629
Now get out.

313
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:07,225
-All right, what are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

314
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:10,143
How's this: we wait till we get
to your street corner...

315
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:12,217
...we see Elaine and Kramer,
then we get out.

316
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,396
-They can't shoot us in the city.
-No.

317
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,453
No one's ever been shot in the city.

318
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,730
I’m telling you,
something is going on.

319
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:24,515
I can feel it, sense it.

320
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,391
-I’m sure he was just joking around.
-Oh, no, this is no joke.

321
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,938
O'Brien's coming in from Chicago.
Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien.

322
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,418
That's not funny.

323
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,987
Oh, my God.

324
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,703
Yes. Yes!

325
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:43,531
What? What is it?

326
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,672
Don't you see?
There's always been something...

327
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:49,455
...very strange about Jerry.
Always so clean and organized.

328
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,824
-So?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?

329
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,712
The limo? The name?

330
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,050
The rally at Madison Square Garden?

331
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,063
Jerry and O'Brien
are the same person.

332
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,841
Jerry is the leader
of the Aryan Union.

333
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,187
Jerry's a Nazi?

334
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,578
I can't even believe I didn't see it.

335
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:10,261
Listen, you idiot, just calm down.

336
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,884
I know Jerry. He's not a Nazi.

337
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:16,251
-You don't think so?
-No. He's just neat.

338
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,636
You know, it's funny.

339
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:26,946
You don't look like an O'Brien.

340
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,707
Me?

341
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,001
Yeah, right. Get a load of this guy.

342
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,771
-And you don't look like a Murphy.
-I may not look like one...

343
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:40,385
-...but I act like a Murphy.
-He's extremely Murphy. To a fault.

344
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:41,956
Where are you from?

345
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,547
Dublin. Originally.

346
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,618
Parents came over here
when I was 1 8.

347
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:48,966
Cereal famine.

348
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,753
Couldn't get a bowl anywhere.
It was bad.

349
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,742
'Tis a beautiful country, though.

350
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:57,450
Lush rolling hills. And the peat.

351
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:58,992
The peat.

352
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,674
Sounds more like Scottish.

353
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,436
We were right on the border.

354
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,379
Maybe he's with the company.

355
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,679
-What?
-The ClA.

356
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:13,841
Maybe they placed him in there to
infiltrate the organization from within.

357
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,398
-What about his comedy act?
-That's the perfect cover.

358
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:18,291
All that time on the road.

359
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,077
Look, Jerry, he's too normal
to be a comedian.

360
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,382
These comedians,
they're sick, neurotic people.

361
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,390
-Well, what about George?
-What about him? He's part of it.

362
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:29,624
His whole personality's a disguise.

363
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,930
There's no real person
can act the way he does.

364
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:34,623
Elaine, I’m telling you,
they're with the organization.

365
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,215
They're all part of it.

366
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:39,583
He's in there with Helms and Hunt
and Liddy, that whole crowd.

367
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:42,114
George and Jerry, they probably know
who killed Kennedy.

368
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:43,738
I bet they were even in on it.

369
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,516
All right, what are we gonna do?
What--?

370
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,430
I’m not gonna let them hurt you.
I’m not gonna--

371
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,349
Kramer, you're hurting me.

372
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:56,069
Those are our friends
I told you about.

373
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,569
-Get off of me!
-We're gonna talk to them. Pull over.

374
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,325
-Get off of me!
-It’s all right.

375
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,565
-Get off!
-Hey, O'Brien!

376
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,911
-O'Brien!
-Is that him?

377
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,834
-Yeah, that's him!
-Look, there's O'Brien!

378
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,243
No-good Nazi bastard!

379
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,749
-Let's get him!
-Get him!

380
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,472
-What do we do?
-Get in the car!

381
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,845
-Get in the car!
-What? What?

382
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,830
Come on, hey!

383
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,046
O'Brien. Long time, no see.
How's tricks, Murphy?

384
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:28,279
Why did you call him O'Brien
and him Murphy?

385
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,310
No, he was talking to me.
He's cross-eyed.

386
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:33,042
It could be very confusing.

387
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:38,550
Yeah?

388
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:41,497
-Eva?
-It’s for me.

389
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:44,664
Hello?

390
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:49,629
It’s O'Brien.

391
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,934
O'Brien?

392
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,631
Well, that's weird.

393
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,311
Who are you?

394
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,675
-I’m Jerry Seinfeld.
-I’m George Costanza.

395
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:02,082
This is a misunderstanding.

396
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:04,003
His car broke down.
I told him to get--

397
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,502
My car started shaking violently
about a mile out.

398
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,219
-So he picks me up without a car.
-And there was a line--

399
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,695
The limo has just pulled up.

400
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:13,063
It’s being surrounded by
a huge crowd of protesters.

401
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,137
This has the makings of
a very ugly scene.

402
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,097
I just didn't have
anything to do tonight.

403
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,952
Then the phone rang
and it was Jerry.

404
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,967
We just wanted a ride
into the city.

405
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,517
He was supposed to pick me up,
but he didn't pick me up.

406
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,958
And tonight we were gonna go
to the basketball game--

407
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:29,293
They're banging on the car,
trying to flip it over.

408
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,526
The police seem unable
or unwilling to control the crowd.

409
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,595
I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be
having some very grave doubts...

410
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,286
...if he made the right choice
for his first appearance.

411
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,844
We did not want to
antagonize the Nazis.

412
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:42,925
We have no intention
of upsetting the Nazis.

413
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:45,650
-I don't have a problem with Nazis.
-Do whatever you want.

414
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:50,870
-Don't bother us, we won't bother you.
-I don't wanna make a Nazi unhappy.

415
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,498
-I swear. I swear.
-I swear.

416
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,873
-I swear.
-I swear.

417
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,405
-Get out!
-Open the door.

418
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,160
Oh, look! Look, it's Dan.

419
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,080
-Hi, Dan!
-Elaine?

420
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,383
-Hi! Dan!
-Come on, let's go. Go.

421
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,671
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien!

422
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,080
I repeat, I am not O'Brien!

423
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,245
Ask anyone. Jerry! Jerry!

424
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:16,578
So I was watching this movie
the other night, a World War II movie.

425
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,435
And there was Nazis in the movie.

426
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,416
And I noticed that the Nazis
in those movies...

427
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,487
...always had, like,
two separate <i>Heil</i>s.

428
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,245
They had the regular <i>Heil</i>
that they would do...

429
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,608
...and when they were around the
offices, they had this casual <i>Heil</i>.

430
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,497
Remember that?
They'd come in the office:

431
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,571
''Yeah, <i>Heil</i>, how are you? What's...?

432
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,842
Is the kid back with coffee? Come on,
are you finished with the copier?

433
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,699
Yeah, world domination, Aryan race.

434
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,353
So whose doughnuts are those?
Yeah, <i>Heil</i>. Nice to see you.

435
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:43,082
Can I have one
of those doughnuts?''
