1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,629
''This guy's the best.''
They can't all be the best.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,588
There can't be this many bests.

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,694
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

5
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:16,765
Where are these doctors?

6
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:18,886
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

7
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:21,698
''You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,740
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

9
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:28,199
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,109
He's just a-- He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher.''

11
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:36,066
Then there's always that, ''Make sure
you tell him that you know me.''

12
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:38,119
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

13
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,767
What is he--?
''Oh, you know Bob.

14
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:44,132
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

15
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:47,172
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs.''

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:57,534
And usually for lunch, I’ll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

17
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:01,127
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

18
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:04,865
Excuse me?

19
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,493
You know, if you were blind...

20
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:09,281
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,589
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,679
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

23
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:22,086
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,728
I’d constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

25
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:30,653
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

26
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:34,369
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

27
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,030
No.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,720
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

29
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,987
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

30
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,407
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

31
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,902
And these people
are all over the place.

32
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:52,255
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

33
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,608
Have you seen any good movies?

34
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,532
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

35
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,998
We have a woman. Why?

36
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,910
-No, I’m just saying.
-She had references.

37
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:06,657
I’m sure she did.
I’m sure they're impeccable.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,869
I’m talking about the ones
that forge them.

39
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,614
You know,
I think this is really helping.

40
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:17,442
I don't live near here, you know.

41
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:25,028
So she's giving me the massage
and I’m just making conversation.

42
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:28,421
-I don't like to talk during a massage.
-Neither do I, but I do it for them.

43
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,951
-I figure they're bored.
-Yeah, I do that too.

44
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:34,909
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,804
It stops me from enjoying it.

46
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,429
There's nothing to eat in here.

47
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,414
-I forgot to tell you.
-I’m in the middle of a story.

48
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,910
-Okay, go ahead.
-Why don't you ever go shopping?

49
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,177
It's not like it's a really funny story.

50
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:49,857
-What happened?
-So she mentioned that she had a son.

51
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,584
And then for some reason...

52
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:55,429
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

53
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,894
-Oh, wasn't that terrible?
-Yes, it was.

54
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,234
Not even an apple.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,407
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

56
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,910
-I know it was stupid.
-Really stupid.

57
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:05,566
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

58
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,776
-What about this Chinese food?
-Take it.

59
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:11,173
-I can't believe you said that.
-Hey, would you stop it already.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,989
So, what did she say?

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,070
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

62
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,691
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

63
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,474
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,680
-I have a good masseuse.
-No, she's really good.

65
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:26,149
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

66
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,679
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,215
It’s a real medical procedure.

68
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,824
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,088
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

70
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,458
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:43,104
-You don't pay for the massage?
-Not if you have a doctor's note.

72
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,898
So where do you get this note?

73
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,333
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

74
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,863
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

75
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,551
Right. Your friend Roy.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,575
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

77
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:57,151
I’ll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,393
And you don't have to pay?

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,982
We have 3:00 appointments.

80
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,250
-George and Elaine, right?
-Right.

81
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,620
Could you fill these out, please?

82
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:10,534
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

83
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,631
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,262
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

85
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,698
Yes.

86
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:27,558
But Raymond is a man.

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,207
That's right.

88
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,999
I can't get a massage from a man.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,461
-Why not?
-What, are you crazy?

90
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,934
I can't have a man touching me.

91
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,653
Switch with me.

92
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,253
I don't want the man either.

93
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,551
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

94
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:56,029
-He'd just be touching your back.
-He'd just be touching your back too.

95
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,950
-No, it could get sexual.
-I know.

96
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:02,374
That's the point. lf it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

97
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,253
-I wouldn't be comfortable.
-I would?

98
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,450
-What if something happens?
-Oh, what could happen?

99
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,127
What if it felt good?

100
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:17,538
-It’s supposed to feel good.
-I don't want it to feel good.

101
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:21,439
-Then why get the massage?
-Exactly.

102
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,814
George.

103
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:34,208
-Yes.
-I’m Raymond.

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,374
Hello.

105
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,673
Are you ready?

106
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,826
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

107
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,170
Really?

108
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,475
Used to be a flight attendant.

109
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:02,114
Oh, boy.

110
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:06,110
Why don't you open those pants.
It’s gonna be a lot easier that way.

111
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:22,624
-So, what do you do?
-What?

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,903
I said, what do you do?

113
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:26,622
I don't know.

114
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,726
-You don't know what you do?
-No.

115
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,620
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:35,751
-You're very tense.
-Coffee. Too much coffee.

117
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,530
Take off those pants.
I’ll work the hamstring.

118
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,064
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

119
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:46,084
-But you wrote that it was tender.
-I wrote. I wrote.

120
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,295
I’ll check it out.

121
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:51,334
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Take them off.

122
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,782
How did you hurt this?

123
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:24,414
I don't know.

124
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,823
-You don't know?
-No.

125
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,675
-But you just told me.
-Korea.

126
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,493
-You hurt it in Korea?
-What?

127
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:34,024
-The hamstring.
-Korea.

128
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,071
How?

129
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,793
Hamstring.

130
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,197
How did you hurt the hamstring?

131
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,987
Hotel.

132
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,784
How'd it go?

133
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,081
George?

134
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:59,072
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

135
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,899
What about Thursday?

136
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,658
And Friday?

137
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:06,685
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

138
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,677
What's with you?

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,746
A....

140
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:17,985
Yes. A....

141
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,281
A man gave me....

142
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,030
Yes. A man gave you....

143
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:27,168
A man gave me...

144
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,402
...a massage.

145
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,057
-So?
-So he...

146
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:36,007
...had his hands and....

147
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,631
He was....

148
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:43,335
-He was what?
-He-- He was...

149
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,672
...touching and rubbing.

150
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,135
That's a massage.

151
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,981
-Then I took my pants off.
-You took your pants off?

152
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,960
For my hamstring.

153
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:56,452
He got about...

154
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,624
...two inches from...

155
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,891
-...there.
-Really?

156
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,031
I think it moved.

157
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,936
-It moved?
-It may have moved. I don't know.

158
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,675
-I’m sure it didn't move.
-It moved!

159
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,688
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

160
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,599
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

161
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,965
-...shift to the other side.
-No, no.

162
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,609
It wasn't a shift. I’ve shifted.
This was a move.

163
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:29,287
-Okay. So what if it moved?
-That's the sign, the test.

164
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,936
lf a-- lf a man makes it move.

165
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,691
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

166
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:38,272
lf it moves as a result of contact.

167
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:42,150
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

168
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,615
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

169
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,412
-Hey.
-Hey.

170
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,584
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

171
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

172
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,511
Joe DiMaggio?

173
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,234
-In Dinky Doughnuts?
-Yes.

174
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,540
-Joe DiMaggio.
-No. I’m sorry.

175
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:05,317
lf Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

176
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,488
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

177
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,664
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

178
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,808
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

179
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,504
...because our knees might touch.

180
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:16,128
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

181
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:19,199
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

182
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,758
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

183
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,442
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

184
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,574
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

185
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,805
Look, I’m telling--

186
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,904
I’m telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

187
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,895
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

188
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,333
What about this doctor's note?

189
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:45,537
-Let's go see Roy.
-I never said I’d do that.

190
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,810
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

191
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:49,952
I’m not working. I can't afford that.

192
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,648
I don't know how I feel about it.

193
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,206
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

194
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,931
All right, all right.

195
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,072
A stall man, huh?

196
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,833
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

197
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:06,659
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

198
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:09,476
-He didn't say he can't.
-lf you feel funny about it at all.

199
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:11,169
-He doesn't feel funny.
-lf he does.

200
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,744
-Do you feel funny?
-Forget it.

201
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,353
-He didn't say anything.
-He feels funny.

202
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,463
-You don't have to do this.
-He knows that!

203
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,764
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

204
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,904
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

205
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,146
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:31,076
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

207
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,997
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

208
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:34,656
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,344
Do you like him?

210
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,144
What do you mean, like him?

211
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,768
-Do you like him?
-Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

212
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,263
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

213
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,113
-How come you don't like him?
-Why should l?

214
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,412
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing. Why?

215
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:51,879
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

216
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,501
-So you want the notes?
-You don't have to, really.

217
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,258
No, no. It’s okay.

218
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:59,590
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

219
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:02,052
George?

220
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:06,496
George.

221
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,432
What about the week after?

222
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,624
No appointments at all?

223
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,306
What?

224
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:20,959
Well, can l--?

225
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,839
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

226
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,362
Forget it.

227
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,359
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

228
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,530
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I’m cut off.

229
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:37,086
This woman is insane.

230
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,528
What's with you?

231
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:41,503
What?

232
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,769
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

233
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,105
Hey, you scrunched me.

234
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,729
I sat down here first.

235
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,126
Hey.

236
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:57,097
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

237
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,495
-Yeah.
-Joe DiMaggio?

238
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,625
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

239
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,201
...and I really watched him.

240
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,533
I studied his every move.

241
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:13,895
For example, he dunks.

242
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:17,289
-Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
-That's right.

243
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,711
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

244
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,662
Oh, he's a dunker.

245
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,439
-Why couldn't he be a dunker?
-Nothing diverts his attention.

246
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:29,351
Like, I’m sitting in there,
you know...

247
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:34,053
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

248
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:35,778
Like I’m sitting there, and l--

249
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:43,300
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

250
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:52,162
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

251
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,200
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

252
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,758
See, that's how he played baseball.

253
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,297
He dunks like he hits.

254
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,018
-So then what?
-Well...

255
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,968
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

256
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,918
...or they're gonna throw me out.

257
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:09,733
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

258
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:16,132
What happened to you?

259
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:20,873
These kids called me a Mary.

260
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,620
A what?

261
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:26,153
I was jumping over a puddle.

262
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:29,510
For some reason, I went like this:

263
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,646
And they called me a Mary.

264
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,809
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

265
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:39,327
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

266
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,564
Hey, George. What is this?

267
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,940
What is that?

268
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:46,245
No, really. What is that?

269
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:52,351
Hello.

270
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,344
Oh, hi, Roy.

271
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,815
What?

272
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,382
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,096
How did this happen?

274
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,313
What can I do?

275
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:05,920
I am so sorry.

276
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,462
Okay.

277
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,870
Bye.

278
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,351
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

279
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,098
-I told you.
-Told me what?

280
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,787
-I told you we shouldn't do it.
-I didn't say anything.

281
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:34,500
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

282
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,561
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

283
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,902
-Three notes?
-Yeah. You, me and George.

284
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,473
-You got me a note?
-Yeah.

285
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,195
-But I got my own note.
-You what?

286
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:47,678
-I got a note from my gynecologist.
-Why'd you do that?

287
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,665
-I didn't know you'd get me a note.
-Of course I’d get you a note.

288
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,800
-You didn't say anything.
-Neither did you.

289
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,872
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

290
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,376
How could you do that
to your friend?

291
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:04,613
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

292
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,942
Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,377
-Hi, Pam.
-Hello.

294
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,065
Hello.

295
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,333
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if--

296
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:22,433
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane--?

297
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:23,813
-Hi.
-Hi, Roy.

298
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,887
-How you doing?
-Come on back.

299
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:27,968
I have a patient, but she's under.

300
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:30,950
-I don't even know what to say.
-Me neither.

301
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:33,896
-I knew this would happen.
-Me too.

302
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:38,148
I mean, the whole thing, it's just....

303
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:40,704
-Tragic.
-Well, it's not tragic.

304
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,849
-No?
-No. It’s....

305
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,385
-Unsettling?
-Okay.

306
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,441
-I mean, what if they--?
-I hope you're both happy.

307
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,572
I’m not happy.

308
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,414
Me, neither.
I’ve never been happy.

309
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:02,656
I mean, I’m happy sometimes,
but not now.

310
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,899
In college, maybe.

311
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:08,610
-Those were fun times.
-Yeah, college was fun.

312
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:12,672
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

313
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:17,824
-Don't mind her.
-Oh, please. I love her.

314
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,612
I’ve just met her,
but I’m very impressed.

315
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,528
I’ve never had a problem
with these notes before.

316
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,184
What's gonna happen now?

317
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:28,737
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

318
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,433
What? The physical therapist? Why?

319
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,286
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

320
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:38,820
How you doing?

321
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,449
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

322
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:47,106
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

323
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,769
I’m sorry. She's not in.

324
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,492
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

325
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,088
I told you she's not here.

326
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:54,785
Look, you have to leave.

327
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:56,384
Wait a second. Don't you--?

328
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,693
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think--

329
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,287
-Please.
-But, you see....

330
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,110
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently--

331
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,893
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

332
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,655
Can't you listen to me?

333
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:10,502
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

334
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:11,972
Call the police.

335
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,403
The police.

336
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,879
What is the--?

337
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,569
Hi, George.

338
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,170
Hello.

339
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:22,656
Raymond?

340
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,097
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

341
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,688
It’s a slap on the wrist.

342
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,793
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

343
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:36,904
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

344
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,283
All of a sudden, I’ll be in the middle.

345
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:43,591
Of what?

346
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,318
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

347
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:50,727
I said, ''Get out of here.

348
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:52,898
What do you want?
You don't belong here.''

349
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,784
-What do they do?
-They talk back.

350
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:58,052
They go, ''Hey, George,
how's it going?''

351
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,608
I said, ''Get the hell out of here.''

352
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,753
Hey, it's the K-Man.

353
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,769
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

354
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:11,488
Oh, man.

355
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,877
Just came from Roy's.

356
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,218
I threw up from the gas.

357
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:25,478
-Did he say anything?
-No, no. He's fine.

358
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,090
Oh, my God. It’s....

359
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,593
-What?
-Joe DiMaggio.

360
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:34,282
Having a cup of coffee.

361
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,898
-And he's dunking.
-Yeah.

362
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,228
Look at him.

363
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,817
The Yankee Clipper.

364
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,264
Here.

365
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:47,426
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

366
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:54,375
Oh, please.

367
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,644
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

368
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,598
See? I told you.

369
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:08,105
What causes homophobia?

370
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:12,675
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

371
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,065
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

372
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,332
...we have weak sales resistance.

373
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,920
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

374
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,949
Men think, ''Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

375
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,278
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

376
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,679
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

377
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:36,804
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

378
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,624
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

379
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,303
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?'''
