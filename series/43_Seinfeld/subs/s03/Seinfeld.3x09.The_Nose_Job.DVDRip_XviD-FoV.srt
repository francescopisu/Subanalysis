1
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,239
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,662
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

3
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:14,629
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

4
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:18,503
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

5
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:21,891
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

6
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:25,407
''Look out, everybody,
I’m working with pills.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:27,648
Spread out, give me some room.''

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,788
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

9
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,704
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

10
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,772
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

11
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,355
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

12
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:43,491
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,752
''Yeah, I’d like to get this
prescription filled.''

14
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:51,266
''All right. You wait down there.

15
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:53,157
Only I’m allowed up here.''

16
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,673
-Where'd you meet her?
-I met her on an elevator.

17
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:04,555
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

18
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:07,468
-Impossible, right?
-You got less than 60 seconds.

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,997
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

20
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,001
-What got into you?
-I don't know. She was so beautiful...

21
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:14,891
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

22
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,870
-...just came out of my mouth.
-Wow. What did you say?

23
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,144
You know, I’m the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,724
-Can you believe I did that?
-What did she say?

25
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,896
What crop circles?

26
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,934
-Not a good sign.
-Not everybody knows...

27
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:37,098
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

28
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,305
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

29
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,224
You got something in your teeth.

30
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:43,406
-What?
-It's green.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,564
Oh, man, spinach. I’ve been
walking around like this all afternoon.

32
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,375
-You bump into anybody you knew?
-I had a job interview.

33
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,065
-How did it go?
-Take a guess.

34
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:57,261
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

35
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,599
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,809
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,590
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

38
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,512
Yeah. Right.

39
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,163
-What's the matter?
-No. Nothing.

40
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,917
-What?
-You won't think I’m a bad person?

41
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,707
Too late for that.

42
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:17,652
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

43
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,533
What is it?

44
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,131
Well....

45
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,531
Her nose is a little big.

46
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,475
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

47
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,966
I mean, big would even be okay.

48
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,721
It’s beyond big.

49
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,956
It’s a schnoz.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,670
I’m aware that my own
physical dimensions...

51
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,490
-...are a little short of perfection.
-A little.

52
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:43,892
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

53
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:48,115
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

54
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,581
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

55
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:54,676
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

56
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,802
I go to bed, I tell myself, ''Don't
think about the nose.'' I think about it.

57
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,904
I look at her, I see the nose.

58
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,177
Stop being so concerned with looks.

59
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,277
-Have you said anything to her?
-No. Could never do that.

60
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,483
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

61
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:22,744
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

62
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:26,293
And I really like her. I know that.

63
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,403
And I know one other thing:

64
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:30,933
I’m not getting past that nose.

65
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,136
All right, shut up. Here they come.

66
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:37,335
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

67
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:43,258
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

68
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:47,546
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

69
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:51,416
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

70
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:56,378
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

71
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,300
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

72
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,952
Won't the landlord know
I’m not the daughter?

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,509
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

74
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,958
-Are you coming with me?
-Yeah, I have to. I’m your fiancé.

75
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:11,930
Peter Von Nostrand.

76
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,137
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

77
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,020
What is so special
about this jacket?

78
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,390
-No, you don't wanna know.
-God....

79
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:23,515
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

80
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,406
What's that splotch on your hand?

81
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,418
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

82
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,896
I’m going back there tonight. I’m not
gonna pay another cover charge.

83
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,625
You didn't wash all day?

84
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:37,982
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

85
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,596
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

86
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:45,602
It’s amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

87
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,652
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

88
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,563
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

89
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:59,488
-Kramer!
-What? What?

90
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,727
How could you say
something like that?

91
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:04,163
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

92
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:07,109
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

93
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,988
-God, I’m so sorry, Audrey.
-Oh, it's okay.

94
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,413
-What did you have to say that for?
-I was just trying to help out.

95
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:18,372
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

96
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:22,305
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

97
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,856
But what would the world be like...

98
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,196
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

99
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,013
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

100
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,404
How long would a blind date last?

101
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,480
About 1 3 seconds, I think.

102
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:39,624
''Sorry, your rear end is too big.''
''Okay, your breath stinks.''

103
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,754
''See you later. No problem. Goodbye.''
''Okay, thank you very much.''

104
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:46,219
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

105
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,608
What are you thinking about?

106
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,239
Thinking? Nothing.

107
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,575
What could I possibly be thinking?

108
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:56,419
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

109
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:00,483
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

110
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,732
So how about that Kramer?

111
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,252
Yeah, how about him?

112
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:13,066
-The way he just says stuff.
-He sure does.

113
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,019
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,861
Yeah, he's quite a character.

115
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,936
So, what did you think?

116
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:22,668
About the pizza?

117
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,547
No. About the nose job.

118
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:29,322
Oh, the nose job. Yeah....

119
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,022
I don't know. I--

120
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:35,342
-Well, what did you think?
-Well, I’ve thought about it...

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,251
-...but I don't know.
-Yeah.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,339
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

123
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:47,215
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. lf you were so inclined.

124
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,817
-And again, I’m not suggesting.
-I know. They're good.

125
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,579
Peter Jennings had one.

126
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,819
-Really?
-Probably. They all do.

127
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,922
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

128
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,360
Of course,
I’m from Long Island, so....

129
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,504
It’s really nothing.
It’s like going to the dentist.

130
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:11,440
-I hate the dentist.
-It’s a cleaning.

131
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:14,862
So you really think I should do this.

132
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:19,501
lf it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

133
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,992
I will tell you this, though.

134
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,125
Unfortunately...

135
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,879
...we live in a very
superficial society.

136
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,760
I don't condone it...

137
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,064
...but it's a fact of life.

138
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,236
Well, maybe I should.

139
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,817
-What the hell?
-Now you talked her into a nose job?

140
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:43,983
-Me? I didn't say anything.
-You encouraged her to get one.

141
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,868
-I didn't encourage. No encourage.
-''Peter Jennings had one''?

142
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,786
It’s possible.

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,429
-You should accept her for who she is.
-No, George is right.

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,902
-I wanna get one.
-I think it's a mistake.

145
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,657
Me too. Really.

146
00:07:58,137 --> 00:07:59,992
Unless you'd really like one, then....

147
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,016
I’m going straight to hell.

148
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,380
No two ways about it.

149
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,196
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

150
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,713
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

151
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,467
We have time.

152
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,474
It’s exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

153
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:23,508
-It is exciting.
-Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

154
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:27,034
Please, please. Isabel?

155
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:30,425
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

156
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:34,232
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

157
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:37,910
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

158
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:41,590
It’s like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

159
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,864
And I’m letting him win.

160
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:50,871
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

161
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:54,486
-Then what?
-He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

162
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,100
She wants to be an actress.

163
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,014
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

164
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:06,875
Because I’m so addicted to the sex,
I’m helpless. I’ll do anything.

165
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:09,307
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

166
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,768
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

167
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,424
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

168
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,219
Please help me.

169
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,431
Help me.

170
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:24,348
I’m proud of you.

171
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:29,631
So I’m never gonna see her again.
I’m going cold turkey.

172
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,103
Good for you.

173
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:35,035
I’ll tell you, the sex....

174
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,872
I was like an animal.

175
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,115
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

176
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:46,427
It’s like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

177
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,793
It’s not like that at all.

178
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,164
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

179
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,314
Well, I don't. I’m guessing.

180
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:04,805
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

181
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:08,070
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

182
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:11,940
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

183
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,372
-lf you listened to your friend Elaine--
-George.

184
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,069
-Yeah?
-Enough.

185
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,638
-Right, enough.
-Are we ready?

186
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,588
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

187
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,173
-You sure you want us here for this?
-Yes.

188
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:25,799
-Shouldn't a doctor do it?
-No, he said I could do it.

189
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,683
Okay, here goes.

190
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:31,361
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It’s like watching a birth.

191
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,765
It looks good.

192
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,217
-Great job.
-You got butchered.

193
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,274
Head hurt.
No, I’m good. I’m fine.

194
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,394
Let's put him over here.

195
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,523
-Where are you going?
-To that doctor.

196
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,578
Wait, wait, wait! I’ll go with you.

197
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:08,808
How you feeling?

198
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,391
Too much salt in my diet.

199
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,531
-Can I get you anything?
-I’m good.

200
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:18,250
You sure? Anything.

201
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:21,731
No.

202
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,588
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

203
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,170
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

204
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:33,678
It’s, like, all dented.

205
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,939
Seems to be.

206
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,511
Well, I’m sure
they'll be able to fix it.

207
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:46,447
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

208
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,478
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches--

209
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,591
Shut up, George.

210
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,820
-Shut up?
-Yeah.

211
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:59,466
Interesting.

212
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,329
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

213
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,025
-I threw it out.
-You're lying.

214
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:08,366
-You've got it. I want the number.
-I threw it out.

215
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,537
-Give it to me.
-You said not to.

216
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,292
-You made me promise.
-I changed my mind. I want it.

217
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,347
You said no matter what,
I’m not to give it to you.

218
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,579
-I was lying. Give it to me.
-You told me not to.

219
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:20,562
-I want the number!
-All right! You want it? Yeah!

220
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,014
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

221
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,217
Look at what you've sunk to.

222
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:27,697
Look at what you've become.

223
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,890
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

224
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,090
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It’s turning my stomach.

225
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:38,549
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

226
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,979
It’s eating me up inside!

227
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:57,009
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

228
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,418
Yeah.

229
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,266
-You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
-Oh, I got it.

230
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:05,808
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

231
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,246
Yeah. Rough, rough.

232
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,504
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

233
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,267
What?

234
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:16,183
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

235
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,468
-We did?
-We talked about going to Hawaii.

236
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,026
-Hawaii?
-Anyway, I think it would be great...

237
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,682
...to get away after all this.

238
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:27,705
Well, you--

239
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,218
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

240
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,063
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

241
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:38,228
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

242
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,436
...wood and lava.

243
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:42,291
It could be dangerous.

244
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,908
-I never heard that.
-Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so....

245
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,692
We could go to the Caribbean.

246
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,595
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

247
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,781
I get those FAA reports directly.

248
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:57,821
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so....

249
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,024
Big investigation in the....

250
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:05,078
What's the word there?
Offing. It’s in the offing.

251
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:10,743
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

252
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,535
-George?
-Yeah.

253
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,928
I don't think this is working.

254
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:21,913
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

255
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:27,261
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

256
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,464
I’m Nelson.

257
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:34,299
-That's not the line, Jerry.
-All right, all right, I’m sorry.

258
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:39,580
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

259
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:45,279
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

260
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,466
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

261
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,353
Well, you just need to relax.

262
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,781
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

263
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:59,389
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

264
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:02,435
<i>Uh-oh. My organs</i>
<i>are playing chess again.</i>

265
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:06,426
I’m getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

266
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:09,980
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

267
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,498
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

268
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,099
I can't take her anymore.

269
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,783
-I hate reading her little acting scenes.
-Oh, so what?

270
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,641
So you read from a little play.

271
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:24,155
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

272
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:25,920
Give me one hour.

273
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,157
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

274
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,694
What about tomorrow morning?

275
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:34,271
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

276
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,869
No, you don't care.

277
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,488
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

278
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:42,078
-You disgust me.
-Oh, go read a book.

279
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:45,118
Enough chatter. Let's play.

280
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,809
I’m only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

281
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:52,230
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

282
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,887
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,709
Here.

284
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,360
-What do I need this for?
-Because we're engaged.

285
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,074
We're engaged?

286
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,125
Kramer, this is too big.

287
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,808
-It’s my mom's.
-Hello!

288
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:13,249
Oh, hi. I’m Wanda Pepper.
I’m Albert Pepper's daughter.

289
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,907
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

290
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,313
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,777
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

292
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,150
Yes. Yes, I am.

293
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:26,406
I’ve read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

294
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,741
-Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
-Tell me...

295
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,033
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an imposter?

296
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:34,605
-My contention?
-Your contention.

297
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,766
-Well, yes, that's my contention.
-I heard him contend that.

298
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:39,949
It’s too bad about your father.

299
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,689
-It was a frame-up.
-A fine man. He spoke often of you.

300
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:46,092
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

301
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:50,091
-We're all proud of the work I’m doing.
-Yes, she does fine work.

302
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:54,598
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

303
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:57,321
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

304
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:59,561
-The closet's this way.
-How kind of you.

305
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,759
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

306
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:04,521
Yes.

307
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:11,111
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

308
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,992
Nelson, don't you see?

309
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,581
You are a part of me.

310
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,981
And l....

311
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,083
I am a part of you.

312
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,201
She's killing me.

313
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,850
That's your move?

314
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,663
-Yeah.
-Well, that's trouble, my friend.

315
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,584
That's big trouble.

316
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,218
Checkmate.

317
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,366
Getting weak. Losing power.

318
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:48,241
You haven't seen the last of me.
I’ll be back.

319
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:52,337
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

320
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,082
Little punk.

321
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:01,747
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

322
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,307
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

323
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:13,174
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

324
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:16,748
My father? Really? I had no idea.

325
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,164
They're crazy about him.

326
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:21,645
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

327
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,950
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

328
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,509
What was her name again?

329
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:30,165
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

330
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,525
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

331
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,829
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

332
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,384
-...drunken stumblebum.
-You don't say.

333
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:41,784
-I found it!
-She walked around here half-naked...

334
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:45,111
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

335
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:49,170
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopedic hose up to her knees...

336
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,064
...screaming down the hall:

337
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,977
''Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

338
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:57,753
And bring back that box of Danish!''

339
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,847
-So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
-Yeah, and I yelled out:

340
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,348
''Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him.''

341
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,413
-So I assume the jig was up.
-Yeah, pretty much.

342
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,273
But look.

343
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,027
Yes.

344
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:15,037
-Hi. Here are your keys.
-Hi. Thank you.

345
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,108
-Hello.
-Audrey.

346
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,271
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

347
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,984
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

348
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,035
So will I see you later tonight?

349
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,526
Not sure.

350
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,912
Well, I’ll check you guys out later.

351
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,479
-Ready?
-I didn't wash.

352
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,496
Neither did l.

353
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,376
We're off to the reggae lounge.

354
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,999
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

355
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,920
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

356
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:59,611
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

357
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,146
-Who would have thought, she's--?
-Elaine...

358
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:04,252
...shut up.

359
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,609
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

360
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:11,706
-Rhinoplasty.
-Rhinoplasty.

361
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,519
Rhino. Okay?

362
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,339
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

363
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,444
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

364
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,963
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

365
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,239
...on top of everything else?

366
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,835
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

367
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,228
''We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

368
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,513
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

369
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,941
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we--

370
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:46,525
The technical term....''
