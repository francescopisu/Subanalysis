1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,950
Do you know what this is all about?
Know why we're here?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,450
To be out. This is out.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,730
Out is one of the single most
enjoyable experiences of life.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,910
Know how people talk about
"We should go out"?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,000
This is what they're talking about.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,880
This whole thing. We're all out now.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,340
No one is home.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,050
Not one person here is home.
We're all out.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,380
There are people trying to find us.
They don't know where we are.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,890
"Did you re...? I can't find him.
Where did he go?

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,430
He didn't tell me where he was going.
He must have gone out."

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,290
You wanna go out. You get ready,
you pick out the clothes, right?

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,270
You take the shower, get all ready...

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,020
...get the cash, get your friends,
the car, the spot, the reservation.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,900
Then you stand around.
What do you do?

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,090
You go, "We gotta be getting back."

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,430
Once you're out,
you wanna get back.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,660
You wanna go to sleep, you wanna
get up, wanna go out again tomorrow.

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,120
Wherever you are in life...

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,200
...it's my feeling, you've gotta go.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
See, to me, that button's
in the worst possible spot.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,130
The second button literally
makes or breaks the shirt.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,010
Look at it. It's too high.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,030
It's in no man's land. You look like
you live with your mother.

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,600
Are you through?

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,580
You do, of course,
try on when you buy.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,560
Yes, it was purple. I liked it.

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,850
I don't actually recall
considering the buttons.

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,730
Oh, you don't recall.

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,760
No, not at this time.

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,570
Senator, I'd like to know what
you knew and when you knew it.

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,280
Mr. Seinfeld, Mr. Costanza.

33
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,740
Are you sure this is decaf?

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,410
Where's the orange indicator?

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,330
It's missing.
I have to do it in my head.

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,620
Decaf left, regular right.

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,330
Decaf left, regular right.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,310
It's very challenging work.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,800
Can you relax? It's a cup of coffee.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,300
- Claire's a professional waitress.
- Trust me, George.

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,910
No one has any interest
in seeing you on caffeine.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,910
How come you're not doing
the second show tomorrow?

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,520
Well, there's this woman
who might be coming in.

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,920
Wait a second. Wait a second.

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,790
What coming in?
What woman's coming in?

46
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,400
I told you about Laura,
the girl I met in Michigan.

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,690
- You didn't.
- I thought I told you about her.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,570
Yeah. She teaches political science...

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,390
...I met her the night I did
the show in Lansing.

50
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,890
- There's no milk in here.
- Wait.

51
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,080
What is she...
What is she like?

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,210
Oh, she's really great.
She's got a real warmth about her.

53
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,130
And she's really bright
and really pretty.

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,050
And the conversation,
though, I mean, it was...

55
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,240
Talking with her was like
talking with you...

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,420
...but, you know,
obviously much better.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,340
So, you know, what happened?

58
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,740
Well, nothing happened.
But it was great.

59
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,930
Nothing happened, but it was...
This is great.

60
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,390
- Yeah.
- So, you know...

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,580
...she called and said
she wants to go out?

62
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,400
God bless. You devil, you.

63
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,270
Yeah. Well, not exactly.

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,300
I mean, she said...
She called this morning and said...

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,110
...she had to come in for a seminar,
maybe we'd get together.

66
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,450
"Had to"?

67
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,530
- "Had to come in"?
- Yeah, but...

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,100
- "Had to come in"?
- Yeah, but...

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
"And maybe we'll get together"?

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,230
"Had to" and "maybe"?

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,520
- Yeah.
- No, no.

72
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,920
I hate to tell you this.
You're not gonna see her.

73
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,320
What? Are you serious?
Why did she call?

74
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,710
What do I know?
Maybe she wanted to be polite.

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,700
To be polite?

76
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,890
- You are insane.
- All right.

77
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,390
I didn't want to tell you.
Wanna know why she called?

78
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,260
You're a backup.

79
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,500
You're a second line,
a "just in case"...

80
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,940
...a B plan, a contingency.

81
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,130
Oh, I get it. This is about the button.

82
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,670
Claire. Claire, you're a woman, right?

83
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,070
What gave it away, George?

84
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,740
I'd like to ask you...

85
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,870
Ask you to analyze a hypothetical
phone call, you know...

86
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,060
...from a female point of view.
- Oh, come on.

87
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,770
What are you asking her?
Now, how's she gonna know?

88
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,690
Now, a woman calls me, right?

89
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,400
She says she has to...

90
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,420
...come to New York on business...
- You're beautiful.

91
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,090
And maybe...

92
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,860
...she'll see me when she gets in.

93
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,160
Does this woman intend
to spend time with me?

94
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,660
I'd have to say no.

95
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,980
So why did she call?

96
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,060
- Be polite.
- To be polite.

97
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,560
- I rest my case.
- Good, good. Did you have fun?

98
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,280
You have no idea what you're
talking about. Come with me.

99
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,360
I gotta go get my stuff
out of the dryer.

100
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,010
- I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
- Oh, come on. Be a "come-with" guy.

101
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,470
Come on. I'm tired.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,180
Don't worry.
I gave him a little caffeine.

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,620
- He'll perk up.
- Right. I knew I felt something.

104
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,820
Jerry, I have to tell you something.

105
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,510
This is the dullest moment
I've ever experienced.

106
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,970
Oh, look at this guy.

107
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,100
Look, he's got everything.
He's got detergents, sprays...

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,850
...fabric softener.
This is not his first load.

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,710
I need a break, Jerry.
I gotta get out of the city.

110
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,260
- I feel so cramped...
- You didn't hear how she sounded.

111
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,240
- What?
- Laura.

112
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,890
I can't believe...
We already discussed this.

113
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Yeah, but how could you
be so sure?

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,830
Because it's signals, Jerry.
It's signals. Don't you...?

115
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,570
All right. Did she even ask you what
you were doing tomorrow night...

116
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,130
...if you were busy?
- No.

117
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,260
She calls you today,
she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow?

118
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,340
- What is that? It's Saturday night.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,950
What is that? It's ridiculous.

120
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,240
You don't even know
what hotel she's staying at.

121
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,850
You can't call her.
That's a signal, Jerry.

122
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,350
That's a signal. Signal.

123
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,040
- Maybe you're right.
- Maybe I'm right?

124
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,030
Of course I'm right.

125
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,420
This is insane.

126
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,820
You know, I don't even know
where she's staying.

127
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,280
She's not gonna call me.

128
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,620
- This is unbelievable.
- I know, I know. It's tough.

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,330
Listen, your stuff
has to be done by now.

130
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,100
Why don't you just see if it's dry.

131
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,230
No, no, no.
Don't interrupt the cycle.

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,780
The machine is working. It knows
what it's doing. Just let it finish.

133
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,900
- You're gonna overdry it.
- You can't overdry.

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,510
- Why not?
- Same reason you can't overwet.

135
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,850
You see, once something
is wet, it's wet.

136
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,140
Same thing with death.

137
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,540
Like, once you die,
you're dead. Right?

138
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,040
Let's say you drop dead
and I shoot you.

139
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,650
You're not gonna die again.
You're already dead.

140
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,570
You can't "overdie," you can't overdry.

141
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,150
Any questions?

142
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,240
How could she not tell me
where she was staying?

143
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,480
Look at that. They're done.
Look at that.

144
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,380
Laundry day is the only
exciting day...

145
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,950
...in the life of clothes.

146
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,550
It is. No, think about it.
The washing machine...

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,370
...is the nightclub of clothes.

148
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,770
You know, it's dark,
there's bubbles happening...

149
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,160
...they're all kind of
dancing around in there.

150
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,400
A shirt grabs the underwear.
"Come on, babe. Let's go."

151
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,940
You come by, open up the lid
and they all...

152
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,160
Socks are the most
amazing article of clothing.

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,550
They hate their lives.
They're with stinky feet...

154
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,430
...the boring drawers.

155
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,980
The dryer is their only chance
to escape and they all know it.

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,630
They do escape from the dryer.
They plan it in the hamper...

157
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,750
...the night before.
"Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm going.

158
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,510
You wait here."

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,890
The dryer door swings open, the sock
is waiting up against the side wall.

160
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,720
He hopes you don't see him,
then he goes down the road.

161
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,100
They get buttons sewn on their face,
join a puppet show.

162
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,540
So they're showing me
on television...

163
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,360
...the detergents
getting out bloodstains.

164
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,320
Is this a violent image to anybody?
Bloodstains?

165
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,240
Come on. You got a T-shirt
with bloodstains all over it...

166
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,580
...maybe laundry isn't your
biggest problem right now.

167
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Maybe you ought to get the harpoon
out of your chest first.

168
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,210
If you know what happened in the Met
game, don't tell me. I taped it. Hello.

169
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,860
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

170
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,370
Yeah. No...

171
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
- Yeah.
- You up?

172
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,020
Yeah.

173
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
People do move.

174
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,440
Have you ever seen the big trucks
out on the street?

175
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,110
Yeah, no problem.

176
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,800
- Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
- Oh, what are you doing?

177
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,930
Kessler, it's a tape.
I taped the game.

178
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,430
It's 1:00 in the morning.

179
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,080
I avoided human contact
all night to watch this.

180
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey, I'm sorry.
You know, I thought you knew.

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,480
You got any meat?

182
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,190
Meat?

183
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,150
I don't know. Go hunt.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,700
Well, what happened in the game,
anyway?

185
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,370
What happened?

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,560
Well, they stunk!
That's what happened.

187
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,490
You know I almost wound up
going to that game?

188
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,340
You almost went to the game. You
haven't left the building in 10 years.

189
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,430
Yeah.

190
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,550
- You done with this?
- No.

191
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,000
- When you're done, let me know.
- Yeah, yeah.

192
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,190
You can have it tomorrow.

193
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,150
I thought I wasn't allowed
to be in here this weekend.

194
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,800
No, it's okay now.
That girl's not coming.

195
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,990
I misread the whole thing.

196
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,220
You want me to talk to her?

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,330
I don't think so.

198
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,250
No, I can be very persuasive.

199
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,380
You know that I was
almost a lawyer?

200
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,670
That close, huh?

201
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,860
You better believe it.

202
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,080
Hello.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
Oh, hi, Laura.

204
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,770
- Oh, give me it. Let me talk.
- No. What's up?

205
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,000
- Well, let me talk to her.
- I'm always up at this hour.

206
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,610
How are you? Great.

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,210
Sure.

208
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,400
What time does the plane get in?

209
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,630
- I'll get my friend George to take me.
- Now slide!

210
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,350
Out. Do you believe that?

211
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,540
It's just my neighbor.

212
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,870
Yeah, I got it. 10: 15.

213
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,690
No, don't be silly.
Go ahead and ask.

214
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah, sure.

215
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,190
Okay, great. No, no.
It's no trouble at all.

216
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

217
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,370
Great. Bye.

218
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,450
I don't believe it.

219
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,790
That was her.
She wants to stay here.

220
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,920
If my father moved this,
he'd have a cigarette...

221
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,640
...in his mouth the whole way.
"Have you got your end?

222
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,450
Your end's got to come down first.
Easy, now. Drop it down.

223
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,950
Drop it down.
Your end's gotta come down."

224
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,770
You know, I can't believe you're
bringing in an extra bed...

225
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,960
...for a woman that wants
to sleep with you.

226
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,460
Why don't you bring in
an extra guy too.

227
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,800
Look, it's a very awkward situation.

228
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,990
- I don't wanna be presumptuous.
- All right.

229
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,860
One more time. One more time.

230
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,930
What was the exact phrasing
of the request?

231
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,480
All right. She said she couldn't
find a decent hotel room.

232
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,190
- A decent hotel room.
- Yeah, a decent hotel room.

233
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,210
Would it be terribly inconvenient
if she stayed at my place?

234
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,820
You can't be serious.

235
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,610
This is New York City. There must
be 11 million decent hotel rooms.

236
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,700
What do you need, a flag?

237
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,470
This is the signal, Jerry.

238
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,810
- This is the signal.
- This is the signal.

239
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,210
Thank you, Mr. Signal.
Where were you yesterday?

240
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,290
I think I was affected
by the caffeine.

241
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,250
Good dog. Good dog. All right.

242
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,960
Hey, he really likes you, George.

243
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,940
Well, that's flattering.

244
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,910
He's getting a drink of water.

245
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,890
- Is this for that girl?
- Yeah.

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,440
- Why even give her an option?
- This is a person I like.

247
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,940
It's not how to score
on spring break.

248
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,760
Can we go? I'm double-parked.
I'm gonna get a ticket.

249
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,990
Yeah, okay. Wait a second.
I forgot to clean the bathroom.

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,450
So what? That's good.

251
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,580
- How could that be good?
- Because filth is good.

252
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,290
What do you think, rock stars
have sponges and ammonia...

253
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,750
...lying around the bathroom?

254
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,460
You think they have a woman
coming over, "I gotta tidy up"?

255
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,060
In these matters, you never do
what instincts tell you.

256
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,050
Always, always do the opposite.

257
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,340
- This is how you operate?
- Yeah, I wish.

258
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,760
- Let me just wipe the sink.
- Why even give her an option for?

259
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,890
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

260
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,350
How's the real estate business?

261
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,460
It's not bad. It's coming along.

262
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,900
Why, did you need something?

263
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,510
You handle any of that commercial...

264
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,800
...real estate that...?

265
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,450
Well, I might be getting into that.

266
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,420
- You keep me posted.
- I'm aware of you. All right, let's go.

267
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,020
Let's go. You're on-stage
in 25 minutes.

268
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,030
The dating world is not a fun world.

269
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,840
It's a pressure world.

270
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,550
It's a world of tension,
it's a world of pain.

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,790
If a woman comes over to my house,
I gotta get that bathroom ready...

272
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,290
...because she needs things.
I don't know what.

273
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,690
I know I don't have it, I know that.

274
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,190
You know what they need?
Women need cotton balls.

275
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,840
This is one... Always been one of
the most amazing things to me.

276
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,340
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.

277
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,950
What is the story?
I've never had one...

278
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,350
...I never bought one,
I never needed one.

279
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,060
I've never been in a situation
where I thought to myself:

280
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,140
"I could use a cotton ball right now.

281
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,000
I could certainly
get out of this mess."

282
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,610
Women need them.
And they don't need one or two.

283
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,320
They need thousands of them.
They need bags.

284
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,650
They're like peat moss bags.
Have you ever seen these giant bags?

285
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,110
They're huge...

286
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,550
...and two days later, they're out.
They're gone. The bag is empty.

287
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,580
Where are the cotton balls, ladies?
What are you doing with them?

288
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,600
The only time I ever see them
is in the bottom of wastebaskets.

289
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,560
Two or three look like they've been
through some horrible experience.

290
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,150
Tortured, interrogated,
I don't know what happened to them.

291
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,110
I once went out with a girl, she left
a little bag of cotton balls at my house.

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,970
I didn't know what to do. I put them
on the floor like little tumbleweeds.

293
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,160
I thought cockroaches
would see it...

294
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,460
...figure, "This is a dead town.
Let's move on."

295
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,270
The dating world
is a world of pressure.

296
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,550
Let's face it, a date is a job interview
that lasts all night.

297
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,050
The difference between
a date and job interview is...

298
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,010
...not many interviews is there a
chance you'll end up naked at the end.

299
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,450
You know, " Bill, the boss thinks
you're the man for the position...

300
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,680
...strip down and meet the people
you'll be working with."

301
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,290
Wouldn't it be great if you could ask
a woman what she's thinking?

302
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,940
What a world it would be if you could
just ask a woman what she's thinking.

303
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,180
You know, instead I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.

304
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,470
The whole thing's
a murder investigation.

305
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,910
Listen, don't get worked up.
You're gonna know the whole story...

306
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,000
...the minute she steps off.
- Really, how?

307
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,870
It's all in the greeting. All right.

308
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,000
If she puts the bags down before
she greets you, that's a good sign.

309
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,920
- Anything in the lip area is good.
- Lip area.

310
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,630
- A hug, definitely good.
- Hug is definitely good.

311
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,340
What if it's one of those hugs
where the shoulders touch...

312
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,640
...the hips are eight feet apart?
- Brutal.

313
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,560
- You know how they do that?
- Also, a shake is bad.

314
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,750
Shake is bad. But what if
it's the two-hander?

315
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,560
Hand on bottom, hand on top.
The warm look in the eyes.

316
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,920
- Hand sandwich?
- Right.

317
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,940
It's open to interpretation.
So much depends on the layering...

318
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,920
...the quality of the wetness
in the eyes...

319
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,840
- Guess who.
- Hey, hey. He...

320
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,970
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

321
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,390
- It's good to see you.
- Hi.

322
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,000
- This is my friend George.
- Oh, hi.

323
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,460
- How are you?
- This is Laura.

324
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,790
- Sure, Laura, sure.
- I can't believe you're here.

325
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,530
- Get the bags.
- Yeah, sure, the bags.

326
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,410
- Here, Laura. I'm sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

327
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,010
That was an interesting greeting.
Notice that, George?

328
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,100
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting.

329
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,180
That wasn't in the manual.

330
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,940
So...

331
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,600
...what do you think?

332
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,570
This place isn't so bad.

333
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,800
Yeah, it kind of motivates me
to work on the road.

334
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,450
So make yourself at home.

335
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,090
So can I get you anything?

336
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,970
Bread, water...

337
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,470
...salad dressing?

338
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,600
Actually, do you have any wine?

339
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,150
Yeah, I think I do.

340
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,570
Do you mind if I turn this down?

341
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,430
No. Yeah, go...
Go right ahead. Yeah.

342
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,370
Jerry, I was wondering...

343
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,980
...would it be possible,
and if it's not, fine...

344
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,580
...for me to stay here
tomorrow night too?

345
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,170
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why don't you stay.

346
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,840
Yeah.

347
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,590
What is your schedule
for tomorrow?

348
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,050
Are you doing anything?

349
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,510
No, I'd love to do something.

350
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,330
I have my seminar in the morning,
but after I'm wide open.

351
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,200
Really? What would you like to do?

352
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,770
Well...

353
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,100
...I know this sounds touristy,
but I'd love to go on one of those...

354
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,810
...five-hour boat rides
around Manhattan.

355
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,730
Yeah, we could do that.

356
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,280
Why not? Why not?

357
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm just... I'm really glad you're here.

358
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,250
Hello.

359
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,750
Yes.

360
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,250
Yes, she is. Hold on.

361
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,340
It's for you.

362
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,670
Hello?

363
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,030
Hi.

364
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,260
No, no. It was great, right on time.

365
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,870
No, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.

366
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,850
Yes. Yes, it's fine.

367
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,870
No, we're going on a boat ride.

368
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,630
Don't be silly.

369
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,170
I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

370
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,150
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

371
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,030
Okay. Bye.

372
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,640
Never get engaged.

373
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,810
You're engaged?

374
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,560
You know, you really have no idea
what it's like until you do it.

375
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm on this emotional roller coaster.

376
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,520
You're engaged?

377
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,340
You know, I can't believe it
myself sometimes.

378
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,050
You have to start thinking
in terms of "we."

379
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,970
- It's a very stressful situation.
- You're engaged.

380
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,680
- Yeah, he's a great guy.
- Yeah.

381
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,870
You'd really like him.

382
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,310
- I can't wait to get on that boat.
- Me too.

383
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,900
I swear, I have absolutely no idea
what women are thinking.

384
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,960
I don't get it, okay?
I admit, I'm not getting the signals.

385
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,740
I am not getting it.

386
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,120
Women, they're so subtle. Their little...
Everything they do is subtle.

387
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,290
Men are not subtle. We are obvious.

388
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,790
Women know what men want,
men know what men want.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,330
What do we want?
We want women. That's it.

390
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,860
It's the only thing we know for sure.
It really is.

391
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,630
We want women.
How do we get them?

392
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,510
We don't know about that.
We don't know.

393
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,800
The next step after that,
we have no idea.

394
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,760
This is why you see men honking car
horns, yelling from construction sites.

395
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,480
These are the best ideas
we've had so far.

396
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,310
The car horn honk.
Is that the beauty?

397
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,710
Have you seen men doing this?

398
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,900
What is this? The man is in the car.

399
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,090
The woman walks by
the front of the car.

400
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,660
He honks the...

401
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,660
This man is out of ideas.

402
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,160
How does the...?

403
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,790
I don't think she likes me.

404
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,960
The amazing thing is that we still
get women, don't we?

405
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,840
I mean, men are with women.

406
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,610
You see men with women.

407
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,850
How are men getting women?
Many people wonder.

408
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,350
Let me tell you a little bit
about our organization.

409
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,190
Wherever women are, we have a man
working on the situation right now.

410
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,730
Now, he may not be our best man...

411
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,170
...okay, we have a lot of areas
to cover...

412
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,240
...but someone from our staff
is on the scene.

413
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,910
That's why men get frustrated...

414
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,990
...when we see women
reading articles...

415
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,600
...like "Where to Meet Men."

416
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,730
We're here. We are everywhere.

417
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,860
We're honking our horns
to serve you better.
