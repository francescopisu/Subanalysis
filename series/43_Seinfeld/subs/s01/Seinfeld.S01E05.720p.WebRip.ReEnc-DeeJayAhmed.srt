1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,120
Went to dinner the other night,
check came at the end of the meal.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,700
Never liked the
"check at the end of the meal" system.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Money's a different thing
before you eat.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,600
Before you eat, money has no value.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,270
You don't care
when you're hungry.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,550
You sit down in a restaurant, you're
the ruler of an empire. " More drinks!

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,780
Appetizers! Quickly, quickly.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,160
It will be the greatest
meal of our lives."

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,540
Then after the meal, you know,
you got the pants open...

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,420
...you got the napkins destroyed...

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,340
...cigarette butt
in the mashed potatoes.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,730
Then the check comes at that moment.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,240
People are always upset, you know?

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,680
They're mystified by the check.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,760
"What is this?

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,580
How could this be?"

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,060
They start passing it around the table,
"Does this look right to you?

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,860
We're not hungry now.
Why are we buying all this food?"

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,580
I think Superman probably has
a very good sense of humour.

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,500
I never heard him say anything funny.

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,160
It's common sense.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,670
He's got super strength, super speed.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,540
I'm sure he's got super humour.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,630
You would think that, but...

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,970
...either you're born with humour
or you're not. It's not gonna change.

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,050
Even if you go
from the red sun of Krypton...

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,450
...all the way to the yellow sun
of the Earth.

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,410
Why? Why would that one area
of his mind...

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,960
...not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,150
I don't know. But he ain't funny.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,070
Hi.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,050
I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,030
No problem.

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,320
I dropped a grape.

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,140
- What?
- I dropped a grape in the kitchen...

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,810
...and it disappeared.

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,980
I couldn't find it. I was... I was
literally on my knees for 10 minutes...

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,060
...looking for this stupid grape.

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,170
I have no idea where it went.

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,620
Were you crying?
I mean, it's just a grape.

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,970
You'll find it.

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,790
No. I'm just getting over
an allergy attack.

43
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,290
- This guy I'm going out with...
- Robert.

44
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,520
Robert. Yes. Thank you.

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,110
He has two cats,
and I'm allergic to them.

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,120
You know, I finally meet
a normal man...

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
...and I can't even go
into his apartment.

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,910
Of course, my apartment
is The Actors' Studio...

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,770
...so we can't go there. It's really
causing a lot of problems, you know?

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,790
He won't even go away for
the weekend because of these cats.

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,650
Guys with cats... I don't know.

52
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,950
I been thinking of asking
this girl I'm seeing...

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,610
Vanessa?

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,800
Vanessa. Thank you.

55
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,620
I been thinking about asking her
to go away a couple days.

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,080
Oh, no. No, no.

57
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,100
I'd have to advise against that.

58
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,080
What do you know this woman,
a month?

59
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,320
You're gonna be with her 72 hours,
that's a dating decathlon.

60
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,280
Why don't you take her to that place
in Vermont I was telling you about?

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,260
That really charming place with the...

62
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,600
...with the separate faucets
for the hot and cold.

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,160
She'll love it.

64
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,330
That's exquisite.
Listen, if it's not too much trouble...

65
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,940
...could you pass me
that paper over there?

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,920
Just the business section.

67
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,990
You better find that grape before
it mutates into another life form.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,490
There was once a mutant grape...

69
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,930
...that terrorized an entire town
in the Texas panhandle.

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,060
They brought in the Army.
Nobody could stop it.

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,190
Apparently, it had a pit of steel.

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,570
Up again. This is incredible.

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,070
- I'm getting it.
- You're getting what?

74
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,570
- A stock.
- What stock?

75
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,390
- You ever meet my friend Simons?
- Maybe.

76
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
This guy Wilkenson made a fortune
in the stock market.

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,230
Now he's got some new thing, there
was supposed to be a big merger.

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,420
I wasn't even supposed
to say anything.

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,230
- You should think about this.
- How high is it supposed to go?

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,050
I don't know. But Simons said
if I wanted to get involved...

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,970
...Wilkenson would tell me
the exact right minute to sell.

82
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,370
- You wanna do it?
- Boy, I don't know.

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,830
I don't have any money.

84
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,290
What kind of company is it?

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,830
It's called Centrax. They got
some new kind of technique...

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,810
...for televising opera.

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,590
Televising opera?

88
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,360
Some sort of electronic thingy.

89
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,920
How much are you gonna invest?

90
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,470
Five thousand. Ten... Ten thousand.

91
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,760
Five thousand.

92
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,580
- Boy.
- Come on!

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,870
Wilkenson's got millions
invested in this stock.

94
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,580
It's gone up three points
since I've been watching it.

95
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,020
- What if I lose it?
- Come on! Go for 2500.

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,010
We'll do it together.
Come on, come on.

97
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,880
We're in it together.

98
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,110
- All right, 2500.
- That's it.

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,100
Yeah, can I take your order?

100
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,970
Check to the raiser.

101
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,850
My bet? All right.

102
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll open with the tuna sandwich.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,520
- Tuna?
- Oh, the dolphin thing?

104
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,340
They're dying in the nets.

105
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,570
You know, the whole concept of lunch
is based on tuna.

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,740
Jerry, can't you incorporate one
unselfish act in your daily routine?

107
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,870
Hey, when I'm driving, I let people
in ahead of me all the time.

108
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,960
I'm always waving everybody in.

109
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,290
"Go ahead. Go ahead."

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,360
All right, all right.
I'll have the chicken salad.

111
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,130
And I'm gonna have...

112
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,990
...an English muffin with margarine
on the side, and a cup of coffee.

113
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,350
Okay, what about you?

114
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,010
I'll have the tuna.

115
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,770
I have to say,
those people talking behind us...

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,650
...really ruined that movie for me.

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,840
Why didn't you do something?

118
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,820
What do you want me to do?

119
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,640
I gave the guy the half-turn.

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,700
Then I gave him the full turn
with the eye roll.

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
I mean, beyond that,
I'm risking a punch in the mouth.

122
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,530
Excuse me.
Do you have these in the puffs?

123
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,650
No puffs. Just flakes.

124
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,410
Have you thought any more
about that trip?

125
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,600
Yeah. I've been thinking about it.

126
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,200
You know, my friend told me
about this place in Vermont.

127
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,370
I don't know. I just worry about
trips like this. It's a lot of pressure.

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,560
It's great.
It speeds up the intimacy level.

129
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,590
It's like putting the relationship
in a time compressor.

130
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,990
Where we would be
six months from now...

131
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,760
...we accomplish in three days.

132
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,410
So you want to move our relationship
into phase two.

133
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,750
Exactly. I love phase two.

134
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,020
Extra toothbrushes,
increased phone call frequency...

135
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,940
...walking around naked.

136
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,260
You know, the presents get a lot better
in phase two.

137
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,030
Really?

138
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,220
Can we go fishing up there?

139
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,080
We can fish. What,
blues, carp, marlin?

140
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,690
- Marlin in Vermont?
- Oh.

141
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,090
Big fighting marlin.

142
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,430
Jerry, the stock is the same
as when you checked earlier.

143
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,970
There are no changes after the market
closes, the stock is still down.

144
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,620
I know, but this is a different paper.
I thought maybe they have different...

145
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,080
...sources.

146
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,060
Is that my paper?

147
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,620
Bad news, my friend.

148
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,020
- What, what news?
- Centrax.

149
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,100
Oh, come on. It's down again?

150
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,440
- Two and a half points.
- Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that.

151
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,910
That's four and a half points
in three days.

152
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,620
- That's almost half my money.
- Hey, I told you.

153
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,850
- Yeah, you told me.
- It's all manipulated with junk bonds.

154
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,140
You can't win.

155
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,840
There's one thing I don't understand.

156
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,400
Why does it please you?

157
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,960
George Costanza, please.

158
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm just telling you
to get rid of that stock now!

159
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,550
George, what's going on?

160
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
Sell them! Just say, "I'm selling!"

161
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,240
Well, where is the guy?

162
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,830
Nothing?
Almost half my money's gone.

163
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,810
Well, call me right back.

164
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,820
Nobody can reach Wilkenson, he
hasn't been in his office in three days.

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,220
I can't believe you put your money
in that Centrax.

166
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,240
You could have invested
in my roll-out tie dispenser.

167
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,000
The roll-out tie dispenser.

168
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,080
- What was that?
- Okay. You're in a restaurant.

169
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,170
You got a very big meeting
coming up.

170
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,770
- Okay.
- "Oh, man!"

171
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,750
You got mustard on your tie.

172
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,630
- Oh, no.
- You just...

173
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,930
...tear it off and...

174
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,700
...you got a new one right here.

175
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,890
Then, you're gone.

176
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,250
You're gone, all right.

177
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,790
Hey, where you going?
You gonna take a trip? The map...

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,440
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont
with Vanessa for a few days.

179
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,800
Hey, can I use your place?

180
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,510
I got a bunch of friends coming over
this weekend.

181
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,410
- What friends?
- Just people I met at a rock concert.

182
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,710
You mind if they use your bed?

183
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,480
Because they're good people, Jerry.
You know, they're anarchists.

184
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,300
They're... They're huge.

185
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,640
George, what?

186
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,510
You're kidding.

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,910
Well, what's wrong?

188
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,940
So, what are we gonna do?

189
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,960
Great. All right, I'll speak to you later.

190
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,650
Wilkenson, the guy who's supposed
to tell us when to sell the stock...

191
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,950
...he's in the hospital.

192
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,500
You don't know what's wrong
with him?

193
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,620
All Simons was able to find out
is that he's in the hospital.

194
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,900
Okay, fine.
Has Simons been in touch with him?

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,760
Of course he's been in touch with him.
He left two messages.

196
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,630
He hasn't heard back yet,
that's all.

197
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,200
Well, this is it. I'm selling.

198
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,810
Just give it a little more time.

199
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,930
I never should've gotten involved
with this, I'm a nervous wreck...

200
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,600
...l'm not cut out for investing.

201
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,900
All right. That's it.
I'm gonna go down there.

202
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,300
- Where?
- To the hospital.

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,530
- The hospital?
- I'm gonna find out what's going on.

204
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,660
Are you nuts?
You don't even know the guy.

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,680
So what?
I'll start talking to him, you know...

206
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,180
...casual, I'll work my way
around to it.

207
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,790
What if he's in an iron lung
or something?

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,870
What are you gonna do?

209
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,520
"How you feeling, Mr. Wilkenson?

210
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,680
By the way,
what's happening with Centrax?"

211
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,970
Maybe he's there resting.

212
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,990
Who goes to a hospital to rest?

213
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,660
What are you, a doctor?

214
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,060
Okay, fine.
When are you going down there?

215
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,150
Today. I'm going today.

216
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,070
Just don't do anything
until you hear from me.

217
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,150
All right.

218
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,280
Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

219
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,000
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I picked up this shirt yesterday.

220
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,290
It's completely shrunk.

221
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,170
There's absolutely no way
I can wear it.

222
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,980
- When did you bring it in?
- What's the difference? Look.

223
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,170
Do you see the size of this shirt?

224
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,510
- You got a receipt?
- I can't find the receipt.

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,220
- You should get the receipt.
- Look, forget the receipt.

226
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,310
Even if I had the receipt, look at it.

227
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,710
It's a hand puppet.

228
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,100
What am I gonna do with this?

229
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,380
Yes, but how do I know
we did the shirt?

230
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,090
What do you think,
this is a little scam I have?

231
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,380
I take this tiny shirt all over the city...

232
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,260
...conning dry cleaners
out of money?

233
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,810
Forget money.
I don't even want the money.

234
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,930
I just once would like to hear
a dry cleaner admit...

235
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,380
...that something was their fault.
That's what I want.

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,570
I want an admission of guilt.

237
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,010
Maybe you asked for it to be washed.

238
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,340
No. Dry-cleaned.

239
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,950
Let me explain
to you something, okay?

240
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,640
With certain types of fabrics, different
chemicals can react, causing...

241
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,460
You shrunk it.
You know you shrunk it.

242
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,480
Just tell me you shrunk it.

243
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,070
I shrunk it.

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,350
I think the only reason
we go to the dry cleaner...

245
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,330
...is so I can say to the dry cleaner:

246
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,100
"Well, it's ruined."

247
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,230
Of course the dry cleaner
can respond:

248
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
"It's not our fault.

249
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,130
We're not responsible.
We just ruin the clothes.

250
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,050
That ends our legal obligation."

251
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,550
See, the whole problem
with dry-cleaning...

252
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,510
...is that we all believe
that this is actually possible.

253
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,430
Right?
They're cleaning our clothes...

254
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,940
...but they're not getting anything wet.

255
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,440
It's all dry.

256
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,090
I know there's gotta be some liquids
back there, some fluids they're using.

257
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,070
There's no such thing as dry-cleaning.

258
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,450
When you get something on your
shirt, ever try and get it off like that?

259
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,120
That's dry-cleaning.

260
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,450
I don't think that's what they're doing,
have 80 guys going:

261
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,850
"Come on. Hurry up.

262
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,460
There's a lot of shirts today."

263
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,090
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

264
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,450
What evidence is there that cats are
so smart anyway? What do they do?

265
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,580
Because they're clean?

266
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm sorry. My uncle Pete
showers four times a day...

267
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,500
...and he can't count to 10,
so don't give me hygiene.

268
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,070
So, what are you gonna do?

269
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,510
I don't know.
I can't think of any solution.

270
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,480
Unless, of course, they should meet
with some unfortunate accident.

271
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,780
What do you think a hit man would
charge to rub out a couple of cats?

272
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,700
Well, it couldn't be too expensive.

273
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,140
Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?

274
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,200
What do you think, Jerry,
you wanna make 28 bucks?

275
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,810
I'm no cat killer.

276
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,610
How about we go over there
right now...

277
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,010
...and we shave them?

278
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,760
I'd really like to go, Elaine.

279
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,100
But George is coming back
from the hospital, I gotta wait for him.

280
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,540
But otherwise, I would definitely go.

281
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,350
He actually went to the hospital?

282
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,860
- Yeah.
- Man, he's nuts.

283
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,130
Yeah, he's nuts.
You wanna bump off a couple of cats.

284
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,540
I know, I know. It's down again.

285
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,620
How much you down altogether?

286
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,600
I don't know, $1500.

287
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Wow.

288
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,500
You don't have to say "wow."
I know it's "wow."

289
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,570
And there's that smile again.

290
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,030
What is that?

291
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,750
It's George.

292
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,410
Yeah.

293
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,610
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop.
Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

294
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,700
I really don't need to look.

295
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,300
What a body.

296
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,120
Yeah. That's for me.

297
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,770
Yeah, and you're just what
she's looking for too.

298
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,360
Stranger leering through
a pair of binoculars 10 floors up.

299
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm gonna go down
and try and talk to her.

300
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,710
What?

301
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,790
What, did you go down there?

302
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,340
Did he tell you what's gonna happen?

303
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,220
How long were you there?

304
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,180
Fifteen seconds.

305
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,470
You told him you knew Simons.

306
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,870
Yeah, I mentioned Simons.

307
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,730
Next thing I know,
I'm in the parking lot!

308
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,900
Perhaps they had some sort
of a falling out.

309
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,670
I'll tell you one thing.

310
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,680
I don't know what he's got,
but for a sick guy, he's very strong.

311
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,280
Well, that's it.

312
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,200
Look, I'm going to Vermont.
I don't wanna think about this.

313
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,190
I'm selling.

314
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,460
- Didn't work, huh?
- Not quite.

315
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,110
Well, what are you gonna do
about the stock?

316
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm keeping it.

317
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm going down with the ship.

318
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,250
So I know this guy, I'm getting
all my sneakers at a discount now.

319
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,820
I know. You mentioned it.

320
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,010
Oh, yeah. Right.

321
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,760
Oh, God, get me out of here.
What a mistak e.

322
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,060
What made me think
this would work?

323
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,080
And I've still got another day.

324
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,060
I've got nothing left to say.

325
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,360
Wait, wait. I've got one.

326
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,550
That's a nice watch.

327
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,110
Yeah.

328
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,300
Do you wind it?

329
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,390
No. It's got a little battery.

330
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,260
Well, that's good.

331
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,970
Well, the drive home
should be a delight.

332
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,620
I'm speeding the whole way.
Let them throw me in jail, I don't care.

333
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,540
That's the manager, wanna see
if we can get another room?

334
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,900
No, it's okay.

335
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,860
So I guess you don't find the separate
faucets for the hot and the cold...

336
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,320
...charming?

337
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,780
Not especially.

338
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,180
Well, what do you wanna do
this afternoon?

339
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,890
What can we do? It's raining.

340
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,170
We could play Sorry.

341
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,750
We could play
Steal the Old Man's Bundle.

342
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,550
Maybe I can get an extension cord
and hang myself.

343
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,830
What kind of perfume is that
you're wearing?

344
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,330
Oh, you've never heard of it.

345
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,410
No. What kind is it?

346
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,810
I can't tell you.

347
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah, that's real normal.

348
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,960
Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look
at that business section?

349
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,950
- The stock?
- Thank you.

350
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,610
Thought you got out of that.

351
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,280
I did. I'm just curious.

352
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,100
It's been almost a week.
I wanna check it out.

353
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,480
Six points?

354
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,920
It's up six points.

355
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,050
- I told you not to sell.
- You did not tell me not to sell.

356
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,130
I said the market fluctuates.
Remember?

357
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,900
Look, Vanessa...

358
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,820
...of course the market fluctuates.
Everybody knows that.

359
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,950
I just got fluctuated out of $4000.

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
That's probably why we're...

361
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,480
- What?
- Forget it.

362
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,150
No, that's probably why...

363
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,020
That's probably why
we're staying here...

364
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,630
...because you lost money
on the stock.

365
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,240
So, what am I looking at here?

366
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,850
Twenty-nine hours to go?

367
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,020
Well, at least I got plenty of time
to find out the name of that perfume.

368
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,460
James, he kills me.

369
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,800
Have something else.
Have a little dessert.

370
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,090
- I'm good, thanks.
- Elaine, get something.

371
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,390
- It's all taken care of.
- I'm kind of full.

372
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,370
So don't finish it.

373
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,770
She's full.

374
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,880
So, big daddy...

375
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,380
...l'm just curious.
How much did you clear...

376
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,510
...on your little transaction there,
all told?

377
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,530
- I don't like to discuss figures.
- How much?

378
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,680
I don't know, $8000. It's a Hyundai.
Get out of here.

379
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,290
I told you not to sell.

380
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,210
Simons made money,
Wilkenson cleaned up.

381
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,090
So Wilkenson's out of the hospital?

382
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,280
No. You'd be surprised.

383
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,510
You don't recover that quickly
from a nose job.

384
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,310
Is that still from those cats?

385
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,080
No.

386
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,960
I just got a cold.

387
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,620
Whatever happened with that?

388
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,230
I gave him an ultimatum.

389
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,920
He chose the cats?

390
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,530
They're very clean animals.

391
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,540
I gotta say, that's pretty bad,
losing out to a cat.

392
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,770
Almost as bad as losing out
to a perfume.

393
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,650
Told you those trips
are relationship-killers.

394
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,680
Too bad you can't get your buddy
Superman...

395
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,220
...to fly around the Earth
at super speed...

396
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,100
...and reverse time.

397
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,540
Get all the money back, could've
avoided the whole trip to Vermont.

398
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,730
Superman can go back in time?

399
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,710
We went over that.

400
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,510
Wilkenson's got a bite on a new one.

401
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,680
The Tramco Corporation.

402
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,460
Out of...

403
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,850
...Springfield, I think.

404
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,500
They're about to introduce
some sort...

405
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,690
...of a robot butcher.

406
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,090
A robot butcher?

407
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,040
If you want to get in...

408
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,330
...very little time.

409
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,650
Sweetheart.

410
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,570
No, no. That ought to cover it.

411
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,950
Just a second. Just let me peek.

412
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,960
Good.

413
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,880
Come on, come on...

414
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,970
I'm not an investor.

415
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,990
People always say, "You should
have your money working for you."

416
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,180
I've decided I'll do the work...

417
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,060
...l'm gonna let the money relax.

418
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,770
Know what I mean? Because
you send your money out there...

419
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,790
...working for you,
a lot of times it gets fired.

420
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,920
You go back, "What happened?
I had my money working for me."

421
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,840
"Yeah, I remember your money.

422
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,490
Showing up late, taking time off.

423
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,580
We had to let him go."
