1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,790
So I'm on line at the supermarket.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,440
Two women in front of me.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,030
One of them, her total was $8.
The other, $3.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,930
They both, of course, choose
to pay by the use of the check.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,560
Fact is, if it is a woman in front of you
that's writing out the check...

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,330
...you'll not be waiting long.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,730
I have noticed that women
are very fast with checks.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,860
You know, because they write
out so many checks.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,980
The keys, they can never find.
They don't know where that is.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,740
But the checkbook, they got that.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,510
They never fumble
for the checkbook.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,280
The checkbook
comes out of a holster.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,470
"Who do I make it out to?

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,750
There's my ID."

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,110
There's something about a check,
that, to a man, is not masculine.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't know exactly what it is.
I think, to a man...

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,330
...a check is like a note
from your mother.

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,350
"I don't have any money,
but if you'll contact these people...

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,940
...l'm sure they'll stick up for me. If you
could just trust me this one time.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,650
I don't have any money,
but I have these.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,880
I wrote on these.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,110
Is this of any value at all?"

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,440
What's that one?

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,830
Cocoon II, The Return.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,920
I guess they didn't like it up there.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,210
Maybe they came back
for Chinese food.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,300
You know, Maureen Stapleton
gets a craving...

28
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,900
...she's probably screaming
at those aliens:

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,090
"I gotta have a lo mein."

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,720
Okay, what are we doing here?
I have seen everything.

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, yeah?

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,830
I don't believe you've seen this.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,070
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,400
What do you think their parents think?

35
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,320
"So, what's your son doing now,
Dr. Stevens?"

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,870
"Oh, he's a public fornicator."

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,680
"Yes, he's a fine boy."

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,370
You know, this would be a really
funny gift for Pamela's birthday.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,460
Pamela. Do I know her?

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,070
Yeah, you met her when
we were going out.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,570
Oh, yeah, right.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,910
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,890
No.

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,060
Blond hair, remember? Glasses.

45
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,230
Have you totally blocked out
the entire time we were a couple?

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,040
- Riverside Drive.
- Right.

47
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,590
In fact... No. Never mind.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,130
Well, what is it?

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,570
A bunch of people are getting
together tomorrow at some bar...

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,350
...for her birthday, but...

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,160
You don't want to go to that.
No. Okay.

52
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,120
Wait a second. Wait a second.

53
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,310
We could work out a little deal here.

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,860
- What little deal?
- I will go to that...

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,990
...you go with me to the little
family wedding I have on Saturday.

56
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,450
A wedding?

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,140
- Have you lost it, man?
- My parents are coming in for this.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,020
- They're coming in?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,410
Hey, did your father
ever get that hair weave?

60
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,980
No, no.

61
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,580
Still doing the big sweep across.

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,980
Why does he do that?

63
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,650
Doesn't think anyone can tell.

64
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,910
So, come on, do we have a deal?

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,370
A wedding?

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,970
There's a lot of people to mock.

67
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,460
- All right. What the hell.
- Great.

68
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,150
When you're dead, you're dead.
That's it. You're not going anywhere.

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,220
- Come on, let's go.
- Was I supposed to bring something?

70
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,200
- You could have.
- I met her one time.

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,910
- It is not necessary.
- Then what did you say that for?

72
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,210
- Hi.
- Hi, Pamela.

73
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,710
- You remember Jerry?
- Yes, we met.

74
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,840
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,230
Everybody, this is Jerry and Elaine.

76
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,090
I didn't bring anything.

78
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,640
- I put you two right here.
- Oh, okay.

79
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,390
I'm sorry. I didn't know what...
You know.

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,410
Nobody's told me anything
about this...

81
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,960
How big a tip you think it
would take to get him to stop?

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,730
I'm in for 5.

83
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
I'll supply the hat.

84
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,530
What do we have here?

85
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,140
Why don't you relax,
and take your jacket off.

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,850
I can't. I have a tendency
to get chilly.

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,350
How masculine.

88
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,730
Plus I'm wearing short sleeves.
I don't want to expose my tattoos.

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,380
She's unbelievable.

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,650
- Hey, this guy says he know Bricker.
- Oh, you know Bricker? From where?

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,220
What's going on here?

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Got to be her boyfriend.
She's too good to be alone.

93
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,640
What's the difference?
I can't manoeuvre anyway...

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,990
...with Elaine next to me.

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,120
- How do you know Pamela?
- Friend of a friend.

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,420
- And you?
- We went to law school together.

97
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,290
Oh, Jerry.

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,730
Oh, no. Not now.

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,170
I had this dream last night,
and you were in it.

100
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,140
Oh, God, I gotta get out of this.

102
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,060
You were you, but you weren't you.

103
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,560
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,890
Why is this happening?
Please mak e her stop.

105
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,230
I think... I think we were in my
house where I grew up...

106
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,150
...and you were standing there.
You were looking out the window.

107
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,130
This is brutal.

108
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,820
And then you turned around,
and you had these wooden teeth.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,530
How do you like that?

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,410
Can I turn now? Is this over?

111
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,790
No, I can't. I can't. I'm stuck.

112
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,500
Jerry, are you listening to me?

113
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,960
Yes. I heard you.

114
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,300
Elaine, what's the name of that
jewellery store you took me to that time?

115
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,900
Thank you, Pamela.

116
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,160
So, you're a lawyer?

117
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,550
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

118
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,140
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

119
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,790
Of course, they handled
my tattoo-removal lawsuit.

120
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,880
- Oh, that was you.
- Imagine.

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,540
Spelling "mom" with two O's.

122
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,840
That's very funny.

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,240
- What do you do?
- Comedian.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,740
Really? That explains it.

125
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,640
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

126
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,310
You ready?

127
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,710
We gotta run. Happy birthday.

128
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,210
- Bye, everyone.
- Thanks for coming.

129
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

130
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,170
I can't believe it. I got nothing.

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,460
I don't even know her name.

132
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,740
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,390
That wasn't so bad, really.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,310
You know...

135
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,750
...you could use a little work
on your manners.

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,460
Why? What did I do?

137
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,910
Well, I just don't appreciate
these little courtesy responses...

138
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,180
...like I'm selling you aluminium siding.
- I was listening.

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,830
No. You couldn't wait to get back
to your little conversation.

140
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,900
No. You were talking
about the dream you had...

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,710
...where you had wooden teeth.
- No!

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,800
No! You had wooden teeth!

143
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,130
You had wooden teeth.
I didn't have them, you did.

144
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,840
All right, so I had wooden teeth.
So what?

145
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,660
So... So nothing. Nothing.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,350
Apparently Plato...

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,900
...who came up with the concept
of the platonic relationship...

148
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,190
...was pretty excited about it.

149
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,030
He named it after himself. He said,
"Yeah, I got this new thing.

150
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,320
Platonic.

151
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,560
My idea, my name.
Calling it after myself.

152
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,000
What I do is...

153
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,870
...I go out with the girls...

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,330
...I talk with them...

155
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,900
...don't do anything...

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,770
...and go right home.

157
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,170
What do you think?

158
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,090
I think it's going to be big."

159
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,320
I bet you other guys
in history tried...

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,870
...getting relationships named
after them, but it didn't work.

161
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,000
I bet you there were guys
that tried to do it. Just went:

162
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,120
"Hi, my name's Rico.

163
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,630
Would you like to go
to bed immediately?

164
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,070
Hey, it's a 'riconic' relationship."

165
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,160
- Hey.
- There he is.

166
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,450
This is what I like. See?

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,890
You come home, your parents
are in your bed.

168
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,790
You know, Jerry,
we don't have to do this.

169
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,400
What are you talking about?
I love having you here.

170
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,940
- Tomorrow, we'll go to a hotel.
- Ma, will you stop?

171
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,030
No. Why should we take over
your apartment?

172
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,320
I don't care. I'm sleeping next door.

173
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,990
Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?

174
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,760
No. He's making a bouillabaisse.

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,830
So, Dad, let me ask you a question.

176
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,650
How many people work
at these big law offices?

177
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,940
- Depends on the firm.
- Yeah, but if you called...

178
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,960
...and described someone,
you think they would know who it was?

179
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,950
What's the matter, you need a lawyer?

180
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,220
I met someone. I know where she
works, but I don't know her name.

181
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,410
Why don't you ask
someone who was at the party?

182
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,640
No. The only one I could ask
is Elaine. I can't ask her.

183
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,500
- Why not?
- Because it's complicated.

184
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,790
There's some tension there.

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,770
He used to go with her.

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,440
- Which one is she?
- From Maryland.

187
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,570
She brought the chocolate-covered
cherries you didn't like.

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,010
Oh, yeah. Very alert. Warm person.

189
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh, yeah, she's great.

190
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,970
So how come nothing
materialized there?

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Well, it's a tough thing
to talk about.

192
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,150
- I don't know.
- I know what it was.

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,960
You don't know what it was.

194
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,630
So what was it?

195
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,870
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

196
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,890
- Oh, well.
- Oh, well.

197
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,750
And there was a little problem
with the physical chemistry.

198
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,760
Well, I think she's
a very attractive girl.

199
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,740
She is. She absolutely is.

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,820
I can see if there was
a weight problem...

201
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,390
No, it's not that.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,060
It wasn't all one-sided.

203
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,700
You know you can't be so particular.
Nobody's perfect.

204
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,210
- I know, I know.
- You know, Jerry...

205
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,080
...good thing I wasn't so particular.

206
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,480
Idiot.

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,170
- Who you looking for, Sophia Loren?
- That's got nothing to do with it.

208
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,410
How about Loni Anderson?

209
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,120
Where do you get Loni Anderson?

210
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,200
Why, what's wrong
with Loni Anderson?

211
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,500
I like Elaine more than
Loni Anderson.

212
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,420
What are you two talking about?

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,500
Look, Elaine just wasn't the one.

214
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
And this other one's the one?

215
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,860
- I don't know. Maybe.
- So ask Elaine there for the number.

216
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,840
I can't. She'll get upset.

217
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,140
I never talk about
other women with her...

218
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,160
...especially this one tonight.
- How could you still see her...

219
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,980
...if you're not interested?
- We're friends.

220
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,690
Doesn't sound like you're friends.
If you were friends...

221
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,400
...you'd ask her for the number.

222
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,210
- Do you know where this one works?
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,780
So go up to the office.

224
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,450
Up to her office?

225
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,010
Go to the building.

226
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,890
She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?

227
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,910
- I guess.
- So you stand in the lobby...

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,450
...by the elevator and wait for her
to come down for lunch.

229
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,480
You mean stake out the lobby?

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,540
Morty, that's ridiculous.
Just ask Elaine for the number.

231
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,730
He doesn't want to ask Elaine
for the number.

232
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,240
So you got him standing
by the elevator like a dope.

233
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,780
- What happens when he sees her?
- He pretends he bumped into her.

234
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,930
You know what?
This is not that bad an idea.

235
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,280
- What does she look like?
- I don't know. It's hard to say.

236
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,580
What actress does she
remind you of?

237
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,460
Loni Anderson.

238
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,580
Loni Anderson?

239
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,710
What, there's something wrong
with Loni Anderson?

240
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,320
Hey, listen, thanks again
for running over here.

241
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,340
Yeah, sure. I was showing
a condo on 48th Street.

242
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,050
Besides, you think
I want to miss this?

243
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,950
- I'm a little nervous.
- Yeah. Me too.

244
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,600
If I see her, what do I say
I'm doing in the building?

245
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,690
To see me. I work in the building.

246
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,670
What do you do?

247
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,480
I'm an architect.

248
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,780
You're an architect?

249
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,070
I'm not?

250
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,490
I don't see architecture
coming from you.

251
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,850
I suppose you could be an architect.

252
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,360
I never said that I was the architect.

253
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,070
- Just something else.
- She's not even going to ask.

254
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,050
If we see her, which is remote.

255
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,340
What do you want me to say,
I just wandered in?

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,260
We're having lunch with a friend.
He works here.

257
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,560
What is his name?

258
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,790
Burt Har...

259
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,500
...binson. Burt Harbinson.

260
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
- Burt Harbinson.
- Right.

261
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,500
- It sounds made-up.
- No good?

262
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,590
All right.

263
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,780
Art...

264
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,070
...Core.

265
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,160
Art Core.

266
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,660
Velay.

267
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,580
- Corevelay?
- Yeah, right.

268
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,560
Well, what does he do?

269
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,580
He's an importer.

270
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,670
Just imports? No exports?

271
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,070
He's an importer-exporter, okay?

272
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,490
Did Elaine ever call you back?

273
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,310
No. I guess she's still mad.

274
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,330
I don't understand. You never talk
to her about other women?

275
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,890
Never.

276
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,690
Wait a second. That's her.

277
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,460
On the right.

278
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,420
I forgot who I am. Who am I?

279
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,240
You're you. We're having lunch
with Art Corevelay.

280
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,950
- Vandalay.
- Corevelay.

281
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,770
Let me be the architect.
I can do it. I can do it.

282
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,370
Hey, hey...

283
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,140
Pamela's birthday party.

284
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,000
- Didn't I see you there? Jerry.
- Sure. Hi.

285
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,590
- This is George. I'm sorry.
- Vanessa.

286
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,360
Nice to meet you.

287
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,070
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

288
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,580
That's right. What are you doing here?

289
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,700
Meeting a friend for lunch.
Works in the building.

290
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah, Art Vandalay.

291
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,150
Oh, really?

292
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,500
Which company?

293
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,940
- I don't know. He's an importer.
- I don't really know...

294
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,030
- Importer.
- And exporter.

295
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,950
He's an importer-exporter.

296
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm...

297
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,220
I'm an architect.

298
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,810
Really? Well, what do you design?

299
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,810
Railroads.

300
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,420
I thought engineers do that.

301
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,130
They can.

302
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm sorry you had to leave
so early the other night.

303
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,660
Me too. My cousin
had to go back to Boston.

304
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,520
- Oh, that guy was your cousin.
- Yeah.

305
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,500
- And that woman was your...
- Friend.

306
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,710
I'll just get a paper.

307
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,840
So...

308
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,030
...do you date immature men?

309
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,360
Almost exclusively.

310
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,690
I have no letters.

311
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,670
Ma, will you go already?

312
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,990
- What are you doing?
- I just want to see something.

313
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,010
You can't look in there.
We're playing.

314
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,640
- Good evening, Mr. Kramer.
- Hey, Morty.

316
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,520
- Salad dressing?
- Look.

317
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,710
- "Quo." Is that a word?
- Maybe.

318
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
- Will you challenge it?
- Ma, you can't look up words...

319
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,820
...in the dictionary.
Dad, she's cheating.

320
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,900
"Quo"? That's not a word.

321
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,550
- You're such a stickler.
- Well, put something down.

322
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,270
You're taking 20 minutes on this.

323
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,390
So Uncle Mac and Artie, they're all
coming here before the wedding?

324
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,850
They'll be here at 2:00.

325
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,340
Oh, Elaine called. She said she'd
be here at 2:30 and she says:

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,300
"Hope your meeting went well
with Art Vandalay."

327
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,280
- She said what?
- Just what I said. Here.

328
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,810
She knows.

329
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,770
Oh, I am such a jackass.

330
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,110
- She knows what?
- She knows the whole stupid thing.

331
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,190
Vanessa and the elevator.

332
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,590
No, no, that won't do.
He may have a Z.

333
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,470
So how did she find out?

334
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,120
Because Vanessa
probably told Pamela...

335
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,080
...and Pamela probably told Elaine.

336
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,100
So, what are you, afraid of her?

337
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,820
Yes. Yes, I am.

338
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,940
- What else did she say on the phone?
- Whatever I wrote down.

339
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,110
Yeah, but what was the tone
in her voice? How did she sound?

340
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,410
Who am I, Rich Little?

341
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,790
Well, she can't be too mad.

342
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,020
- She's still coming to the wedding.
- Yeah, but now I'm nervous.

343
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,210
Oh, stop it.

344
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,450
- "Quone"?
- Thirty, 31, 32...

345
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,110
"Quone"?

346
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,030
No, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to challenge that.

347
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,540
No, you don't have to
challenge that. That's a word.

348
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
- That's a definite word.
- I am challenging.

349
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,650
"Quone." To "quone" something.

350
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,760
I'm not playing with you anymore.

351
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,470
"Quone's" not a word.

352
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,860
No good. Sorry. There it is.

353
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,740
Get it off.

354
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,030
Why did you make me put that down?

355
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,060
No. We need a medical dictionary.

356
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,400
Like a patient gets difficult,
you quone him.

357
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,650
You want some funny material? You
ought to come down to where I work.

358
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,780
There's a sitcom.

359
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,220
You must have quite
a time down there.

360
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,180
- We got plenty of time.
- Sorry. I am just waiting for someone.

361
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,040
Watch what you say to this guy.
He'll put it in his next act.

362
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,540
- Yeah, yeah.
- Jerry, did I tell you...

363
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,040
...that I'm writing a book,
an autobiography?

364
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,710
Yeah, you mentioned it.

365
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,630
It's based on all my experiences.

366
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,030
That's perfect.

367
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,010
- Could you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

368
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,890
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

369
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,230
How do you do? Jerry Seinfeld.

370
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

371
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,570
You want to do this now,
or you wanna wait?

372
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh, no, let's do it now.

373
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,530
The whole elevator business,
let me just explain.

374
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,930
- Okay.
- Jerry, are you going with us?

375
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,370
- No, I'm gonna take my car.
- That's why I brought the wagon.

376
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,080
Why the hell
did I bring the wagon?

377
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,790
Anyway, you know
why I didn't ask you?

378
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,070
I mean, I felt so uncomfortable,
and you were so annoyed in the cab.

379
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,090
Well, Jerry, I never saw you
flirt with anyone before.

380
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,490
It was quite the spectacle.

381
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,370
Jerry, we'll see you there.
Bye, Elaine.

382
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh, bye. Good to see you.

383
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,230
Oh, we didn't meet.

384
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,730
Sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin,
Artie Levine.

385
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,810
- Levine.
- Artie.

386
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,630
Artie! Come on.

387
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,340
Yeah, Levine.

388
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,470
And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp.

389
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,830
Anyway, I admit it was a fairly
ridiculous thing to do...

390
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,370
...but I mean, obviously
we have a little problem here.

391
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,830
Yeah, obviously.

392
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,590
If we're gonna be friends, we gotta
be able to talk about other people.

393
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,780
- Couldn't agree more.
- Good.

394
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,800
- Good.
- Good.

395
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,240
Great.

396
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,790
Great? Where do you get great?

397
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,370
It's great to talk about...

398
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,400
...other people.
- Guys.

399
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

400
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,820
Well, anybody specific?

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,630
No.

402
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,030
- A general guy.
- Oh, really?

403
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,950
- Elaine Marie Benes.
- What?

404
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,830
No, it's not a big deal.

405
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,710
No, that's great. That's terrific.

406
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,580
- No, we just met.
- Doesn't matter.

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,340
What's the young man's name?
I would like to meet him.

408
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,940
I don't think so.

409
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,340
Well, what does he do?
Is he an artisan...

410
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,470
...a craftsman,
a labourer of some sort?

411
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,700
- Wall Street.
- High finance.

412
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,310
Bulls, bears,
people from Connecticut.

413
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,000
And he happens to be
pretty good-looking.

414
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
All right, sir.

415
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,670
And he's hilarious.

416
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,110
- Now that's not fair.
- You know.

417
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,990
So where did you meet this guy?

418
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
I staked out his health club.

419
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,200
When you're on a stakeout...

420
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,330
...do you find it's better
to stand up against the wall...

421
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,670
...or kind of crouch down
behind a big plant?

422
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,210
You know, I think that...

423
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,760
...even if you've had
a relationship with someone...

424
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,100
...or, let's say, especially if you've had
a relationship with someone...

425
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,910
...and you try and become
friends afterwards...

426
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,680
...it's very difficult. Isn't this?

427
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,750
It's hard because you
know each other so well.

428
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,830
You know? You know all
each other's tricks.

429
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,440
It's like two magicians trying
to entertain each other.

430
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,190
You know, one goes, "Look, a rabbit."
The other goes, "So?"

431
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,050
"I believe that's your card."

432
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,000
"Look, why don't we just saw each
other in half and call it a night, okay?"
