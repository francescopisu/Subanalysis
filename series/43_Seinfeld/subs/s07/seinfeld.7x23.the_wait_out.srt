1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:06,279
The concept of being separated
is strange.

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,278
It's like you're engaged
to be divorced.

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:11,484
"We're gonna try and make
not being together work.

4
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:14,286
First we were separated, then we met,
then we were together.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,358
Now we're gonna try
being separated again.

6
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:19,963
We think actually some sort of giant
rubber band might be the solution."

7
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,879
Of course, when you were
a kid in school...

8
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,242
...you'd get separated
for having too good a time.

9
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,682
"If you two kids don't stop laughing
and having fun...

10
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:28,678
...l'm gonna have to separate you."

11
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,642
Then the kid finds out his parents
are breaking up...

12
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:35,561
...thinks it's because they got caught
fooling around, which is probably true.

13
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:44,118
- Hairdo?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,482
You look like Brenda Starr.

15
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,801
- Is that good?
- Better than Dondi.

16
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,398
Hey, my God, look at that.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,159
It's David and Beth Lukner.

18
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,842
You know, I heard a rumour
their marriage is a little rocky.

19
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,885
Really? You know, I have
a little thing for Beth Lukner.

20
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:03,400
Well...

21
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:08,197
I have to admit I've always thought
David was kind of sponge-worthy.

22
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,559
Yeah, I've been waiting out
their marriage for three years.

23
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,321
Me too. Well, I've been waiting out
two or three marriages...

24
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,682
...but this is the one I really
had my eye on.

25
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,878
This car out there is taking up
like three parking spaces.

26
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,639
That's mine.

27
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,079
- You have a car?
- My friend lent it to me for the week.

28
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,238
- She's out of town.
- I've never seen you drive.

29
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:30,999
- Me neither.
- Jerry?

30
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,000
- Elaine, hi.
- Hi, David.

31
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,316
Hi, Beth.

32
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,322
Oh, George,
this is my husband, David.

33
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:39,806
- Oh, hi, David.
- Hello.

34
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,435
George, you're the one who works
for the Yankees, right?

35
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,926
Yeah. Why, what do you do?

36
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,238
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth
used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.

37
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,601
- Really?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,956
A physician married to a salesman.

39
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:55,039
I gotta tell you, Beth, you could have
done a lot better than him.

40
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,558
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Mickey, what's going on?

41
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,480
I'm nervous. I'm auditioning to be
in the Actors Studio tonight.

42
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:12,435
- Really?
- It's Method, Jerry. It's intense.

43
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,563
- Kramer's my scene partner.
- Kramer?

44
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,126
He doesn't have to say anything.

45
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,403
He just has to sit there.
I'm playing a detective.

46
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,523
I'm playing a businessman
accused of murder.

47
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,040
Oh, boy.

48
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,243
I gotta meet Elaine
and run some errands, so...

49
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:26,120
Look at this, Mickey.

50
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:27,640
These pants are falling apart.

51
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,162
When I met you, you used
to wear jeans all the time.

52
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,885
Well, I was a different man then.

53
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,038
With a different body.

54
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:40,240
Hey, I got the body of a taut,
preteen Swedish boy.

55
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,958
I don't know.

56
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,244
What are you thinking? You think that
I'm not able to wear jeans anymore?

57
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,843
Is that what you're saying?
Because I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.

58
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,317
I swear to God, I will.

59
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,359
Don't think I won't, Jerry.

60
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,597
All right. That's it.

61
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,806
God, it is so great to drive again.

62
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,322
I miss it so much.

63
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,283
How about a left turn signal,
you moron!

64
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,285
I'm so nauseous.

65
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,926
She's the worst driver.

66
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,682
You know what,
on my first road test, I hit a dog.

67
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,646
I think it was a golden retriever.

68
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,718
No, no, no, it was a yellow lab.

69
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,922
I gotta check my messages.

70
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,726
Hey.

71
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,278
I'm so carsick I'm gonna v omit.

72
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,161
Oh, my God, Jerry.

73
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,799
My friend Kim called.

74
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,037
David and Beth
got separated last night.

75
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,926
- Yeah?
- They're getting divorced!

76
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,717
So now, what is our move?
What do we do?

77
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:54,684
I don't know,
but we don't have much time.

78
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,077
City's teeming with people
waiting out that marriage.

79
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:58,521
Right.

80
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:01,155
It's like when a tenant dies
in a rent-controlled building.

81
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,999
You gotta take immediate action.

82
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,841
But David and Beth are gonna need
their grieving time.

83
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,646
Their grieving time is a luxury
I can't afford.

84
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:11,367
I'm calling Beth tonight,
and if you want a shot at David...

85
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,085
...I suggest you do likewise.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,920
But we gotta make it seem like
we're not calling for dates.

87
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:17,725
Then why are we calling?

88
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,359
- Good question. Why are we calling?
- Why are we calling?

89
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,566
- Calling, calling, calling.
- Why are we calling? Why do we call?

90
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,478
I got it. I've got it.

91
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,764
We're calling just to say:

92
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,885
"I'm there for you."

93
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,046
I'm there for you.

94
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:41,756
Then, after a period
of being there for you...

95
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:46,364
...we slowly remove
the two words "for you"...

96
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:50,202
...and we're just there.

97
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,441
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,359
Remember Beth and David
from yesterday?

99
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,597
- They got separated.
- Really?

100
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:01,077
Well, you don't think it had anything
to do with what I said, do you?

101
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:03,956
What did you say?

102
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,199
You know, that thing
about her being too good for him.

103
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,962
I mean, I was just being folksy.
They could tell I was being folksy?

104
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,005
- Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
- Totally folksy.

105
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,878
Hey...

106
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,999
- What did you get?
- I bought dungarees.

107
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,203
Kramer, they're painted on.

108
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,919
Well, they're the slim fit.

109
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,725
- Slim fit?
- Yeah, they're streamlined.

110
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,596
You're walking like Frankenstein.

111
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,246
They just gotta be worked in
a little bit, that's all.

112
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,846
See you.

113
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,843
Well, David, it happens.

114
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,805
Sure, Beth, these things happen.

115
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:17,084
So have you told many people yet?

116
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,920
Because it's really
nobody's business.

117
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,647
Anyway, I just called
to tell you that...

118
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,763
...l'm there for you.

119
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,442
There is...

120
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,447
...anywhere you want me to be.

121
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,279
Sure. Dinner would be fine.

122
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,281
And I can just be there for you.

123
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,119
- Jerry, you gotta help me.
- What's wrong?

124
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,006
I can't get my pants off.
Mickey's audition is in 20 minutes.

125
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,522
I'm supposed to be a businessman.
I gotta be in costume.

126
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,996
All right. Undo them,
I'll help you get them off.

127
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,204
- I already did, and it won't come off.
- You just gotta wiggle your hips.

128
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,925
Pull down.

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,845
All right. All right.
That's no good.

130
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,963
Let me try getting them
from the bottom.

131
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,640
Just give me...

132
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,367
Wait. Jerry, wait a minute.

133
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,677
Man, these are tight.

134
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,680
- Squinch your hips in.
- I am squinching my hips.

135
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,320
Keep squinching them.

136
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,596
All right, that's not gonna work.
That's not gonna work.

137
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,997
Let me just think for a second here.

138
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,203
You better get me.

139
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,163
Get me up, get me up.

140
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,999
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

141
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,204
Look, you're gonna need the
Jaws of Life to get out of those things.

142
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,005
I don't have time.
I'm gonna be late.

143
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,159
- Maybe you could soak in a tub.
- You better get the door.

144
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,160
It was nice to get your call.

145
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,524
Well, I just want you to know
I'm there for you.

146
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,246
Of course, now I'm here for you...

147
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,637
...but when I'm not here for you,
I'm there for you.

148
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,205
Well, wherever you are,
I appreciate it.

149
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,641
So how did this all happen?

150
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:03,961
Well, actually, it had a lot to do
with George's comment.

151
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:09,723
- Is that right?
- I thought maybe I could do better.

152
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,360
Maybe, maybe.

153
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,006
Well, it wasn't just that.

154
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,964
I realized after
three years of marriage...

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,516
...that David's little quirks
were getting on my nerves.

156
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,804
Three years is a long time
to be married.

157
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:29,000
In the middle of our fight last night,
he did this thing that he always does...

158
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,000
...where he asks questions
to himself aloud...

159
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,361
...and then answers them.

160
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:36,917
Am I happy Beth left me?
Of course not.

161
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,806
Can I hope to pick up the pieces
and move on? Absolutely.

162
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,642
You're gonna pick up the pieces.

163
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,843
We just had
our third anniversary on April 8th.

164
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:45,962
- Tenth.
- Right.

165
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,401
Right.

166
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:53,718
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
this whole thing is George's fault.

167
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:57,562
Well, David, the thing
about George is that...

168
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,957
...he's an idiot.

169
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,480
All right. Auditioning next
is Mickey Abbott...

170
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,477
...doing a scene from
the Terence Klufer play...

171
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,000
...Flesh Wounds in Ithaca.

172
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,796
I'm sorry, my scene partner
isn't here yet so I guess...

173
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,165
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's with the jeans?

174
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,840
- You're a businessman.
- Long story.

175
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,804
Well, just get up here.

176
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,644
So, Bradley...

177
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,605
...I guess this is the last place
you expected to find yourself.

178
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,725
Well, we're gonna be here a while,
so take a seat.

179
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,356
If it hadn't been
for that secretary of yours...

180
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:52,240
I said, sit down.

181
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,406
Are you deaf, Bradley?
I said, sit down.

182
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:03,363
Bradley, it's very important
that you sit down.

183
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,639
Now, for the last time...

184
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,686
...try again to sit down!

185
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,566
Sit down, you big, stupid ape!

186
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,927
Did I have a great time with
David Lukner last night?

187
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,516
I sure did.

188
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,243
Do I think there's a future here?

189
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,079
I don't see why not.

190
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:33,640
I'll tell you, that "there for you" crap
was a stroke of genius.

191
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,483
- Oh, please.
- Never mind.

192
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,921
- Oh, come on.
- You're a genius.

193
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,440
All right.

194
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,880
Hey.

195
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,515
- Georgie!
- Hey, there he is!

196
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,917
Georgie boy!

197
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,926
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

198
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,237
You're the man of the hour,
that's what's going on.

199
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,681
- Right.
- What do you mean?

200
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,078
Well, thanks to you and your little
comment there to David and Beth...

201
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:00,761
...Jerry and I
are in prime pouncing position...

202
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:05,364
...to scoop these two up
before they know what hit them.

203
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,158
So it was my comment
that broke them up?

204
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,119
- According to them.
- Yeah.

205
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,243
I feel terrible.

206
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,080
I can't be responsible
for breaking up a marriage.

207
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,600
- Oh, no.
- Where are you going?

208
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,359
Well, I gotta go talk to Beth.

209
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,438
- Talk to Beth?
- I gotta undo what I did.

210
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,757
You're not undoing anything.

211
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,918
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Oh, no, you're not.

212
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,759
All right, get out of my way.

213
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,801
All right, don't make me
get physical here!

214
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:36,725
You be careful, George.

215
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,325
- George.
- Hi, Beth.

216
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,882
Anyway, Jerry told me that...

217
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,517
...it might have been my comment
in the coffee shop that broke you up.

218
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,365
Well, you know,
it's funny, George...

219
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,280
...sometimes you don't know
how you're feeling about something...

220
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,484
...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.

221
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,039
Articulate?

222
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:18,366
Me? I've never articulated anything.
I'm completely incoherent.

223
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,599
I don't know about that.

224
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,361
Hold on. Hello.

225
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,960
Hi.

226
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,119
Yeah, last night. I did too.

227
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,165
Really? That's so funny,
he's here right now.

228
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,079
Can you put him on?
I'd love to say hello.

229
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,920
Sure. George, it's Jerry.

230
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,958
- He wants to talk to me?
- Yeah.

231
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,244
- He says he wants to say hello.
- Sweet guy.

232
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,439
Hello?

233
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,485
What the hell are you doing
over there?

234
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,081
Mind your own business.
Now, stay out of my affairs!

235
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,078
Jerry, Jerry,
that is so sweet of you...

236
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,238
...but actually, I already ate.

237
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,159
Ate? What the hell
are you talking about?

238
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,124
Listen to me.
Get out of that apartment.

239
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,956
- Lf you screw this up for me, I swear...
- Chocolate chip mint?

240
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,477
Actually, Jerry,
I prefer chocolate chip.

241
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:10,842
What is it about the chocolate
and the mint...

242
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,202
...that makes it go so well together?

243
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,445
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, of course you can use it. Sure.

244
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,043
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Don't hang up on me, George, I...

245
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,763
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,202
Are you still wearing those things?

247
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,516
Oh, yeah.

248
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,247
Yeah, I think they're starting
to loosen up a bit.

249
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,047
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Zanfino.
- Kramer, would you do me a favour?

250
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:41,244
My babysitter hasn't shown up.
Could you watch Joey for an hour?

251
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,442
Yeah, sure, Mrs. Zanfino.

252
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,201
He's sleeping already.
You don't have to do anything.

253
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,882
- See you later, buddy.
- See you later.

254
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,598
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry. It's Beth.

255
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,644
- Oh, hi, Beth.
- Hi.

256
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,838
I've been doing
a lot of thinking today...

257
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,760
...and I don't know,
maybe I made a huge mistake.

258
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,159
- George.
- I'm just feeling very confused.

259
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,799
- I'll call you back, okay?
- Okay.

260
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:09,836
- Trouble.
- What?

261
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,326
- George. Yeah.
- Is it? Damn.

262
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,920
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

263
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,998
You get your ass
over to Beth's tout de suite.

264
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,635
Turn on some of that so-called charm
you tell me about.

265
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,084
- Yeah, I can try and do that.
- You don't try, you do it.

266
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,284
I got the loser in this relationship.
I'm breathing new life into him.

267
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,007
Give me three more days,
he won't remember her name.

268
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,680
You got the winner, the easy part.

269
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,923
Let's go. I'll drive you over there.
Come on.

270
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,920
- You go on ahead. I'll take the bus.
- What? I'm parked outside.

271
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,521
- I'll take the subway.
- It doesn't matter. I'll take you.

272
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,325
- I can hitchhike.
- What's your problem?

273
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,523
- It's really not necessary.
- What's your problem?

274
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,879
The...

275
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,322
The shoelaces
that you bought me...

276
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,398
...they worked out well.

277
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,915
Well, you know,
if you need some more...

278
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,078
...I can get them for you.

279
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:10,636
It should be a while, though.

280
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:18,804
That was close.

281
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,319
Confide in her. Open up to her.

282
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,681
You know, women like that.

283
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:27,203
I don't feel so good.

284
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,241
Anyway, Beth...

285
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:31,318
You know, I was thinking
on my way over...

286
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,684
...how when I was 9,
I wanted these handball sneakers.

287
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,200
They were all black.

288
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,756
But they only came in adult sizes.

289
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,925
So, you know,
I never got the sneakers.

290
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,406
Oh, really?

291
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,797
My father left us when I was 9...

292
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,562
...so I guess that's why
I have such a fear of abandonment.

293
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:56,844
- Wow, that's so touching.
- Yes, it is.

294
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:00,921
Hey, it's George.

295
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,396
Oh, maybe we should go
someplace else.

296
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,761
No, let's go in.

297
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,636
- Oh, hi. Hi, David.
- Hi, George.

298
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,763
- Elaine.
- Hi.

299
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:18,044
Listen, David, I want to apologize
about that comment...

300
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,437
George, please, please. I'm fine.

301
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,199
Oh, yeah, this is my fiancée.

302
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,005
- Susan, this is David.
- David.

303
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,722
Oh, fiancée? Boy, you could've
done a lot better than him.

304
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,437
Come on, Elaine, let's go.

305
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,281
It's Frankenstein! It's Frankenstein!

306
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,960
Joey.

307
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,041
Joey.

308
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:10,042
Mickey, you were so incredible
in that scene yesterday.

309
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,925
- The rage.
- Right.

310
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,964
The rage. Tons of rage.

311
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,324
I don't believe this.

312
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,481
- Hello.
- Mickey.

313
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:24,796
Oh, hi, Kramer.

314
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:27,561
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- You gotta do me a favour.

315
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,321
- What? Now? I can't.
- Hey, you owe me.

316
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,880
I got you in the Actors Studio.

317
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,719
They thought what we did
was the scene.

318
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,196
All right, all right. I'll be right over.

319
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,280
You ready?

320
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,684
You know what, George...

321
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,678
...why don't you go ahead.

322
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,607
I think I'd like
to be alone for a while.

323
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh, sure.

324
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,321
Sure, you want to be alone?
Sure, I understand that.

325
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,842
You want a little time to think?
Think. Ponder things.

326
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,725
You know, ruminate.

327
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,639
You go ahead.
A lot of stuff on your mind.

328
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,035
You think things out. Think.

329
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,517
Mull, just mull. Do a lot of mulling.

330
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,035
I gotta go find this kid.

331
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,675
All you gotta do is lay here
and pretend you're asleep...

332
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,644
...in case she gets back.
Here, the covers.

333
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,037
Why don't you just cut the pants
and get them off.

334
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,767
- I'm breaking them in.
- What am I gonna do in here?

335
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,521
Just keep the lights out
and your eyes closed. I'll be back.

336
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,123
Jerry, Jerry!

337
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,246
Jerry, Jerry, the most
unbelievable thing has happened.

338
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,556
It is so unbelievable!

339
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,036
I'm sitting in the coffee shop,
I'm talking to Susan...

340
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,925
...we're talking
about shoelaces... right?

341
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,000
So in walks David, right?
He walks right up to the table, right?

342
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,806
I introduce him to Susan,
and he says... Now, get this.

343
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,527
He says, " Boy, you could do
a lot better than this guy."

344
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,323
He said the exact same thing
that I said to him...

345
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:46,681
...just to get back at me.

346
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:51,557
And then she says she wants
to be alone for a while. Alone, Jerry.

347
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:55,163
I think that she thinks
that she could do better.

348
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,760
Do you appreciate this?

349
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,201
You see the irony of this?

350
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,880
You see what's going on here?

351
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,556
What's the matter?

352
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,558
I'm nauseous.

353
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,319
That what's hurting
your appreciation?

354
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,556
A little.

355
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,240
It's a good story,
don't you think?

356
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,396
- It's not bad.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,797
Joey, there you are. Hey, Joey!

358
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,559
It's a monster!

359
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,797
I'm the babysitter.

360
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,165
Good night, honey.

361
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,160
Good night.

362
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,035
It's gotta have
something to do with Kramer.

363
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,081
Elaine...

364
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,725
...here's to you being there.

365
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,559
And here.

366
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,279
Excuse me.

367
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,199
- Beth.
- David.

368
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,966
I'll tell you, it's not bad.

369
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,206
- George?
- Yeah?

370
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,598
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

371
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,086
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the wedding and all...

372
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,559
...and I've decided
to go with the chicken.

373
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,486
So chasing little kids, huh?
You're in a lot of trouble, mister.

374
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:19,155
- No, look, I was babysitting...
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

375
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,885
Sit down.

376
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:29,037
What are you, deaf?
I said, sit down.

377
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:38,000
- Hey, for the last time, sit down.
- Oh, yeah.
