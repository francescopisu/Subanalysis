1
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:05,644
Every morning, when you wake up,
it's like you're born all over again.

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,203
You can't see, you can't talk.

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:12,439
You're on your way to the bathroom
trying to remember, "How do I walk?"

4
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,120
Like you've never
been alive before.

5
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,960
But if any invention marks
the decline of human civilization...

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:18,845
...it would have to be
the snooze alarm.

7
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:20,679
The snooze alarm
is based on the idea...

8
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:23,600
...that when the alarm goes off,
you are not getting up.

9
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,201
You're not even awake,
you're already a failure.

10
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:29,279
They should sell the snooze alarm
with an unemployment application...

11
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,721
...and a bottle of tequila.

12
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:34,357
Just make it a complete
pathetic-loser kit.

13
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,402
- Hello.
- This is your wak e-up service.

14
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,956
It's 7:15.

15
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:53,402
Oh, God.

16
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,957
Oh, I could use
a few more hours sleep.

17
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:00,244
- Hot date last night?
- I wish.

18
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,045
A woman with a sexy v oice
lik e yours...

19
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,846
...it's hard to believe
you're waking up alone.

20
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,725
Really?

21
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:09,081
Thank you...

22
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:12,922
...Tri-State Wake-Up Service
person.

23
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:17,558
- Call me James.
- Oh, all right, James.

24
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:22,159
The wake-up guy asked you out?

25
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,476
Yeah, I've never seen him...

26
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,844
...but I feel like we have
this weirdly intimate relationship.

27
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,157
You know, I mean, I'm lying in bed.

28
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:31,124
I'm wearing my nightie.

29
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,606
I don't know. A blind date?

30
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,806
You wanna go out with
my cousin Holly. You've never met her.

31
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,559
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.

32
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,285
At least I've spoken to my guy.

33
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,677
You're going out on a deaf date.

34
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:44,202
I think I'd rather go on a deaf date
than a blind date.

35
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:47,325
The question is, would you rather
date the blind or the deaf?

36
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,523
- Now, you're off on a topic.
- That's interesting.

37
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:52,679
See, now, I think
I would rather date the deaf.

38
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,041
Because I think the blind...

39
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,596
...would probably be
a little messy around the house.

40
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,839
I mean, let's face it,
they're not gonna get all the crumbs.

41
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,043
You're constantly
walking around with a sponge.

42
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,316
See, I disagree.
I would rather date the blind.

43
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,957
You know, you could let the house go,
you let yourself go.

44
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,841
A good-looking blind woman...

45
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,077
...doesn't know
you're not good enough for her.

46
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,477
I think she'd figure it out
soon enough.

47
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,120
What?

48
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:20,766
What is this?

49
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,487
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.

50
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,525
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?
What are you turning into?

51
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,643
A healthy person.

52
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,882
- You squirted me.
- Oh, sorry.

53
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,117
Boy, that stings.

54
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:40,197
George, have you seen Morgan?

55
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,723
- No.
- He's been coming in later and later.

56
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:46,516
- Is there something wrong?
- No, not that I know of.

57
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,205
Really?

58
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,641
Well, make sure he signs this.

59
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,480
George, if there's a problem
with Morgan, you can tell me.

60
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:56,115
Morgan? No, he's doing a great job.

61
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,206
I understand.

62
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,196
I still can't believe
you're going out on a blind date.

63
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,676
I'm not worried.
He sounds like he's good-looking.

64
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,360
You're going by sound?
What are we, whales?

65
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,601
I think I can tell.

66
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,837
What percentage of people
are good-looking?

67
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,521
- Twenty-five percent.
- Twenty-five percent?

68
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,121
No way. It's like 4 to 6 percent.

69
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,606
It's a 20-1 shot.

70
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,405
- You're way off.
- Way off?

71
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:26,116
You been to the Motor Vehicle Bureau?
It's a leper colony down there.

72
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,764
So basically, what you're saying...

73
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:31,236
...is 95 percent of the population
is undateable?

74
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,045
Undateable.

75
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,163
Then how are all these people
getting together?

76
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,840
Alcohol.

77
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:38,481
What is your problem?

78
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,683
No problem here.

79
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,122
You keep winking at me.
That's really obnoxious.

80
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:47,720
- I had no idea.
- Right there. You just did it again.

81
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,675
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

82
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,917
It's from that grapefruit
Jerry squirted at me.

83
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,406
Oh, your eye still hurts?

84
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,037
Yeah, yeah, you must have squirted
a piece of pulp in it too.

85
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,845
Pulp couldn't make it
across the table.

86
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,123
Pulp can move, baby.

87
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,120
Why can't you eat a real breakfast?

88
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:06,006
I eat healthy. If I have to take out
an eye, that's the breaks.

89
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,521
Wait a minute. I must have
been winking down at the office.

90
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:12,042
That's why Mr. Wilhelm
was acting so misterioso.

91
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:16,080
What did he think,
you were flirting with him?

92
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,322
No, he thought I was hiding
something about Morgan.

93
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,843
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Jughead.

94
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:26,317
Hello, Archie, Veronica,
Mr. Weatherbee.

95
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:29,886
Hey.

96
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,517
- Is this Don Mattingly's signature?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:33,881
And Buck Showalter's?

98
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,323
It's an interoffice envelope. It gets
passed around all over the office.

99
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,159
Hey, can I show this
to my buddy Stubs?

100
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,840
He runs a sports-memorabilia store.

101
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,679
He'll pay top-dollar
for pro autographs.

102
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,126
Yeah, like I'm gonna risk my job
with the New York Yankees...

103
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,800
...to make a few extra bucks.

104
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,320
No, of course not.

105
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,836
No, you see, Don Mattingly
signed this envelope.

106
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,804
Then he sent it to room 318...

107
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,243
...where it was received and signed for
by manager Buck Showalter.

108
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,398
I don't know. An envelope?

109
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,285
- It doesn't really cut it.
- Why?

110
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,325
And what is this?

111
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,443
A birthday card.

112
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:11,883
Signed by the entire
Yankee organization?

113
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,005
This could be worth something.

114
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,877
- Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
- Hello.

115
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,605
You got that birthday card?

116
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,360
- Birthday card?
- Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card.

117
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,324
Wilhelm said you'd have it
for me to sign.

118
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:29,366
Oh, yeah. I'll have that for you
right after lunch.

119
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:33,076
- Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
- Of course, your massage.

120
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,397
Enjoy your massage.

121
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,399
- Hello?
- Elaine?

122
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:52,157
- James.
- Yes.

123
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,118
Hello.

124
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,558
I can't believe Elaine's
never taken you here.

125
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,399
I'm really not
much of a meat eater.

126
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,282
You don't eat meat?

127
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,881
- What are you, one of those...?
- No, I'm not one of those.

128
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,961
When we were little girls...

129
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,721
...Grandma Mema would take us
to a matinee and dinner here.

130
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,765
- Grandma Mema?
- Elaine must have mentioned Mema.

131
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,758
No, I think I would have
remembered Mema.

132
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,521
Oh, well, that's typical.
Elaine never liked Grandma Mema.

133
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,121
Ready?

134
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,484
I'll have the porterhouse, medium rare,
baked potato with sour cream.

135
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,759
What do you recommended
besides a steak?

136
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,679
The lamb chops are good.

137
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,839
Anything lighter?
How do you prepare the chicken?

138
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:37,158
It's a full bird, stuffed with ham,
topped with Gorgonzola.

139
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,046
You know, I'll just have a salad.

140
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,879
Thank you.

141
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,526
Just a salad.

142
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,166
Just a salad.

143
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:49,680
Just a salad.

144
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,439
Here you are. Hey, boys.

145
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,245
Hey, you. Hey, you. Hi.

146
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,441
These are your dogs?

147
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,882
Yeah, when you live alone,
your dogs are all you have.

148
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,765
Do you like dogs?

149
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:05,361
Shut up, you stupid little mutt!

150
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:10,285
- Dogs? Oh, I love dogs.
- Boys, this is Elaine.

151
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,916
I'm sorry.
They're usually very friendly.

152
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,486
Hey.

153
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,157
Hey, Mr. Morgan,
how was your massage?

154
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,160
I had to cancel it. For some reason
my wife got it into her head...

155
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,999
...that it was more
than just a massage.

156
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,036
- Really?
- We got into this big fight at lunch.

157
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,801
- I'll be sleeping on the couch.
- Listen, don't oversleep.

158
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,844
- You can't afford to be late again.
- I know.

159
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:38,716
Somebody's been giving Wilhelm
the impression I've been slacking off.

160
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey, you know, you should try
my friend's wake-up service.

161
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,560
She's swears by this thing.

162
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,399
You may be my only friend
around here.

163
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,604
- By the way, you got that card?
- Not yet.

164
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,962
Make sure Steinbrenner
doesn't get it till I sign it.

165
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,116
Yes, sir.

166
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,079
I mean, I just don't understand it.

167
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:57,045
As soon as I met these dogs,
they started growling at me.

168
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:01,120
Well, maybe his dogs heard about
how you tried to kidnap that other dog.

169
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,676
These mutts like to gossip.

170
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:05,081
So have you talked to Holly?

171
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,560
Did she mention our lunch?

172
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,756
- Kind of.
- Well, what do you mean, "Kind of"?

173
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:15,560
I mean, she thought it was
kind of strange to just order a salad.

174
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,437
You know, for a man.

175
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,523
Like a quiche thing?

176
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,919
You're in the ballpark.

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,600
Salad? What was I thinking?

178
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,439
Women don't respect salad eaters.

179
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,199
You got that right.

180
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,927
You're going over there
for dinner tonight, right?

181
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:37,080
- What is she making?
- I don't know. I'm sure it had parents.

182
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,765
Call her up.
She won't mind if you come.

183
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,317
Oh, don't worry, I'll be there.
And I'll be packing an artery.

184
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,204
Well, Mr. Weatherbee.

185
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,446
Do you have
that Yankee envelope?

186
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,320
I sure do.

187
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:56,560
- There you are.
- Hey.

188
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:59,400
Think you're gonna be very pleased
when you see what's inside.

189
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,717
- What is this?
- Your cut of the loot.

190
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,081
Stubs gave me $200...

191
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,556
...for the autographed birthday card
that was inside.

192
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,240
Who told you to sell the card?

193
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,281
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

194
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,675
Well, not in so many words...

195
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,361
...but I believe
we had an understanding.

196
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,085
I was not winking, you idiot.

197
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,203
That was the grapefruit.
It's like acid.

198
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,165
I need that card back.
It's Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.

199
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:28,285
Well, Stubs sold it to some guy
whose kid is in the hospital.

200
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,245
Well, get it back.
It's very important.

201
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,439
Look, you want me
to get it back or not?

202
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,356
Get it back!

203
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:41,399
This is such a lovely
table setting, Holly.

204
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,206
- Where did you get these napkins?
- They were Grandma Mema's.

205
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,519
- I don't remember them.
- You wouldn't.

206
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,201
She only used them
on special occasions.

207
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,887
Special occasions? It wasn't special
when my family visited?

208
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,607
Everybody like mutton?

209
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,039
Mutton.

210
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,196
Hope you didn't cut the fat off.

211
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,637
- Are you Bobby?
- Yes.

212
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,204
Well, I heard that you have
a very special birthday card...

213
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,437
...with all the Yankee
autographs on it.

214
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,838
- Sure do, mister.
- Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah.

215
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,202
Boy, Stubs sure went to town
with this thing, huh?

216
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,562
Yeah, well, Bobby,
what if I told you...

217
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:23,161
...that a very important person
at the New York Yankees...

218
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:24,555
...needed this card back?

219
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:28,402
Oh, no. I'd never part with this card
for anything in the world.

220
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,081
Well, Bobby...

221
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,641
- Who's your favourite Yankee?
- Paul O'Neill.

222
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,719
What if I get Paul O'Neill
to hit a home run just for you?

223
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,084
- Really? Paul O'Neill would do that?
- For you, he would.

224
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,919
Could he hit two home runs?

225
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,520
Two?

226
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,565
Sure, kid. But then you gotta promise
you'll do something for me.

227
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:50,685
I know. Get out of this bed one day
and walk again.

228
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,236
Yeah, that would be nice,
but I just need the card.

229
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,161
What about this candelabra?

230
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,079
That was Grandma Mema's also.

231
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,238
She bought it on her trip to Europe
in 1926.

232
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,164
Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton.
I was afraid you only ate salad.

233
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,605
Hey, salad's got nothing
on this mutton.

234
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,364
That is so funny.
Did you just make that up?

235
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,119
I wish I could take credit for it.

236
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,882
It's actually a line my butcher uses
when we're chewing the fat.

237
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,038
How about that beautiful desk
over there?

238
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,086
Yeah, that was in Mema's study.

239
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:30,999
I love that desk.

240
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,397
What did you do,
ransack the place after she died?

241
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,797
This is some fine mutton.

242
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,878
You know what?
I'm getting out of here.

243
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,840
Can I borrow your jacket?

244
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,237
- Well, the thing is...
- It's cold out, okay?

245
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:44,125
I didn't bring my own, okay? Jerry.

246
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,879
Jerry!

247
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,958
God forbid I should
borrow one from Holly.

248
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,357
It might have belonged
to Grandma Mema.

249
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,400
Thanks for mutton.

250
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,682
Nice doggy.

251
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,166
I'm a nice person.

252
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:03,646
Don't believe what you hear.

253
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,561
I love dogs. I really do.

254
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,801
- Where are the napkins?
- What?

255
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:14,039
Grandma Mema's napkins.
Two are missing.

256
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,521
Elaine took them, didn't she?

257
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,958
I don't know about that.

258
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,880
- Have you got any floss?
- You heard her. She coveted them.

259
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,958
I bet she took them just to spite me.

260
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:26,197
She's probably having a laugh
about it right now.

261
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,124
Down, doggy!

262
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:42,725
What are you doing
in this neighbourhood?

263
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,242
- Did you hide the dogs?
- Yeah, they're in the kitchen.

264
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:49,562
It's okay. Okay. Quiet!

265
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,961
- What's going on?
- Oh, God.

266
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:53,355
These dogs were chasing me.

267
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:54,676
And no cabs were stopping.

268
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,315
I had to get off the street.
I remembered you lived here.

269
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:58,840
Why were dogs chasing you?

270
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,202
They just don't like me.
It's a long story.

271
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,722
I can tell you about it someday,
but not right now.

272
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,762
I would ask you to stay, but I only have
the sofa bed, and it's where I sleep.

273
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,638
Well, we'll have to sleep
head-to-toe.

274
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,037
- Head-to-toe?
- Head-to-toe.

275
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,917
Hey, wake up.

276
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,280
It's 8:30. You were supposed
to wake me up at 7: 15.

277
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,122
I'm sorry. I didn't get any sleep.
You kept kicking me in the face.

278
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,437
You're a wake-up guy.
Don't you have calls to make?

279
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,757
I'll make them later.

280
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,519
- Have you seen Morgan?
- He's not here?

281
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:01,881
No, he's late again.

282
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,003
That's impossible.
I got him a wake-up service.

283
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,646
You don't have to cover for him.

284
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:06,922
He's gonna be gone soon...

285
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,521
...and I'm gonna recommended you
for his job.

286
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:10,961
Gone?

287
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,557
Sounds like all that winking
got you a promotion.

288
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,287
I don't want Morgan's job.
He's got a lot of work to do.

289
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,961
Hey, Elaine, your friend
never woke up Mr. Morgan.

290
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,243
Yeah, well, he was tired.
He had feet in his face.

291
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,081
My cousin Holly
is completely insane.

292
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,444
She keeps calling and accusing me
of stealing her napkins.

293
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,359
- Napkins?
- I mean, why?

294
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,279
Why would I take
her stupid napkins?

295
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,325
Because they were in the pockets
of my jacket.

296
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:36,681
- They were?
- Yes.

297
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:39,441
I was using them
to spit out the mutton.

298
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,685
You spit it out?

299
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,078
I had dogs chasing me for that.

300
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,367
I was almost mauled
because of that mutton.

301
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,245
- What exactly is mutton?
- I don't know.

302
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,443
And I didn't wanna find out.

303
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,040
So where's my jacket?

304
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,246
I must have left it at James'.

305
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,637
Spent the night at James', did we?

306
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:02,526
Yeah, but we reversed positions,
so there was no funny business.

307
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,364
- Reversed positions?
- Yeah, you know, head-to-toe.

308
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,317
So what?
Your genitals are still lined up.

309
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:16,121
No, because I slept
with my back to him.

310
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:23,755
- Mr. O'Neill?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:25,679
Yeah, look, you don't know me.

312
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,758
All right. I can give you
an autograph here...

313
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,966
...but my pen's kind of screwed up and
you'll probably only get, like, half a P.

314
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,322
No, it's not that.
It's about a boy in the hospital.

315
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:37,206
I was wondering if you could
do something to lift his spirits.

316
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,439
- I can help you there.
- I promised you'd hit two home runs.

317
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,962
- You what?
- Yeah, you know, a couple of dingers.

318
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,721
You promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit two home runs?

319
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,196
- Yeah, what? No good?
- No, it's no good. It's terrible.

320
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,846
You don't hit home runs like that.

321
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,362
It's hard to hit home runs.
Where did you get two from?

322
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,358
Well, two is better than one.

323
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,757
That's ridiculous.
I'm not a home-run hitter.

324
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,997
- Well, Babe Ruth did it.
- He did not.

325
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,919
You're saying
that Babe Ruth was a liar?

326
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:04,204
I'm not calling him a liar, but he wasn't
stupid enough to promise two.

327
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,517
Well, maybe I did
overextend myself.

328
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,279
How did you get in here anyway?

329
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:14,716
Oh, hi, Elaine. You know, I lost
all of my 6:30 clients because of you.

330
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:18,038
Yeah, well, why did you
have to stick your feet in my face?

331
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:21,246
Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on.

332
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,446
Fellas.

333
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,440
What do you got?

334
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,124
The Yank ees tak e the field
on a beautiful afternoon.

335
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,323
It's hot in here.

336
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:37,081
Hey, Bobby,
can I have some of your juice?

337
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,877
After Paul O'Neill
hits his first home run.

338
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:47,806
- Yeah?
- It's Holly.

339
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:52,438
- Come on up.
- And the two-and-one pitch to O'Neill.

340
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,917
Towering shot to deep right field,
and it's gone!

341
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,800
- Yeah!
- A home run for Paul O'Neill.

342
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,403
- The Yanks lead 1-nothing.
- Oh, yeah!

343
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,319
All right.

344
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,715
Yeah.

345
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,475
One more to go.

346
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,604
Hey, what's all this?

347
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,997
I decided I'm gonna
make you dinner.

348
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,646
Oh, I thought we were going out.

349
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,365
After you scarfed up my mutton...

350
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,200
...I had the irresistible urge
to make pork chops for you.

351
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,559
Well, I said hello to Franco for you.

352
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,836
- Franco?
- Your butcher down the street.

353
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,323
I bet he acted all aloof
like he didn't know me.

354
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:35,082
- A little.
- That is so Franco.

355
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:38,844
Bottom of the eighth.
Score tied at 1 apiece.

356
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,475
Two and one to Paul O'Neill.

357
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:45,401
Bobby, it's hard to hit two home runs
in one game, even for Paul O'Neill.

358
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,046
He can do it, Mr. Kramer.

359
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,562
I know he can. He'll do it for me.

360
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:55,639
Long fly ball into deep left field,
and it drops just over Belle's head.

361
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,958
O'Neill's rounding second,
the ball rolling back to the wall.

362
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:01,038
- O'Neill heading for third.
- Come on!

363
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:03,880
O'Neill rounds third,
being waved in.

364
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,241
Yeah! Go! Go!

365
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:08,843
And Martinez throws it
over Alomar's head.

366
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:12,283
O'Neill is safe at home,
the Yank ees tak e the lead.

367
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,964
Inside-the-park home run!

368
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:18,036
- Yes, he did it.
- All right.

369
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:19,799
Yeah, well,
I guess I'll be on my way.

370
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,959
Now, that's being scored
a triple for Paul O'Neill...

371
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:26,403
...with a throwing error
charged to Martinez.

372
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:27,761
Hey.

373
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,406
That's not a home run.

374
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,046
Well, maybe not technically, but...

375
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,004
You said he would hit
two home runs.

376
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,635
Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good.

377
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,799
- Well, you're not taking that card.
- Now, Bobby, Bobby. We had a deal.

378
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,242
Come on, give me that.

379
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,967
So is the chop
the way you like it?

380
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,197
I usually like mine
with an angioplasty.

381
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,278
Something really stinks to high...

382
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,358
Holly.

383
00:18:58,527 --> 00:18:59,721
What are you doing here?

384
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,878
What everyone does here.
Cooking pork chops.

385
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,677
Listen, I'm meeting James here.

386
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,360
He's bringing over your jacket.

387
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,324
- And what about the napkins?
- Oh, God.

388
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,205
I didn't take your napkins.

389
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,562
- Then who did?
- Ask Jerry.

390
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:15,002
Hey, we can argue all night
over who took the napkins.

391
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:19,080
The point is, in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.

392
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,681
I still wanna know what happened
to that birthday card.

393
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:26,203
- Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
- No, sir. George never gave it to me.

394
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,561
That's right. I didn't.

395
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:30,321
I take full responsibility
for the card not being here, l...

396
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:32,603
- I got it.
- What's this?

397
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:35,725
Oh, it's a birthday card. Yeah.

398
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,125
George, by the way,
tomorrow night...

399
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,881
...Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.

400
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,875
George, this is beautiful.

401
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:47,322
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna have it mounted?

402
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,206
Yeah, you were probably
just gonna stick it in an envelope.

403
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,806
George, keep up the good work.

404
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,205
Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.

405
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,164
How am I supposed
to sign the card now, huh?

406
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,646
It's already under glass.

407
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,280
Hi, James. Oh, this is...

408
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,327
Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?

409
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,796
Oh, bandanas. Aren't they cute?

410
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,197
You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?

411
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,046
Hey, what happened to my jacket?

412
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,437
Oh, the dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.

413
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,802
Somebody stuffed
some strange meat in the pockets.

414
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,561
- Was it mutton?
- Could have been.

415
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,718
You always stuff
meat in your pockets?

416
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,116
Sometimes I use the sofa.

417
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:37,646
You wanted to see me?

418
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,604
Yes, George.
Please, come in, come in.

419
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,042
Thanks for the card. I loved it.
It made me feel good.

420
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,277
Word has it you were
the brains behind the thing.

421
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:46,881
No, no, not just me.
The whole organization.

422
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,241
Especially Mr. Morgan.

423
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,967
Morgan, Morgan. You know,
his name is absent from this card.

424
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,924
Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.

425
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,759
Oh, no, Morgan is a good man, sir.

426
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,077
You can stop.
Congratulations, you've got his job.

427
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,604
Well, thank you, sir. You know,
I'm not quite sure I'm right for it.

428
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,439
It's done, George.
He's out, you're in.

429
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:03,960
- It's a lot more work.
- I know.

430
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,560
A lot more responsibility.

431
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,365
- Long, long hours.
- I know.

432
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,006
Not much more money.

433
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,635
But you'll finally
get the recognition you deserve.

434
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,035
That's what I'm afraid of.

435
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,356
You know, Mr. Steinbrenner...

436
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:17,758
George, as painful as it is, I've had
to let a few people go over the years.

437
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,566
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella...

438
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,321
...Bucky Dent, Billy Martin...

439
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:24,806
...Dallas Green...

440
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,798
...Dick Hauser, Bill Virdon...

441
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,480
...Billy Martin...

442
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,797
...Stump Merrill, Billy Martin...

443
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,242
...Bob Lemon, Billy Martin...

444
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,477
...Gene Michael, Buck Showalter...

445
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,558
George, you didn't hear that
from me.

446
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,365
George!
