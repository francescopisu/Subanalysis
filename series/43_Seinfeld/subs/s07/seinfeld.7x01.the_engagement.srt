1
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,845
Well, you got no place to go.

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,756
Your problem is you brought
your queen out too fast.

3
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:17,837
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?

4
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:23,447
No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,996
Take care of her man.
Make sure he feels good.

6
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:30,879
Checkmate.

7
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,160
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

8
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,686
Shut up!

9
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:03,319
Shut up, you stupid mutt!

10
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,036
You broke up with her
because she beat you at chess?

11
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,196
That's pretty sick.

12
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:11,757
I don't see how I could perform
sexually after something like that.

13
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,800
I was completely emasculated.

14
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,525
Anyway, it's not the only reason.

15
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:18,962
- Yeah, what else?
- All right.

16
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,687
You wanna know what
one of her favourite expressions is:

17
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,758
"Happy, pappy?"

18
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:26,000
"Happy, pappy?"
What does that mean?

19
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,886
If she wants to know if I'm pleased
with something, she'll say:

20
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,560
"Happy, pappy?"

21
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:32,715
- Oh, you're pappy.
- I'm pappy.

22
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:35,447
- Oh, I get it. I see.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,322
- So that's not so bad.
- Come on. What, are you kidding?

24
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:39,840
So tell her not to say it.

25
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,245
I'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.

26
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,162
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...

27
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,363
...because she shushed you
while you watched TV.

28
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,087
Hey, I got a real thing
about shushing.

29
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,846
What is this?

30
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:58,556
You ever get the feeling like you had
a haircut, but you didn't have one?

31
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:01,002
I'm all itchy back here.

32
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:08,122
- What?
- What is this?

33
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:09,606
What are we doing?

34
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,083
What in God's name are we doing?

35
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:14,920
- What?
- Our lives.

36
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,078
What kind of lives are these?

37
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:21,957
- We're like children. We're not men.
- No, we're not. We're not men.

38
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,880
We come up with all these stupid
reasons to break up with women.

39
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,277
I know, I know. That's what I do.
That's what I do.

40
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,525
Are we gonna be sitting here
when we're 60, like two idiots?

41
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:34,076
We should be having dinner
with our sons when we're 60.

42
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:38,365
- We're pathetic, you know that?
- Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

43
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:42,076
- Why can't I be normal?
- Yes, me too.

44
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,522
I wanna be normal. Normal!

45
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,803
It would be nice
to care about someone.

46
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,004
Yes. Yes, care.

47
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,557
You know who I think about a lot?

48
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,681
Remember Susan,
the one that used to work for NBC?

49
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,963
I thought she became a lesbian.

50
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,919
No, it didn't take.

51
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,044
Did I tell you I ran into her last week?
She looked great.

52
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,596
You thought she was
good-looking, right?

53
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,486
See, there you go again.
What is the difference what I think?

54
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,525
- I was just curious.
- Well, this is it.

55
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,757
I'm really gonna do something
about my life.

56
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,725
I think I'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

57
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,321
George, I am really
gonna make some changes.

58
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,603
- Yes, changes.
- I'm serious about it.

59
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,120
- Think I'm not?
- I'm not kidding.

60
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,959
Me too.

61
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,478
Melanie, you can shush me
at every opportunity.

62
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,803
So we're all straightened out?

63
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,878
You happy, pappy?

64
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:43,402
Oh, it's just an expression.

65
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:48,320
All right. That's very sweet of you.
Okay, I'll call you later. All right. Bye.

66
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,682
Hey.

67
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:55,205
Well, I had a very interesting lunch
with George Costanza today.

68
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,164
- Really?
- We were talking about our lives...

69
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,636
...and we both kind of realized...

70
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,002
...we're kids. We're not men.

71
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,284
So then you asked yourselves,
"Isn't there something more to life?"

72
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:07,438
Yes, we did.

73
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,677
Yeah. Well, let me clue you in
on something:

74
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,121
There isn't.

75
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,435
- There isn't?
- Absolutely not.

76
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:21,156
I mean, what are you thinking
about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?

77
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,116
- Well...
- They're prisons.

78
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:27,438
Man-made prisons. You're doing time.

79
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,837
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

80
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,759
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

81
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:35,237
It's like you gotta ask permission
to use the bathroom.

82
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:39,036
"Is it all right
if I use the bathroom now?"

83
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,443
- Really?
- You can forget about watching TV...

84
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,438
...while you're eating.

85
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,326
- I can?
- Oh, yeah!

86
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,638
You know why?
Because it's dinnertime.

87
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,718
- And you know what you do at dinner?
- What?

88
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,163
You talk about your day.

89
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,396
"How was your day today?

90
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,320
Did you have a good day or
a bad day? What kind of day was it?"

91
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,320
"I don't know. How about you?
How was your day?"

92
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,758
- Boy.
- It's sad, Jerry.

93
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,645
It's a sad state of affairs.

94
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:10,245
- I'm glad we had this talk.
- Oh, you have no idea.

95
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,635
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,480
Three hours of sleep again last night.

97
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,923
Three hours of sleep
because of that dog.

98
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:54,482
- What dog?
- Why don't you call the police?

99
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,684
- I did, Jerry. They won't do anything.
- Yeah. What dog?

100
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:01,601
There is this dog in the courtyard
across from my bedroom window...

101
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,156
...that never, ever stops barking.

102
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,686
I lost my voice
just screaming at this thing.

103
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,315
I can't sleep. I can't work.

104
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,796
I mean, I just moved.
I can't move again.

105
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,845
What am I gonna do? What?
What am I gonna do?

106
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:19,477
- Well, there is something you can do.
- What? Kramer, I'll do anything.

107
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,765
Well, what if there should be
an unfortunate accident?

108
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,439
You're gonna rub out the dog?

109
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,719
No, no. Not me.

110
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,957
I just happen to know someone
who specializes...

111
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,961
...in exactly these kinds
of sticky situations.

112
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,319
What, you're considering this?

113
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:45,799
Just meet with him. See what he has
to say. You got nothing to lose.

114
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,080
L... I don't really know why I'm here.
Kramer talked me into coming here...

115
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,841
...but obviously I could never
really do anything.

116
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,924
Of course.

117
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,521
Obviously.

118
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,725
Well, so anyway,
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

119
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,845
What kind of dog did you say it was?

120
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:14,167
- I don't know. I've never really seen it.
- I see many dogs on my mail route.

121
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:17,683
I'll bet there's not one type of mutt
or mongrel I haven't run across.

122
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:21,396
If you ask me, they have no business
living amongst us. Vile, useless...

123
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,081
Newman! Newman!

124
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:25,760
Stop it.

125
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,036
- Anyway.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,719
Well, I was just curious...

127
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:36,915
...if I were interested
in availing myself of your services...

128
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,918
...what exactly would you do?

129
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,522
Well, Elaine...

130
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:46,478
...there's any number of things
that I could do.

131
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:48,797
But I can promise you this, though:

132
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,243
This vicious beast
will never bother you again.

133
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,601
So, what's it gonna be?

134
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,483
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog.

135
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,241
- I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
- Wait a minute. I got it.

136
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:02,843
We'll kidnap it. We'll kidnap the dog,
we'll drop him off upstate.

137
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,362
Then he won't bother you anymore
and he won't get hurt.

138
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,836
Yeah, I suppose.

139
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,165
I'd have to think about it.
I doubt it, though. I'll let you know.

140
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,363
Of course, take your time.

141
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,916
I'll be here.

142
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,838
All right. Let's do it.

143
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,959
Excellent.

144
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,878
Excellent.

145
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,556
How come you eat your peas
one at a time?

146
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,843
Well, what's the hurry?

147
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,841
Who is it?

148
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,884
- It's George.
- George?

149
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:46,081
George, what is it?

150
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,676
Will you marry me?

151
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,558
- Hello?
- Ma, guess what?

152
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:04,083
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's nothing bad.

153
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,442
- I'm getting married!
- You what?

154
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,316
- I'm getting married!
- Oh, my God. You're getting married?

155
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,239
- Yes.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

156
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,967
- Frank, come here.
- You come here.

157
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,357
- Georgie's getting married.
- What?

158
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,166
- Georgie's getting married!
- Get the hell out of here.

159
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,646
- He's getting married?
- Yes.

160
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:23,718
- To a woman?
- Of course a woman.

161
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,036
What does she look lik e?

162
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,435
I'm sure she's gorgeous.

163
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,041
- What differences does it make?
- Is she pretty?

164
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,959
Yes. What difference does to make?

165
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,401
I'm just curious!

166
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,797
- She's not pretty?
- Let me talk to her.

167
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,195
She wants to talk to you.

168
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,837
- Hello?
- Congratulations.

169
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,044
I just want you to know
that I love your son very much.

170
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:45,356
- You do?
- Yes.

171
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:46,721
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:49,640
- May I ask why?
- Okay, let me talk to her.

173
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:52,560
- Will you stop? I'm on the telephone.
- Can I talk to her, please?

174
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,601
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

176
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,521
What's the rope for?

177
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,241
Well, how do you like that?
I got rope.

178
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:18,435
Well, I gotta go.

179
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,355
- The dog. You're getting the dog!
- Kramer, where you going?

180
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,963
- Out!
- Don't go. Kramer! Come back.

181
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,482
I got great news!

182
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:30,800
Well...

183
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,078
...I did it.

184
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,399
- Did what?
- I got engaged. I'm getting married.

185
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,400
I asked Susan to marry me.
We're getting married this Christmas.

186
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,684
- You're getting married?
- Yes!

187
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,647
- Oh, my God!
- I asked her to get married.

188
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,719
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man.

189
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:52,717
And do you know why?

190
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:54,957
It's because of that talk we had.

191
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,244
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.

192
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,716
That lunch was the defining moment
of my life.

193
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,036
- I'm blown away!
- Are you blown?

194
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,084
- Blown!
- You like that?

195
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,681
- And she said yes?
- Well...

196
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:11,919
...it took a couple hours of convincing,
but I was persistent.

197
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:14,555
I was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.

198
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,366
She said yes.
I can't believe my luck...

199
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:21,202
...that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.

200
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,278
You think she's good-looking, right?

201
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,325
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.

202
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,682
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.

203
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,042
- A pinkish hue?
- Oh, she's got the hue.

204
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,120
So, what's going on with Melanie?
I know you're not getting married...

205
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,596
...but things are happening?
- Well...

206
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:42,601
...actually, we kind of broke up.

207
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,082
You what?

208
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,120
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.

209
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:50,165
She eats her peas one at a time.

210
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:53,479
You've never seen anything like it.
It takes her an hour to finish them.

211
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,160
We've had dinner other times.

212
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:58,922
I've seen her eat corn niblets,
but she scooped them.

213
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,925
- She scooped the niblets?
- Yes.

214
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,601
That's what was so vexing.

215
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,078
- What about the pact?
- What?

216
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:15,726
What happened to the pact?

217
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,923
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.

218
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,918
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?

219
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:23,397
You stuck your hand out,
so I shook it.

220
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,841
I don't know about a pact.

221
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:27,316
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.

222
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:28,886
You're getting married.

223
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,436
Well, it's not that. I just... You know,
I thought that we were both...

224
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,563
You thought
I was gonna get married?

225
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,763
Well, maybe not married, but...

226
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,724
I mean, you love Susan, right?

227
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

228
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,556
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.

229
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,040
Yeah.

230
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,405
So?

231
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,925
Yeah.

232
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,927
- This doesn't make any difference.
- No.

233
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:02,119
- So we're still on to see Firestorm?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:04,676
I'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.

235
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,686
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

236
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:11,485
Celebrate!
How about some champagne?

237
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,205
- Champagne?
- Yes, come on!

238
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,244
How often do you get engaged?

239
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,477
- Come on.
- Okay. All right.

240
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,204
You know what?

241
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,319
No champagne.

242
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:39,443
Anyway, I'll see you later.

243
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:41,796
Yeah.

244
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,043
That's it. That's it.
Stop right here.

245
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,767
How much is that doggie
In the window?

246
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,565
Will you shut up?

247
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,524
Is that a new song?

248
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,200
All right, give me the rope.

249
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,119
What? What do you need
a rope for?

250
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,801
- Look, I don't have time to explain.
- Oh, I don't know.

251
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,639
I'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.

252
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,162
- I knew you'd back out.
- Are we doing a bad thing?

253
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:12,036
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.

254
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:13,845
They find it and adopt it.

255
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:17,966
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.

256
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,083
Fresh air, dandelions.

257
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,397
We're doing this dog a huge favour.

258
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,236
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,927
- That's him.
- All right.

260
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,076
I'm going in.

261
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,718
Keep the motor running.

262
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,836
Ready?

263
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
- I don't really think I can go.
- Oh, how come?

264
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,603
Well, I didn't really tell Susan
about it...

265
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,679
...and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.

266
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,075
She can come.

267
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,645
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see Firestorm.

268
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,081
She...

269
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,480
She wants to see The Muted Heart.

270
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,279
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glenn Close,
Sally Field. That should be good.

271
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:08,280
- Yeah. I guess I'll see you later.
- Wait. We can share a cab.

272
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,245
- They're playing at the same Cineplex.
- George, better get ready.

273
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,400
I am ready.

274
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,081
You're wearing that shirt?

275
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,555
- Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,566
- What time you got?
- No, I don't wear a watch.

277
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,880
- Well, what do you do?
- Well, I tell time by the sun.

278
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,119
- How close do you get?
- Well, I can guess within an hour.

279
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:39,242
Well, I can guess within the hour, and
I don't even have to look at the sun.

280
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,805
What about at night?
What do you then?

281
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,039
Well, night's tougher.
But it's only a couple of hours.

282
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,846
- Okay, let's go. Move.
- You got it?

283
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,043
What do you think?
Drive! Drive!

284
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,726
Where is it? Where is it?

285
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:57,760
This?

286
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,395
- This is the dog?
- Yep.

287
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,240
- But it's so small.
- Yeah, but he's a fighter.

288
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:05,967
That can't be the dog.
You sure you got the right one?

289
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,402
You said the second courtyard.
He was there.

290
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,444
- How could that be it?
- Get him to bark.

291
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,996
- Yeah, I'll know it if it barks.
- All right. Bark.

292
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,316
- Bark!
- Bark!

293
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:15,840
- Bark!
- Bark!

294
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,201
- Bark!
- Bark!

295
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,924
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was very, very good.

296
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,796
- Do you think he'll ever find her?
- Oh, I sure hope so.

297
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,037
How about when Ford
jumped out of that plane...

298
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,959
...and was shooting back
as he was falling?

299
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:34,324
- What about the underwater escape?
- Oh, man.

300
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:42,120
Let's put the radio on.
Maybe there's a news report about it.

301
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:43,766
Let's dump it. I'm getting antsy.

302
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:46,282
- Think we're far enough?
- We're nearly to Monticello.

303
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,803
Yeah. I think this looks right.

304
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,884
All right. Give me the dog.

305
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,359
- Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
- There.

306
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,796
Okay, boy. This is it.

307
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,117
This is your new home.

308
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,120
Let go. Let go of my shirt.

309
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:08,518
Come on. Let go of my shirt!
This shirt is from Rudy's!

310
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:22,404
- Hello.
- MSG's rerunning the Yankee game.

311
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,761
- You watching?
- They are?

312
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:27,966
George, are you coming to bed?
I taped Mad About You.

313
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,839
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

314
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,201
What was that?

315
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,756
- Nothing. I gotta go.
- Oh, Mattingly just singled.

316
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:38,647
You know, it was very wrong of you
to back out on that deal.

317
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:42,083
- I just shook your hand.
- That's a deal where I come from.

318
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,919
We come from the same place.

319
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:46,123
George, I'm starting it.

320
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,323
I gotta go.

321
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:39,121
Roxy, where have you been?

322
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,723
We've been worried sick about you.

323
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,239
What's this?

324
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,963
No. No, it's impossible.

325
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,642
It's impossible.

326
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,318
I don't know how it happened.
We were practically in Monticello.

327
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:05,797
I mean, how could that thing have
found its way back? There is no way.

328
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,646
- Very strange.
- I know.

329
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,480
So tell me, anyway,
who was the big mastermind?

330
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,242
I can't, Jerry. I'm sworn to secrecy.

331
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:20,523
All right. But then I can't tell you
the big news.

332
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,918
News? What news?

333
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,759
Sorry.

334
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,885
What? What?

335
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,678
All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.

336
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:34,156
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.

337
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,318
It's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

338
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:40,526
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

339
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,880
George Costanza...

340
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,480
Yeah?

341
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,160
...is getting married!

342
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,878
Get out!

343
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,601
Hi.

344
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,962
- You Cosmo Kramer?
- Yes. Yeah.

345
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,366
- You recognize this piece of fabric?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...

346
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:05,880
What?

347
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,676
Nothing.

348
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,519
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

349
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,281
I have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...

350
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:15,439
...including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.

351
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,963
It seems as if the springs
were so compressed...

352
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,164
...that they collapsed the right side.
- Newman!

353
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,116
What took you so long?

354
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,399
- What do you think they'll do to us?
- Don't worry about a thing.

355
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,479
In 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.

356
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:44,162
We'll be back on the street
by lunch.

357
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,639
I gotta make some changes.

358
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,038
I'm not a woman. I'm a child.

359
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:52,723
What kind of life is this?
