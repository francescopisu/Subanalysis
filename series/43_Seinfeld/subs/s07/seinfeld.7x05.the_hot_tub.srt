1
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:07,242
I feel bad for the silver-medal winner
in the Olympics.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,284
I mean, how do you live with that?

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,803
"How much did you lose by?"
I don't even know.

4
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:17,165
It was like from now to now.
Now to now. Now, now, now."

5
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:19,884
It was... and that was it, I lost.

6
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:21,958
I trained, I worked out, I exercised.

7
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,446
I was doing pushups, sit-ups.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,598
I never did anything but exercise
for 20 years.

9
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,678
I flew halfway around the world...

10
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:33,677
And that was that.
It was a photo finish.

11
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:35,924
Silver, gold.

12
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,486
"If I had a pimple, I would have won."

13
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,997
Can't believe you write
for the J. Peterman catalogue.

14
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,762
Get this one,
"I packed my rod and reel.

15
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,361
Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord...

16
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,006
...a welcoming smile.

17
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:58,479
Thank God she spotted the epaulets
on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest."

18
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:02,007
This catalogue is all about
how to score in a foreign country.

19
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:04,397
- Yeah, what do you do all day?
- Not that much.

20
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,281
I thought that new promotion
was supposed to be more work?

21
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,596
When the season starts.

22
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,644
Right now, I sit around
pretending I'm busy.

23
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:14,038
- How do you pull that off?
- I always look annoyed.

24
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:18,921
When you look annoyed all the time,
people think that you're busy.

25
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,039
Think about it.

26
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:25,996
Yeah, you do.

27
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,600
- He looks busy.
- He looks very busy.

28
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,120
I know what I'm doing.

29
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:32,006
In fact, Mr. Wilhelm gave me
one of those little stress dolls.

30
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,284
All right. Back to work.

31
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,319
So did you come up
with a stupid story...

32
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:42,239
...for the Himalayan
walking shoe yet?

33
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:44,557
No, I'm completely blocked.

34
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,241
In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight.

35
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,886
Oh, no.

36
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:53,040
I can't. I got that marathon runner
coming in tonight.

37
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,435
What marathon runner?

38
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,404
You know, this guy, Jean-Paul?

39
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,444
I met him when I was
working at Pendant...

40
00:01:58,607 --> 00:01:59,926
...editing a book on running.

41
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,807
- Oh, wait Jean-Paul Jean-Paul.
- Yes.

42
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,037
He overslept at the Olympics
four years ago...

43
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,402
...missed the marathon.

44
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,321
Yeah, that's him.

45
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,443
He's from Trinidad and Tobago,
right?

46
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,724
Yeah, he's
Trinidadian and Tobagan.

47
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,598
How do you oversleep
at the Olympics?

48
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,399
I know. I know.

49
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,319
It's like the biggest event
of your life.

50
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,284
You'd think you'd have
six alarm clocks...

51
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,915
...paying off little kids
to come banging on your door.

52
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,566
Well, he was pretty devastated.

53
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,957
This is his first race in three years.

54
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,358
That's a big responsibility
on your hands.

55
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,917
What responsibility?
I don't have any responsibility.

56
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,442
Well, you gotta wake him up.

57
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,439
He'll get up.

58
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,439
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Elaine, how are you?

59
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:44,881
Fine.

60
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,639
- I've seen her in your building.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,957
- I didn't know she was married.
- She's not.

62
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,318
And the guy just took off.

63
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,962
- Don't say anything.
- Who am I gonna tell?

64
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,561
I know, it's just something
you have to say.

65
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,397
George, we just got
the final budget numbers.

66
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
We went over budget
on some of the items...

67
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,001
...but I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.

68
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,759
I'll let you get back to work,
George.

69
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,485
He overslept
and missed the whole race.

70
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:32,763
- Isn't that amazing?
- I'll tell you what happened.

71
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,441
I bet he got
the a.m. -p.m. Mixed up.

72
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,480
My money's on the snooze.

73
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,798
I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five,
and it never came back on.

74
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,723
Imagine, your whole life riding
on an alarm clock.

75
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,845
Alarm clocks? No, I never use them.
Don't trust them.

76
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,646
- What do you do?
- I have a mental alarm.

77
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,196
I set my head
for quarter to 7...

78
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,756
...and... I get up.

79
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,679
- It always works?
- It never fails.

80
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,439
See, it's based on your body clock.

81
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,963
Your body has an internal mechanism.
It knows what time it is.

82
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,880
- What's with the bucket?
- Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

83
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,799
- Hot tub?
- Yeah, it's in my living room.

84
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,956
I just gotta fill it.

85
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,086
You put a hot tub
in your living room?

86
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,045
It's a beauty. It's got these
high-volume accusage jets...

87
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:22,758
...oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle.

88
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:26,124
That water's gonna get
over 120 degrees.

89
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,357
- Is that tolerable?
- Oh, it's tolerable.

90
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:34,558
Isn't that the same temperature
of the coffee that scalded you?

91
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,479
I think it's a little cooler than that.

92
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,719
He doesn't have any running water?

93
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,798
I don't ask those kind
of questions anymore.

94
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,276
Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.

95
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,802
- Hi, Jean-Paul, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

96
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,403
- Sorry about the Olympics.
- Me too.

97
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:57,244
Listen, I'm gonna go call work,
see if I can get my deadline extended.

98
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:59,637
I can't come up
with anything for this thing.

99
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,160
Catalogue-writer's block?

100
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,803
Yeah, that's funny.

101
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:11,359
So, what happened?

102
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,364
The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

103
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,119
No, man, it wasn't the snooze.

104
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:19,643
Most people think it was the snooze,
but no, no snooze.

105
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:23,800
- A.m. -p. M?
- Man, it wasn't the a.m. -p.m.

106
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,320
It was the volume.

107
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,758
- Oh, the volume.
- Yes, the volume.

108
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,441
There was a separate knob
for the radio alarm.

109
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:35,965
- Oh, separate knob.
- Yeah, separate knob.

110
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,961
Why separate knob!
Why separate knob!

111
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:43,324
Some people like to have the alarm
a little louder than the radio.

112
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,285
Oh, please, man, please!

113
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:50,076
It's not gonna happen again.
Not if I have anything to say about it.

114
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,841
Elaine, what's the alarm clock
situation at your house?

115
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,963
- Jerry...
- It's a simple question.

116
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,880
I've got an alarm, okay?

117
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,244
That old one? Didn't I miss a flight
to Cleveland because of that clock?

118
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,159
- Flight to Cleveland?
- It works.

119
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:06,399
- Elaine.
- It works.

120
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,081
"Singing duo, Captain and..."?

121
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,318
Tennille!

122
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,598
Come on.

123
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,766
George...

124
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,157
...I think you may be
taking work too seriously.

125
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,682
Well, I've got a lot to do.

126
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,803
George, I'll tell you
what I'd like you to do.

127
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,482
I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this fun little assignment.

128
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:41,717
There are some reps in
from the Houston Astros...

129
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,559
...for talks on
that Interleague Play...

130
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:45,877
...and I want you
to show them a good time.

131
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,675
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

132
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,360
You're 40 minutes late.

133
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:57,246
- What happened?
- I got held up.

134
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:00,126
- Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
- No.

135
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,517
What? What is the problem?

136
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,723
You said you were gonna be here
a certain time...

137
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:06,639
...and you weren't.

138
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,559
And this all means what?

139
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,797
It means that a man
has come from very far away...

140
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:13,719
...to compete in
a very difficult race...

141
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:16,196
...put his faith in you,
and I'm a little concerned.

142
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,164
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

143
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:21,000
Hey, I'm not running
in the marathon, he is.

144
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,236
- Yeah, I know that.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,921
I've got enough to think about
trying to come up with...

146
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,998
...some crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe.

147
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,397
I've given him a place to stay,
I'll set an alarm...

148
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,035
...but I'm not gonna turn my life
completely upside down.

149
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:36,120
I'm not talking about upside down,
I'm talking about waking him up.

150
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,239
Hey, Jean-Paul.

151
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,919
Jean-Paul, how was your soak?
A good soak?

152
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:44,921
Oh, man, very good soak.
The soak of the year.

153
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,484
What's burning?

154
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,199
My muffin.

155
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,441
Shoot.

156
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,165
- What happened?
- I don't know.

157
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,806
I set this thing for 20 seconds.

158
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,686
This was for two minutes, see?

159
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,121
Don't say anything.

160
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,198
Don't say anything.

161
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,437
You mis-set the timer?

162
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,439
Jean-Paul, it's not
my microwave, okay? Okay?

163
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,837
All right, listen, let's just go.
Come on, Jean-Paul.

164
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,804
- Let's go.
- Okay.

165
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,037
- We'll see you at the race, okay?
- Yeah, I hope so.

166
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,765
Oh, that's cute.

167
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,646
Kramer, I'm telling you,
Elaine doesn't know what she's doing.

168
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,321
I gotta take over
this whole operation.

169
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,524
Jerry, look how tense you are.

170
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,757
You need to take a soak.

171
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,316
I'm not taking a soak...

172
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,638
...in that human bacteria frappe
you got going there.

173
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm telling you, it's great.
I opened up all the windows.

174
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,719
The air is cold,
the tub is boiling hot.

175
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,605
It's like Sweden, man.

176
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,281
Sweden.

177
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,597
Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,560
Till this bastard over here says:

179
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,321
"Let's call the sons of bitches,
go visit them in New York."

180
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,283
Well, we're certainly glad
that you could make it.

181
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,403
I like your organization, George.

182
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,003
We've been talking to a friendly
son of bitch in the front office.

183
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,523
- Wilhelm, I think his name is.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. Wilhelm.

184
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:29,078
He told us George Costanza's gonna
be taking us bastards out on the town.

185
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:33,160
We said, "That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's got in store for him."

186
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,477
- Finish your drink?
- Oh, yeah, almost. Almost.

187
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,684
Let's get that bastard
to bring us another round, huh?

188
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,160
You a big drinker, George?

189
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,922
Well, maybe not
as much as this bastard.

190
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:46,606
I can hold my own.

191
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,923
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here
because I am concerned.

192
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:20,126
Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps
the biggest race of your entire career...

193
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,121
...and the person with whom
you have chosen to stay is...

194
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:28,075
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, get the hell out of there!

195
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,596
Let me put you in a hotel.
You'll be comfortable.

196
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:33,998
You'll be near the starting line,
and most importantly...

197
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,601
...you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul.

198
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,486
- A wake-up call.
- Wake-up call?

199
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,716
These people never fail.

200
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,845
They sit in a room
with a big clock all night long...

201
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,202
...just waiting to make that call.

202
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,720
No, I will stay with Elaine,
it would be rude.

203
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:51,798
Hey, you bastards.

204
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,196
Hey, so how was the meeting?

205
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,597
I really like those sons of bitches.

206
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,678
- Sons of bitches?
- Yeah. That's how they talk.

207
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:02,122
You know, everyone's a bastard
or a son of a bitch.

208
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,404
Yeah, it's like, " Boy, that son of a bitch
Boggs can really hit."

209
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,682
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,122
That's how they talk
in the major league.

211
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,685
Oh, boy.

212
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:12,916
Hey.

213
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,120
- How many sweaters you got on?
- Four.

214
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,324
Could I have a cup of tea,
boiling hot?

215
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,279
What's going on?

216
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,598
I fell asleep in the hot tub,
and the heat pump broke.

217
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,406
Water went down to 58 degrees.

218
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,365
I can't get
my core temperature back up.

219
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:33,962
Your core temperature?

220
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,887
Here, feel my hand.
Yeah, feel.

221
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,800
This son of a bitch is ice cold.

222
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,276
- Hello?
- Is that you, George?

223
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,005
Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

224
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,557
Well, listen, you son of a bitch,
you know where we are?

225
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,799
Thirty thousand feet
above your head, you bastard.

226
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,998
What are they doing
letting you on an airplane?

227
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,123
Don't they know
that's against FAA regulation?

228
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:58,845
Hush up now. I can't hear.

229
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,044
Listen, I want you to send those
agreements the minute you land.

230
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,084
Our boys can't wait
to kick your butts.

231
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:05,839
When's that bastard
coming to Houston?

232
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,760
Zeke wants to know when you
bastards are coming to Houston?

233
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:12,715
Hey, you tell that son of a bitch
no Yankee is ever coming to Houston.

234
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,037
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

235
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,482
Speak up, George, I can't hear you.

236
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,763
You tell that son of a bitch...

237
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,441
...no Yankee
is ever coming to Houston.

238
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,041
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

239
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,482
- George! Get ahold of yourself.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

240
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,717
What's the matter with you?

241
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:37,718
It was a cold winter's night
in Timbuktu.

242
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,877
This stinks.

243
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,522
Come on. Come on.

244
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,996
- I'm a friend of Elaine's.
- Oh, hi.

246
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,524
Oh, look at that cute little bastard.

247
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:03,475
You are mommy's little bastard,
aren't you?

248
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,004
What are you doing
harassing my tenants?

249
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,842
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch,
I'm just trying to be friendly.

250
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,640
All right, that's it. Let's go.

251
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,240
Man, I got a race tomorrow.

252
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,360
- It's like a furnace in here.
- What the hell is going on?

253
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,516
I turned up the heat.

254
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:24,359
Turn up the heat
in your own apartment.

255
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,040
I'm freezing.

256
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:27,799
I just need
to get my hot tub running.

257
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,204
I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

258
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,403
Well, what's in this giant box
out in the hall?

259
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,238
- Oh, that must be it.
- It's huge.

260
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,922
Yeah, I got the biggest one they had.
Yeah, it's industrial strength.

261
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,885
Sixteen thousand Btu's.

262
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:46,966
Hello.

263
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,641
Yeah, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

264
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:52,276
You can count on me.

265
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,280
- What?
- I got the call.

266
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,438
- Jean-Paul?
- Jean-Paul.

267
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,518
Very lucky to find this hotel,
Jean-Paul.

268
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:04,359
Man, I just want to get some sleep.

269
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,965
All right.
Let's check out the clock.

270
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,765
Notch good.

271
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,963
6:50.

272
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,403
Volume check.

273
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,079
What kind of music
you wanna wake up to?

274
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:23,397
- Top 40, Classical?
- Man, whatever.

275
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,206
- How about adult contemporary?
- Fine, adult contemporary.

276
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,722
- Just pick one.
- All right.

277
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:32,436
We're going with adult contempo.

278
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,919
Now the fail-safe.

279
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,841
The wake-up guy.

280
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,157
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.

281
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,204
- Front desk.
- Yes, this is room 419.

282
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,439
I'd like a wake-up call
for 6:50 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

283
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,835
Yes, sir.

284
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:51,317
That's room 419, 6:50 a.m.

285
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:53,955
Four-one-niner.

286
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,365
Yes, I got it, sir.
You only had to say it once.

287
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,803
But it's a very important wake-up call,
and I don't wanna take any chances.

288
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,685
Every wak e-up call I mak e
is important.

289
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,883
You're no more important
than any of our guests.

290
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,515
Well, I don't want to get into
a thing with you here, but...

291
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,362
- Are you through?
- Yeah, I am, but I just...

292
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,083
What is it?

293
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,637
I think I offended the wake-up guy.

294
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,243
- No, no.
- No, no, I did.

295
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,126
- I think he's got it in for me.
- He doesn't have it in for you.

296
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:29,676
- What if he doesn't call out of spite?
- It is his job.

297
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,165
I'm not comfortable.

298
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,563
For God's sake.

299
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,404
Jean-Paul?

300
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,163
Hey, Jean-Paul?

301
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,799
Jean-Paul?

302
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,165
Jean-Paul?

303
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,283
Oh, man.

304
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,804
- Oh, machine.
- I'm not here. Leave a message.

305
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:08,324
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul is missing.
He's alone in the city. Call me back.

306
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,404
- Judy, hi, listen...
- You have got some nerve, Elaine.

307
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,035
I told you about that baby
in confidence.

308
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,041
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.

309
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,403
Well, your friend certainly seemed
to know all about it.

310
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,999
Jerry!

311
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,677
I feel much better here
at my home base, Jean-Paul.

312
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,246
It's a controlled environment.

313
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,284
It's a marathon, you know?
Twenty-six miles.

314
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:40,596
I need to get some sleep.

315
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:43,645
Hey, believe me, if I had been
with you there in Barcelona...

316
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,844
...you'd be polishing that medal
right now.

317
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,955
I left a comfortable hotel bed for this.

318
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,277
That wake-up guy was trouble.

319
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,718
All right, I'll be right back.

320
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,555
Man, that thing is noisy.

321
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:09,561
We're cranking along pretty good.
We're almost up to 80 degrees.

322
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:13,083
Listen, do me a favour, set your mental
alarm for 6:30 and give me a call.

323
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,805
Okay.

324
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:18,601
Done.

325
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,676
He's put his faith in you.
He's put his faith in you.

326
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:25,883
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

327
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,958
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

328
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,364
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

329
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,204
I'm exhausted.

330
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,040
I've been on this street
1000 times.

331
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,437
It's never look ed so strange.

332
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,882
The faces, so cold.

333
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,675
In the distance, a child is crying.

334
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,166
Fatherless.

335
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,716
A bastard child, perhaps.

336
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,123
My back aches.

337
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,847
My heart aches, but my feet...

338
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,997
My feet are resilient.

339
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:04,406
Thank God I took off my heels
and put on my...

340
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,842
...Himalayan walking shoes!

341
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,558
4:02?

342
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,207
8:47? Jean-Paul!
Wake up, wake up!

343
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:54,037
Jean-Paul, the electricity went out!
Wake up, wake up, we've gotta go!

344
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,437
- It's 8:47!
- 8:47?

345
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,964
Come on. Just put your clothes on.
You'll get dressed in the car.

346
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:02,838
Idiot, I trusted you!

347
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,317
Kramer, what happened?
The electricity went out.

348
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,876
Yeah, the heat pump
blew all the fuses.

349
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,044
What happened to your mental alarm?

350
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:12,279
Well, I guess I hit the snooze.

351
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,238
Make way. Watch out.
I've got a runner here.

352
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,556
Get out of the way.

353
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,283
Make way, make way.
Make way, he's a contender.

354
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,359
- Hey, hold it.
- I'm late, man. I'm in the race.

355
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:41,926
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Jerry.

356
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:44,123
You're a wonderful driver.
Fantastic route, man.

357
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:46,278
All right, go.
It's a race. Come on.

358
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,565
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, George, come in, come in.

359
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:54,082
Word has it you've been
cracking under the pressure.

360
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,238
Can't cope, can't stand the heat.
Spit the bit.

361
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,046
Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain...

362
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,402
We all get a little cuckoo.
I used to be like you.

363
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,400
Berating personnel, calling managers
on the field during a game.

364
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,127
Threatening to move the team
to New Jersey to upset people.

365
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,481
Then I found a way to relax.

366
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,399
I've got two words
to say to you, George.

367
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,125
Hot tub.

368
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:15,077
I'm telling you, I never told
anyone about that baby.

369
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,760
I never even went near your building.

370
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,885
- Then how did she find out, Jerry?
- You should check with the rabbi.

371
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:23,280
- You want some hot tea?
- Oh, no, thank you.

372
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,324
Oh, there's some runners.
Here they come.

373
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,278
There's Jean-Paul.
He's out front.

374
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,521
- He's leading! Go, Jean-Paul!
- Yeah!

375
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,802
Come on!

376
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,004
- One mile to go, Jean-Paul.
- Go, Jean-Paul!

377
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:12,243
How are you enjoying it, George?
Melts that tension away, doesn't it?

378
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,001
You gotta get that jet
on the good spot.

379
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,476
Yes, that feels good.
Yes, that's real good.

380
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,365
Yeah, that's where I keep
all my tension.

381
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,801
Right under that chicken bone.

382
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:23,800
I get my wife to stick her thumb
right in there like a screwdriver.

383
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,525
The Phillips head, not the flat one.

384
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,598
Oh, God, those flat ones
frustrate me.

385
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,884
You got it in, but it slips out.
Put it in again, it slips out again.

386
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:33,561
- You a single man, George?
- Well, I just recently...

387
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,957
You wanna get something wild
going on in your life...

388
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,799
...get a girl and
bring her in one of these.

389
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,605
It's like four shots of Wild Turkey.

390
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,485
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.

391
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,558
Terrible about that Mickey Mantle,
wasn't it?

392
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,605
You know, we used to talk.
I don't think he liked me very much.
