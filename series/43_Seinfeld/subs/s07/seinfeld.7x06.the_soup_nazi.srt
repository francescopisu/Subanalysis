1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,321
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.

2
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:08,997
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested...

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:11,522
...so you feel like half the work
is done already.

4
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,155
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out
with an IV line of soup...

5
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,841
...that you could just jam
right into your arm, you know?

6
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,282
Campbell's tomato intravenous.

7
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:21,199
Mainline gumbo.

8
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,927
Everyone just sitting around
at dinner with their soup IV...

9
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:26,317
...hanging on the hook there,
you know?

10
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,523
How's yours, Grandpa?

11
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:32,882
Oh, chunky style.

12
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,884
What theatre do you wanna
go to tonight?

13
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:43,517
We got 61 st and 3rd
or 84th and Broadway.

14
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,479
Which one you wanna go to,
Schmoopie?

15
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,444
You called me "Schmoopie."
You're Schmoopie.

16
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:49,120
- You're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.

17
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:51,517
You're Schmoopie.

18
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:54,679
All right, Schmoopies,
what's it gonna be?

19
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,963
- Pick a theatre.
- We'll go to 3rd Avenue.

20
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,039
So can you come with us
to the soup place?

21
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:02,279
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.

22
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:03,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

23
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,365
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Sheila.

24
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:07,916
All right, then I'll see you later.

25
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,998
- Bye, Schmoopie.
- Bye, Schmoopie.

26
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,960
Okay, we ready to go?

27
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:17,277
Yes, please. Please, let's go.

28
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:19,039
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.

29
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,437
- No, we gotta go to the soup place.
- What soup place?

30
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:23,677
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.

31
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:24,836
He's always raving.

32
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,316
I finally got a chance to go,
and I tell you this:

33
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,806
You will be stunned.

34
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,241
Stunned by soup?

35
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,444
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.

36
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:35,086
All right, let's go. Come on.

37
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,839
There's only one caveat.

38
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,316
Guy who runs the place
is a little temperamental.

39
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,796
Especially about
the ordering procedure.

40
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,039
He's secretly referred to
as the "Soup Nazi."

41
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,085
What happens
if you don't order right?

42
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,807
- He yells, and you don't get your soup.
- What?

43
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,162
Just follow the procedure
and you will be fine.

44
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:54,363
- All right, let's go over that again.
- All right.

45
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:58,759
As you walk in the place,
move immediately to your right.

46
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,202
Okay, the main thing
is to keep the line moving.

47
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,927
You hold out your money,
speak your soup in a clear voice...

48
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,043
...step to the left, and receive soup.
- Right.

49
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,243
It's very important not
to embellish your order.

50
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:11,558
No extraneous comments,
no questions, no compliments.

51
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,321
- Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
- Elaine.

52
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:16,682
Jerry, that's enough now
about the Soup Nazi.

53
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,161
Look at this.

54
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:23,558
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.

55
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,242
It's French, armoire.

56
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,045
Armoire.

57
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:30,959
- How much is this?
- I was asking 250.

58
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,277
But you got a nice face.
Two even.

59
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,564
Two hundred. You know, I've always
wanted one of these things.

60
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:42,356
- He gave you the nice-face discount.
- Yeah. All right, you guys go ahead.

61
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:45,599
- What about the soup?
- I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.

62
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,439
Pardon.

63
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:49,881
This line is huge.

64
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,526
And it's like this all the time.

65
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,121
Isn't that that Bania guy?

66
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:57,684
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.

67
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,236
Too late. I think
he picked up the scent.

68
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,481
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know
you liked soup.

69
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:05,120
Hard to believe.

70
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,755
This guy makes the best soup
in the city, Jerry. The best.

71
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,838
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."

72
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,042
All right, Bania.

73
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,801
- I'm not letting you cut in line.
- Why not?

74
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,923
If he catches us,
we'll never get soup again.

75
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,520
Okay, okay.

76
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,562
Medium turkey chili.

77
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,998
Medium crab bisque.

78
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,204
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it. Let it go.

79
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,916
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.

80
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:49,440
Bread, $2.00 extra.

81
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,075
Two dollars? But everyone
in front of me got free bread.

82
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,999
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.

83
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,759
Three dollars!

84
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,846
- What?
- No soup for you!

85
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:10,557
What do you mean,
I can't bring it in? I live here.

86
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,558
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.

87
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,116
- That's the rule.
- But I didn't know, Tom.

88
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,438
Can't you just make an exception?
Please? I've got a nice face.

89
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,885
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.

90
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,241
I'll even give you a hand.

91
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,127
- You're gonna have to hold it.
- I'm the guy on the sidewalk.

92
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:27,561
I don't have layaway.

93
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,002
Oh, no. Please don't go.

94
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,840
Please. Please don't walk away.

95
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,925
Oh, man.

96
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,241
Oh, this is fantastic.

97
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,643
How does he do it?

98
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,245
I don't see how you can sit there
eating, and not even offer me any?

99
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,604
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?

100
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,446
- Why can't we share?
- I told you not to say anything.

101
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,963
You can't go in there, flout the rules,
and then think I'm gonna share.

102
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:02,244
- Do you hear you yourself?
- I'm sorry.

103
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,604
This is what comes
from living under a Nazi regime.

104
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,562
Well, I gotta go back there
and try again.

105
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:10,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

106
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,241
- Hi, Schmoopie.
- Hi, Schmoopie.

107
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:14,762
- No, you're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.

108
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,883
- Going.
- Hey, listen...

109
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,277
...so we'll meet you and Susan
at the movie tonight?

110
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,237
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't think so.

111
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,796
- Why?
- I just don't feel like it anymore.

112
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,403
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

113
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:31,918
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?

114
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,642
Yeah.

116
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:41,446
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

117
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,962
Elaine has to leave her armoire
on the street all night.

118
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,526
I'm gonna guard it for her.

119
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,439
I need something to sit on.

120
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,518
Well, sit on one of your cushions.

121
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,360
But this is so nice and thick.

122
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:57,995
Ahoy, there.

123
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,123
Oh, Kramer, thank God.

124
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,438
- I really appreciate your doing this.
- Well, you asked for it, you got it.

125
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:05,165
Do you need anything?

126
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,761
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani
would hit the spot.

127
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,804
- Mulagatani?
- Yeah, it's an Indian soup.

128
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,436
Simmered to perfection...

129
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:14,121
...by one of the great
soup artisans in the modern era.

130
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:16,726
Who, the Soup Nazi?

131
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,036
He's not a Nazi.

132
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,562
He just happens to be
a little eccentric.

133
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,160
You know, most geniuses are.

134
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,640
- I'll be back.
- Wait a second.

135
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,798
- You don't know how to order.
- No, I got it.

136
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,527
- No, Elaine.
- Hey, I got it.

137
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,759
Hey, didn't you already get soup?

138
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,804
No, I didn't get it.

139
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,044
Why? What happened?

140
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,118
I made a mistake.

141
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,240
Well, we'll see
what happens to you.

142
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,398
Yeah, no, listen, George,
I am quite certain...

143
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,081
...l'm walking out of there
with a bowl of soup.

144
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,999
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me...

145
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,920
...or do you find it unbearable
to be around Jerry and that girl?

146
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,839
Oh, I know.

147
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,156
It's awful.

148
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,965
Why do they do that
in front of people?

149
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:03,163
- I don't know.
- What is that with the Schmoopie?

150
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,238
- Schmoopie.
- Oh, stop it. I know.

151
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,524
I had to listen to a discussion on
which one is actually called Schmoopie.

152
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,757
I cancelled plans
to go to the movies with them.

153
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,600
- You know, we should say something.
- We absolutely should.

154
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,679
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?

155
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,360
- He can be so weird sometimes.
- Yes.

156
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,199
- I haven't figured him out.
- Me neither.

157
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,604
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.

158
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,564
Oh, God.

159
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,318
Good afternoon.

160
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,605
One large crab bisque to go.

161
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,077
Bread. Beautiful.

162
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,841
You're pushing your luck, little man.

163
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,485
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,166
Hey, there.

165
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:03,043
Oh, one mulagatani, and...

166
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,119
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?

167
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,439
- Yes.
- Never been a big fan.

168
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:12,322
You know what?

169
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,047
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like Al Pacino?

170
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,363
You know, Scent of a Woman.

171
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,845
Very good. Very good.

172
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,123
You know something?
No soup for you!

173
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,836
- What?
- Come back, one year!

174
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:29,802
Next!

175
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,121
- Look at this.
- It's an antique.

176
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,881
It's all handmade,
and I love the inlay.

177
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,560
Yes, yes. Me too.

178
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,002
It's gorgeous, completely. Pick it up.

179
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,716
- Pick it up from the bottom.
- Wait, what are you doing?

180
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,276
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.

181
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:49,956
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.

182
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,719
Look, you wanna get hurt?

183
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:55,278
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.

184
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,641
Now, just back off.

185
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,839
- Bob.
- Just pick it up.

186
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,520
Hey, what is this, huh?

187
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,565
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?

188
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,082
We're taking the armoire,
and that's all there is to it.

189
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,839
Okay?

190
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:18,686
I mean, is he allowed to do this?

191
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,166
It's discrimination.

192
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,238
I'm gonna call the state's
attorney's office.

193
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,841
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.

194
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:26,645
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.

195
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,320
- Oh, my God. I've gotta sit down.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,402
What happened?
Where's my armoire?

197
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:44,845
- It was stolen.
- What?

198
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,645
These street toughs,
they robbed me.

199
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,842
Street toughs took my armoire?

200
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,282
Yeah, it was very frightening.

201
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:53,766
My life was in danger.

202
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,838
You should've seen
the way they talked to me.

203
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,916
- I can't believe this!
- So where's the soup?

204
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:01,118
The Soup Nazi threw me out.

205
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,918
Yeah!

206
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,281
- What are you gonna get?
- I'll decide at the last minute.

207
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,239
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.

208
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,725
Sheila!

209
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,478
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?

210
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,126
Nobody kisses in my line.

211
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:23,556
- I can kiss anywhere I want to.
- You just cost yourself a soup.

212
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,356
How dare you?

213
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,916
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.

214
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,841
Jerry?

215
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,197
Do I know you?

216
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:49,681
So essentially,
you chose soup over a woman?

217
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,443
It was a bisque.

218
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,518
Yeah, you know what
I've just realized?

219
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:59,123
Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.

220
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,357
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, I mean, think about it.

221
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,279
He's engaged to be married.

222
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,677
Your top priority is soup.

223
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,360
Have you tasted the soup?

224
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,436
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.

225
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,080
See, it's much easier
to patch things up with Sheila...

226
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,760
...than with the Soup Nazi.

227
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,844
- Hey.
- Hey.

228
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,679
- Oh, thanks.
- There he is.

229
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,600
Elaine, I'm really sorry
about the armoire.

230
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,802
Yeah, I know. Me too.

231
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,765
- So did these thieves want any money?
- No.

232
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,805
- They just wanted the armoire?
- Yeah, they were quite taken with it.

233
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

234
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,167
Have you noticed
George is acting a little strange lately?

235
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:39,555
No. In what way?

236
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,719
I don't know. A lot of attitude,
like he's better than me.

237
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,685
I don't think George has ever thought
he's better than anybody.

238
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,005
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,355
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?

241
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:55,761
Absolutely not.

242
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,365
- Something's going on here.
- All right.

243
00:11:58,527 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm gonna go get some soup.

244
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,322
One of these days,
that guy is gonna get his.

245
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,079
So how was the movie?

246
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,886
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.

247
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,045
Oh, yeah?

248
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,281
Yeah.

249
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,845
What, are you happy?

250
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,035
- Happy? Why should I be happy?
- I don't know.

251
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,084
But you look like you're happy.

252
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,566
Why should I care?

253
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:22,995
You can't fool me.

254
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,362
Don't insult me,
because I know when you're happy.

255
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,722
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.

256
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:32,038
The two of you were making me
and every one of your friends sick.

257
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,198
Right, Elaine?

258
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:38,881
Is that so?

259
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:42,517
Yeah. With all that kissing and the
"Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."

260
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:45,121
- Out in public like that. It's disgusting.
- Disgusting?

261
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:47,517
People who do that
should be arrested.

262
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,156
I guess I have all the more reason
to get back with her.

263
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:53,046
And we had a pact, you know.

264
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,876
- What?
- You shook my hand.

265
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,480
You're still with the pact?

266
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,002
- You reneged.
- All I did was shake your hand.

267
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:09,005
And then they just ran off
with the armoire, just like that.

268
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,601
This city.

269
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,685
One large jambalaya, please.

270
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:24,922
- So continue.
- My friend is awfully disappointed.

271
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,998
You know, she's very emotional.

272
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,325
Thank you.

273
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,923
Jambalaya.

274
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,401
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.

275
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,000
I have an armoire in my basement.

276
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,362
If you want to pick it up,
you're welcome to it.

277
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:46,483
So take it, it's yours.

278
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,399
How can I possibly thank you?

279
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,319
You are the only one
who understands me.

280
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,047
- You suffer for your soup.
- Yes, that is right.

281
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,085
You demand perfection
from yourself, from your soup.

282
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,442
How can I tolerate any less
from my customers?

283
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,839
Gazpacho, por fav or.

284
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,398
- "Por fav or"?
- Oh, I'm part Spanish.

285
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,400
Adios, muchacho.

286
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,842
You heard him. Get out.

287
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,006
It was stupid of me.

288
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,441
Well, it was very insulting.

289
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,677
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.

290
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,846
Well, behind every joke
there's some truth.

291
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,123
Well, what about that
Bavarian cream pie joke?

292
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,515
There's no truth to that.

293
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,723
Nobody with a terminal illness
goes to Europe...

294
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,559
...for a piece of Bavarian cream pie...

295
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:32,163
...and then when they don't have it,
he says, "I'll just have some coffee."

296
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,076
- There's no truth to that.
- Well, I guess you're right.

297
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:40,042
- So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
- Yes, Schmoopie.

298
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,558
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Susan.

299
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,319
George. You remember Sheila.

300
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,796
- Oh, yes. Hello.
- Hello. Won't you join us?

301
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,003
- No, thanks. Yes.
- Of course.

302
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,882
So...

303
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,844
...you sit on the same side
in a booth?

304
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,043
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?

305
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:05,838
I just think it's a little unusual
for two people to sit on one side...

306
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,918
...and leave the other side empty.

307
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,998
Well, we're changing the rules.

308
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,759
Well, good for you.

309
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,122
What are you getting, George?

310
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,804
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?

311
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,004
I want you to get anything you want.

312
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,079
Because I love you so much,
and I want you to be happy.

313
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:27,680
Okay, sweetie?

314
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,678
Oh, George, you're so sweet.

315
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,680
Well, I can be a little
sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.

316
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,603
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?

317
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,157
- You want a little tuna fishy?
- Yeah, a little tuna fishy.

318
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,126
Fishy.

319
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,879
Come here.

320
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,319
And voilá!

321
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:59,285
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it!

322
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,880
I absolutely love it!

323
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,117
Yeah, did the K-Man do it
or did the K-Man do it?

324
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,039
- The K-man did it!
- Yeah!

325
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,516
- How much did you pay for this?
- How about zero?

326
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,247
What? What? Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?

327
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:11,675
I'll tell you where I got it.

328
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,566
From the guy you callously
refer to as the Soup Nazi.

329
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:16,683
Get out!

330
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:21,881
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?

331
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,596
Well, I told him the whole story,
and he just let me have it.

332
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,964
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.

333
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,641
Yeah, you know,
a little bit misunderstood, but...

334
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,843
I'm gonna go down there
and personally thank him.

335
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,441
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.

336
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,040
Yeah, well, he's a dear.

337
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:42,555
How much tip
do you leave on 8.15?

338
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,240
You know, sweetie...

339
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,080
...I just want you to know
that I was so proud of you today...

340
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,080
...expressing your feelings
so freely in front of Jerry and all.

341
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,556
Just knowing that you're
not afraid of those things...

342
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,321
...it's such a great step forward
in our relationship.

343
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:04,475
Because you love
your little Kiki, don't you?

344
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:13,040
- How is he today?
- I think he's in a good mood.

345
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,204
Hi.

346
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:20,724
Kramer gave me the armoire,
and it is so beautiful.

347
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:25,483
I mean, I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

348
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,606
You? If I knew it was for you,
I never would have given it to him!

349
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,884
I would have taken a hatchet
and smashed it to pieces.

350
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,719
Now, who wants soup?

351
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,997
Next, speak up.

352
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,043
I'm headed over to Elaine's.

353
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:48,763
Jerry, those are the guys
that mugged me for the armoire.

354
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,798
- Those two? Are you sure?
- That's them.

355
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,444
- Let's confront them.
- No, let's get a cop.

356
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,518
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.

357
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,676
Come on, let's go.

358
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,166
Wow, look,
that one is gorgeous.

359
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,680
I would just kill for that one.

360
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,644
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.

361
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:03,399
Do you know what
you're talking about?

362
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,718
I don't think you know what you're
talking about. Take a look at that.

363
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:07,956
Excuse me.

364
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:10,965
- Are you talking to me?
- Well...

365
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,516
I said, are you talking to me?

366
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,803
Well, maybe he was talking to me.

367
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,161
Was you talking to him?

368
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,283
Because you was
obviously talking to one of us.

369
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,166
So what is it? Who?
Who was you talking to?

370
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,675
We were kind of
talking to each other.

371
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,644
Weren't we?

372
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,479
I mean, you know, I've never been
so insulted in my entire life.

373
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,603
There's something really wrong
with this man.

374
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,644
He is a Soup Nazi.

375
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,923
- What? What is that?
- I don't know.

376
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,918
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushroom...

377
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,726
...half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery...

378
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,366
...chopped parsley..."
- Let me see.

379
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,403
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.

380
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,762
Look at this. There are like
30 different recipes.

381
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,679
These are his recipes.

382
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:03,439
- So?
- So?

383
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,764
His secret's out. Don't you see?

384
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,077
I could give these
to every restaurant in town.

385
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,521
I could have them published.

386
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,884
I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.

387
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,765
Wait, where do you think
you're going?

388
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:15,916
What do you care?

389
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,476
I don't want you causing trouble
down at that soup stand.

390
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:19,716
I love that soup.

391
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:23,283
- Get out of my way, Jerry.
- Elaine, let the man make his soup.

392
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,802
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.

393
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,919
Look, they have it in blue.

394
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:29,566
For my baby bluey.

395
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:33,276
- Are you my baby bluey?
- Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.

396
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,438
Oh, yes.

397
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,520
Well, well.

398
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,724
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey, Susan, George.

399
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,639
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.

400
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,277
Oh, really? Because we're kind of
not seeing each other anymore.

401
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,398
Oh, no, that's too bad.

402
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,127
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.

403
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,561
You know I love that.

404
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:56,596
But mentally we couldn't quite
make a connection.

405
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,001
- Really?
- Yeah.

406
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,159
Too bad. You gotta have the affection,
which you obviously have.

407
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,518
I think it's great that you're so open
with your affections in public.

408
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,325
See, we had that.

409
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,523
- You did?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,798
But the mental thing...

411
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,719
But, anyway...

412
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,276
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:17,035
See you.

414
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,398
Go on, leave. Get out!

415
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,001
- But I didn't do anything.
- Next.

416
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,319
Hello.

417
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,236
You?

418
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,602
You think you can get soup?

419
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,439
Please, you're wasting
everyone's time.

420
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,925
I don't want soup.

421
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,647
I can make my own soup.

422
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:42,165
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushrooms...

423
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,238
...half a cup of olive oil...

424
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:46,318
...three pounds celery."

425
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,398
That is my recipe for
wild mushroom.

426
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,521
Yeah, that's right. I got them all.

427
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,326
Cold cucumber,
corn and crab chowder.

428
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,557
- Mulagatani.
- Mulagatani?

429
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,925
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.

430
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,637
No more soup for you.

431
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,479
Next!

432
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,082
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!

433
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,158
- What is it?
- Something happened to Soup Nazi.

434
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,716
- What is the matter?
- Elaine's causing a commotion.

435
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:24,084
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's
gonna drive him out of business.

436
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:27,045
Now that his recipes are out
he's not gonna make any more soup!

437
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,522
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!

438
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,757
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!

439
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,963
- Where you going?
- He's giving away what's left.

440
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,118
I gotta go home and get a big pot.
