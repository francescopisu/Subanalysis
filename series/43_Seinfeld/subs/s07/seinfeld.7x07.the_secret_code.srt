1
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,320
They got us trained
to use the cash machine.

2
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:06,681
We're chickens in an experiment...

3
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:08,917
...waiting for that pellet
to come down the shoot.

4
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:12,358
You see people at the cash machine.
They're just there.

5
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:16,601
Waiting for the sound.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,679
You're waiting for the sound.
That's what we're trained to hear.

7
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,486
The here-comes-the-money sound,
you know?

8
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,156
It's exciting. Don't you get excited?

9
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,837
"It's coming. It's coming.

10
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,237
They're giving me money."

11
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,727
Hey, I gotta get some cash.
I'm gonna run down to the ATM.

12
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:44,077
- Yeah, I gotta grab some too.
- I'll get it for you.

13
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,999
Just give me your card.

14
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,677
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, just tell me your code.

15
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,520
My code?

16
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:58,079
- So why didn't you tell her the code?
- No way.

17
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,398
George, you're gonna
marry this woman, most likely.

18
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,723
It says very clearly,
"For your protection...

19
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,606
...do not give your secret code
to anyone."

20
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,765
So you're taking relationship advice
from Chemical Bank now?

21
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,047
Why does everything have to be "us"?
Is there no "me" left?

22
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,563
Why can't there be some things
just for me? Is that so selfish?

23
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,997
Actually, that's the definition
of selfish.

24
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,720
Have you given your code
to anyone?

25
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:24,078
No one's ever asked. Do you want it?
It's Jor-EI.

26
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,801
- Superman's father on Krypton.
- Of course.

27
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,277
Come on, Georgie,
you know you wanna tell me.

28
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,678
It's eating you up inside.

29
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:33,760
Sing it, sister.

30
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:38,040
No. No, I am not giving my code
to anyone for any reason.

31
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,244
What if my life depended on it?

32
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,245
If you're in some situation where
fast cash will save your life...

33
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,125
...l'll give you the code.

34
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,322
- What's the matter with your leg?
- My foot fell asleep.

35
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,876
- How did your foot fall asleep?
- I crossed my legs.

36
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,719
I forgot to alternate.

37
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,206
- Hey, Jerry, George.
- Hey, Fred.

38
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,005
- Hey, Freddie.
- Foot fell asleep.

39
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,721
You're lucky. At least you got
something to do.

40
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,406
- Hey, Fred, do you know Elaine?
- No.

41
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,001
Nice to meet you. Well, I'm out of here.
See you, guys.

42
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:08,765
- All right, Fred.
- See you.

43
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:12,961
Did you hear that?
He said, "Nice to meet you."

44
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,325
- So?
- So we've met before.

45
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:19,479
At Katie Ash's party.
We talked for, like, 10 minutes.

46
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,439
And he didn't remember you?

47
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:25,716
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go talk to him.

48
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,883
Excuse me. Excuse me, Fred.

49
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,003
- Yeah.
- Hi.

50
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:34,324
You just said, "Nice to meet you,"
but actually we've met before.

51
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:37,087
- We have?
- Yeah. Yeah, at Katie Ash's party.

52
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:38,720
What was your name again?

53
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:41,720
Elaine. You don't remember
our conversation?

54
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,923
I talked about how
my uncle worked...

55
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:46,806
...in the book depository building
with Lee Harvey Oswald.

56
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,041
Not ringing a bell.

57
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:52,085
When my uncle said to him,
"The president's been shot"...

58
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,159
...Oswald winked at him and said,
"I'm gonna go catch a movie."

59
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,123
- No.
- Right when we were in front of...

60
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,676
...the bathroom door.
- The bathroom door.

61
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:05,317
I remember someone had played
tic-tac-toe on it and the X's won.

62
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:09,196
They went diagonally from
the top left to the bottom right.

63
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,243
Sounds great. I'd love to do
some TV commercials.

64
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,920
That should really be fun.

65
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,477
Okay. All right, bye.
How do you like that?

66
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,201
I'm gonna do TV spots
for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store.

67
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,927
That was Leapin' Larry himself.
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

68
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:30,043
Leapin' Larry.
That's where I bought this.

69
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,761
- What is that?
- It's an emergency-band scanner.

70
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:36,556
It picks up everything:
Fires, harbour patrol, even the police.

71
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,287
I'm watching the watchers, Jerry.

72
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,916
We got a big fire on 115th.

73
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:47,602
I tell you, if I could do it over again,
I'd give it all up to be a fireman.

74
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:50,605
Yeah, those civil servants who
risk their lives really got it made.

75
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:54,043
Yeah. When I was a kid,
all I ever dreamed of...

76
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,801
...was steering the back
of that big hook-and-ladder.

77
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,157
You're lucky they let you drive a car.

78
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,317
No, no, no. They're taking
the West Side Highway.

79
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,318
At this time of day? That's insane.

80
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,047
They're heading
straight into gridlock.

81
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,238
Oh, those fools.

82
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,682
What was that? All right.

83
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:15,486
So get a load of this.

84
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,000
This guy, Fred Yerkes...

85
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,046
...remembers every little thing
about that night except me.

86
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,596
Really? I'm surprised.
He doesn't meet that many women.

87
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,526
So, what are you saying?

88
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,720
What's to be said.
He didn't remember you.

89
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:32,760
Yeah, but why? I mean...

90
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:35,880
...you know.

91
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,321
I know.

92
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,404
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

93
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,956
- You got the new catalogue.
- Yeah. Good piece...

94
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,800
...on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
- Too good. Peterman was so pleased...

95
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,401
...now he wants to take me
out to dinner tomorrow.

96
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,876
- Maybe you wanna come.
- Why would I wanna do that?

97
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,645
Please, Jerry.
Please, please, please.

98
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,877
I can't sit with him.
He tells these stories.

99
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,242
It's gonna be awful.

100
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,681
Yeah, sounds like fun.

101
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:02,959
I want you to tell me, George.

102
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:04,765
Why? Why is my code
so important?

103
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,724
Because it's part of our relationship.

104
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:08,559
It's an indication of trust.

105
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,957
We're not supposed to
keep secrets from one another.

106
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,203
I'm sure you have secrets from me.

107
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,927
I don't know anything
about your cycles.

108
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,765
- My cycles?
- I never know what's going on there.

109
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:24,517
Well, from now on,
I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.

110
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,763
- Please.
- Anything else?

111
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,679
We're out of Bosco.

112
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,596
How about this?
"Come on down to Leapin' Larry's.

113
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,923
If you beat our prices,
we'll give you the store."

114
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,359
You know, I've always liked
your comedy.

115
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,360
- You don't take cheap shots.
- No, I don't.

116
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,242
I'm sorry for keeping you so long.
Again, I apologize for the mess.

117
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,842
This renovation is killing me.

118
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,645
My foot's asleep again.

119
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,600
When I lost my leg
in the boating accident last year...

120
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:57,197
...I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic...

121
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,927
...I thought I was gonna have to
give up the business.

122
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:03,284
But now, I'm rejuvenated.

123
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,802
Let me show you around the store.

124
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,527
You know what,
I'll be with you in a minute.

125
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:19,122
That is a great impression.

126
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,878
Larry, wait, you don't understand.

127
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:31,316
I just came from Leapin' Larry's.
What, making fun of crippled people?

128
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:32,886
Is that what you've sunk to?

129
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,760
No, I didn't do it on purpose.
My foot fell asleep.

130
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,366
Oh, your foot fell asleep.

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,606
You know, the guy has one leg and
he still calls himself Leapin' Larry.

132
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,439
You'd think he'd have
a sense of humour.

133
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,117
You just joked yourself out of that
commercial, didn't you, munjamba?

134
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,685
Yeah.

135
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,680
Oh, boy. Look at that.

136
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,042
See, that's that fire
I was listening to yesterday.

137
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,080
The whole building burned down.

138
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,078
They just don't know
what street to take.

139
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,199
Remember I got us to Yankee Stadium
in rush hour in 15 minutes?

140
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,437
- Of course.
- It's all up here, Jerry.

141
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,167
All up here. It's innate.

142
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,756
The amazing thing is
you never have any place to go.

143
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,441
Where are we gonna eat?

144
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,837
We're gonna meet Elaine and
Peterman at the Chinese place.

145
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,038
Nobody mentioned
anything about Peterman.

146
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,885
If I did, would you have gone?

147
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,361
- No way.
- There you go.

148
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,841
I don't even know Peterman.

149
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,567
Now how am I gonna relax?
I'm gonna have to be on all night.

150
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,036
I don't like being on, Jerry.
I'd much rather be off.

151
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,999
Trust me, you're off.

152
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,161
Oh, hi, Fred.

153
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,800
Hello.

154
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,760
- It's Elaine.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

155
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,481
- Yeah. How you doing?
- I'm depressed.

156
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,797
I got this new shirt.
The button fell off.

157
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,686
Once the button falls off, that's it.
I'll never fix it.

158
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,165
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins.

159
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:56,636
- I feel depleted.
- I never take them.

160
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:58,638
They make you nauseous, right?

161
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,884
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
You remembered.

162
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,998
Do you wanna have dinner tonight?

163
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,722
- Tonight?
- What, you have other plans?

164
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:11,199
No, no, no. None that I can...

165
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,278
...remember.

166
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:20,085
All right. You're locked up in a prison
in Turkey. I have your wallet.

167
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,522
The only way I can bribe the guards
to get you out...

168
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,285
...is for you to give me
your ATM code.

169
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,085
- Call the embassy.
- They're closed.

170
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,443
- Why?
- Bomb threat.

171
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,638
- We're in Turkey?
- Midnight Express, my friend.

172
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,476
My card won't work.
They're not on the PLUS system.

173
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,196
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.

174
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,238
Yes. Hi, Mr. Peterman.

175
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,324
This is George Costanza.

176
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:43,806
J. Peterman.

177
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,525
J. Crew.

178
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,205
So is Elaine here?

179
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:54,358
Oh, Elaine just called.
She won't be joining us.

180
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:59,118
But not to worry. I'll tell the maître d'
it'll just be the three bulls.

181
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,523
What? He still wants to have dinner
with us?

182
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,116
- Without Elaine? What for?
- What is he, crazy?

183
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

184
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,285
Come on, weave your web,
liar-man.

185
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:16,763
- I got nothing. L... I'm blank.
- Come on, George...

186
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:19,919
...what's the matter with you?
- I'm choking.

187
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,399
Oh, Fong has been
most accommodating.

188
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,876
- Shall we?
- Actually, I just remembered...

189
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,561
...I promised this comedy club
that I'd do a set tonight.

190
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,560
- I'm terribly sorry.
- I understand. No hard feelings.

191
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,238
George and I
will miss your company.

192
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,001
Fong, it will just
be two this evening.

193
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,839
Well, George...

194
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,677
...we dine.

195
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,239
I can't believe this.
This guy's standing me up?

196
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,247
And there, tucked into the river's bend,
was the object of my search...

197
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,961
...the Guangia River Market.

198
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:04,006
Fabrics and spices
traded under a starlit sky.

199
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:08,004
It was there that I discovered
the Pamplona Beret.

200
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,560
Sizes seven and a half through
eight and three quarters. Price, $35.

201
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:19,124
What about sports?
You follow sports?

202
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,478
It's fourth and inches and
the Giants are going for it.

203
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,877
You've gotta love sports.

204
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,163
You know, this is very nice,
but I really could take a cab, really...

205
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,283
Nonsense, George.

206
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:34,365
Besides, it gives me a chance to
tell you about my trip to Burma.

207
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,805
I discovered a very unusual
corduroy.

208
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,080
Peterman here.

209
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,647
What? Oh, no.

210
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,124
All right. I'll be right there.

211
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,801
It's my mother.
She's at death's door.

212
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,440
- What?
- I just pray to God...

213
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,444
...we can make it there in time.

214
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:00,077
I can't believe you blew us off.
We did you a fav our.

215
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,999
Well, Fred asked me out.

216
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:05,042
- Fred?
- Yeah, and then he stood me up.

217
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,686
I don't get this guy.

218
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,240
You see what's going on here.

219
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:10,682
You're attracted to him because
he can't remember you.

220
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,997
I am? But that's so sick.

221
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,640
That's God's plan.

222
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,241
He doesn't really want anyone
to get together.

223
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,246
Anyway, so how was the dinner?

224
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,525
Well, when I heard
you weren't coming...

225
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,837
...I made an excuse and
got the hell out of there.

226
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,401
What about Georgie?

227
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,516
He didn't make it.

228
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:34,122
- Doctor, how is she?
- She's too weak to talk.

229
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:38,803
- She'll be happy to hear you.
- Mama, it's me, Jacobo.

230
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,123
I'm here for you, Mama.

231
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,363
I'm George Costanza.

232
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:51,042
I was having dinner with your son.

233
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,558
Shake off the dew, my friend.

234
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,206
Oh, man.

235
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,358
- What time is it?
- It's morning.

236
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,677
Thanks for seeing me
through the night.

237
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,724
I'll make us a pot of coffee, George.

238
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,161
Watch her, won't you?

239
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,318
- Who?
- Mama.

240
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,085
Just talk to her, George.

241
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,721
The doctor seems to think it helps.

242
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,722
Hi. You know, l... l...

243
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:36,125
I really should be getting back
to my fiancée. You know, we...

244
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:39,085
We had this big fight yesterday...

245
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:44,321
...and, well, she wants to know
my secret code.

246
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,845
I don't know. I can't tell her.

247
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:54,155
The funny thing is, you know,
I would really love to tell someone...

248
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:56,887
...because it's killing me.

249
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:06,202
You wanna know what it is?

250
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:10,524
It's Bosco.

251
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,439
You know, the chocolate syrup.

252
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:16,441
I love that stuff. I pour it in milk.
It's my favourite drink.

253
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,599
Boy, that is a relief.

254
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,041
Bosco.

255
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,484
Bosco.

256
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,766
- Bosco.
- Mama?

257
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,925
- Quiet, quiet. It's a secret.
- Bosco! Bosco!

258
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:36,478
- Shut up. It's a secret.
- Mama, what are you trying to say?

259
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,803
Bosco.

260
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,684
She's gone.

261
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,797
Bosco?

262
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:56,805
This never would have happened...

263
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,004
...if you hadn't bailed out on me.
- I did not bail out on you.

264
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,044
Why couldn't you include me
in your excuse?

265
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,965
Why didn't you
come up with your own?

266
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:05,799
I froze.

267
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,685
- I think I'm losing it.
- Oh, come on.

268
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,122
- Maybe you're just in a slump.
- No, no.

269
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,279
I reached down
and there was nothing there.

270
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,283
Now Peterman wants me
to go to the funeral.

271
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:19,001
Oh, come on, just tell me
your code already. What is it?

272
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,796
I am not giving you my code.

273
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,445
- I bet I can guess it.
- Yeah, right.

274
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,561
Oh, all right. Yeah.

275
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:31,036
Let's see.

276
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:34,836
Well, we can throw out birthdays
immediately. That's too obvious.

277
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,242
And no numbers for you.
You're a word man.

278
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,165
All right. Let's go deeper.

279
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,883
What kind of man are you?

280
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,322
Well, you're weak, spineless.

281
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,117
A man of temptations.

282
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:48,881
But what tempts you?

283
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,477
You're a portly fellow...

284
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,877
...a little long in the waistband.

285
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,398
So, what's your pleasure?

286
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,927
Is it the salty snacks you crave?

287
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,043
No, no, no.

288
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:05,641
Yours is a sweet tooth.

289
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,396
- Get out of here.
- Oh, you may stray...

290
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,684
...but you'll always return
to your dark master...

291
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,963
...the cocoa bean.

292
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,925
- I'm leaving.
- And only the purest syrup nectar...

293
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:19,440
...can satisfy you.
- I gotta go.

294
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,677
If you could,
you'd guzzle it by the gallon.

295
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:25,886
- Ovaltine, Hershey's, Nestlé's Quik.
- Shut up! Shut up!

296
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,044
- What was that?
- What?

297
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,801
You just checked your watch.
Are you thinking of bailing?

298
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:34,357
I got a date.

299
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,360
- Oh, Mr. Peterman.
- Oh, Elaine.

300
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,006
George.

301
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,846
When Mama said "Bosco"...

302
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,918
...she must have been
communicating something.

303
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,884
Her legacy. A dying wish, perhaps.

304
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,725
Mothers say things.

305
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:51,436
My mother goes babbling on and on
like a crazy person.

306
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:52,881
Mr. Peterman...

307
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,607
...you have my deepest sympathies.

308
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,563
Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.

309
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:02,198
- You do?
- Yes, actually we both do.

310
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,763
I have a personal commitment.

311
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:08,522
- Well, personal... I mean, we both...
- What is it?

312
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,997
I'm speaking at a
woman's rights conference.

313
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:17,805
Yes, and I'm speaking
at a men's conference.

314
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,003
I don't believe that for a minute.

315
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:23,321
- Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
- My pleasure.

316
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:28,481
Fortunately, I still have George here
to help me through this.

317
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:33,684
You know, George, growing up
as a boy in Costa Rica...

318
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,998
...I heard a rumour that
Mama had taken a lover.

319
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,443
Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.

320
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,238
You wanna come to
the fire station with me?

321
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,205
- Fire station?
- Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts.

322
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm gonna rock their world.

323
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,639
I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.

324
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,843
- He took you back?
- Yeah, we straightened it out.

325
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:54,326
- All is forgiven.
- You know...

326
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,842
...the important thing is that
you learned something.

327
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,077
No, I didn't.

328
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,605
Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of shortcuts
is most impressive.

329
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,325
This is just
the Upper West Side.

330
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,119
Wait until I get to the Village.

331
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,642
Then you're gonna see a magic show.

332
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,441
Mr. Kramer, almost every week
some hothead like yourself...

333
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:15,400
...saunters in here
talking about faster routes...

334
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,598
...and snazzier colours for the truck.
- Well, l...

335
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:21,760
The fact is, we feel things are
fine the way they are.

336
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,125
Thanks for having me back and
sorry about the misunderstanding.

337
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,084
Water under the bridge.

338
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,319
Come on. I never did get a chance to
show you around the store.

339
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:32,926
Oh, sure.

340
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,918
Oh, again.

341
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,358
I'll be right there.

342
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,724
Attention, company 390.
Structure fire...

343
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,276
...at Leapin' Larry's
Appliance Warehouse.

344
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,520
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown.
You gotta take Amsterdam.

345
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,236
- Stay out of this, Kramer.
- All right, men, let's move it.

346
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:04,760
Pull those doors.

347
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,598
Move. Move.

348
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:09,678
Giddyup.

349
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,843
Are you okay, cowboy?

350
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:22,356
- Where do you need to go?
- I drive the back of the truck.

351
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,357
You'd better take it easy.

352
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:30,200
All right, 48, let's go. Let's go!

353
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,398
Sorry about the other night.
My mother called.

354
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,922
She couldn't find her pills.
I had to go into Brooklyn...

355
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,203
...help her find the pills
and they were right in...

356
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,279
...the medicine cabinet.
Could you believe that?

357
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,120
The worst part is getting from
the subway station to the house.

358
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,606
There's no transportation.

359
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,479
What am I doing?

360
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:55,277
I'm on a date with this guy
because he didn't remember me?

361
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,960
He's demented. Listen to him.

362
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,403
I could take a cab, but if my mother
saw me in a cab, she would yell at me:

363
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,479
"Freddie, what are you taking
a cab for? It's so expensive."

364
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,041
She's out of her mind.

365
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,721
Eventually, you'll meet her.

366
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:10,204
Bosco.

367
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,157
Bosco.

368
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:15,880
Bosco.

369
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,842
There's a big fire down the street.
The whole block is going up in flames.

370
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:26,046
George.

371
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,558
We're gonna make a left
onto Broadway.

372
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,844
No, I would advise against that.

373
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,963
- Who is this?
- It's Kramer.

374
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,878
Kramer?

375
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,039
What are you doing back there?

376
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,199
Desota's down,
but Cosmo's got the caboose.

377
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,445
- How did this start?
- Beats me.

378
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:54,517
Where the hell is the fire department?
I'm gonna lose the whole store.

379
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,519
Kramer, get the hell out of there.

380
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,598
You're not trained to
operate this equipment.

381
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,485
- Hey, Kramer!
- Hey!

382
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,444
Pay attention, Kramer!

383
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,075
Hey, try the scanner.
See if you can pick up anything.

384
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,277
What are you doing, Kramer?
You're all over the road.

385
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,359
- Don't worry, cap, I can handle it.
- Kramer?

386
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,519
You're losing control.

387
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,679
Hard right! Hard right!

388
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,357
We're never gonna to mak e it!

389
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,245
That's a shame.

390
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,722
This fire's gonna eat up
this entire block.

391
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,801
George, look. There's a man in there.

392
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,366
Get out. You're in danger.

393
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,678
My sleeve, it's stuck in the machine.
It ate my card.

394
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:42,405
George, give me your ATM card.

395
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,319
I don't have my ATM card.

396
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,762
George, you're obviously lying.
Anyone can see that.

397
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,000
It's jammed.

398
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,601
I'll slide it under the door.

399
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,358
- Now give me your code.
- What? Why?

400
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,324
The machine won't open
without the code.

401
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,085
- George, give him your code.
- But l...

402
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,761
George, there's no time.
Tell him your code.

403
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,440
Shout out your code, man.

404
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,002
Code! The code!

405
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,124
Hi.

406
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,641
- Here's your cash, George.
- Thanks.

407
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,206
And here's your card back.

408
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,077
Anyone for Bosco?

409
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,557
Oh, my God.

410
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,445
- Look at this.
- What?

411
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,723
It's the new J. Peterman catalogue.
Look, look.

412
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:44,726
"The Rogue's Wallet.

413
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,323
It's where he kept his card,
his dirty little secret.

414
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:51,479
Short, devious, balding...

415
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,115
...his name was Costanza.

416
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,517
He killed my mother."
