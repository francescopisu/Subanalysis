1
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,278
Gum is one of the weirdest
human inventions.

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,722
It's not a liquid. It's not a solid.
It's not a food.

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,681
What is it?
It isn't really anything.

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:16,045
You know, I mean, it's like
a stationary bike for your jaw.

5
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:19,085
Remember when you were in school
and teachers would get riled up...

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,600
...if they caught you with gum?

7
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,962
When you're a kid,
you think what's the big deal?

8
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,606
As an adult, I can understand it...

9
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:28,442
...because when you're chewing gum,
you don't look thrilled with anything.

10
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,996
World War II, that was
an important historical event?

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,566
Yeah, I'm sure.

12
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,603
They landed a man
on the moon in 1969?

13
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,405
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,683
Yeah, I buy that, teach.

15
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,323
Do you think she's happy?

16
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:54,360
- Who?
- The cashier.

17
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,797
- Ruthie Cohen?
- You know her name?

18
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:58,956
Sure.

19
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,085
- I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
- Maybe that's why she's happy.

20
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,083
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- What is this?

21
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:11,365
Well, it's the latest offering
from the Alex Theatre.

22
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:15,679
- That stinky old movie house?
- Well, you should smell it now.

23
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:18,441
- We fixed up the place.
- With Spartacus?

24
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,360
Well, it's a rare archival print.

25
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:26,635
Twelve extra minutes,
full wide-screen Cinemascope.

26
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:30,880
And if you come to the 1:00 show,
you can hear Jeffrey Haarwood.

27
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,476
- Jeffrey who?
- Haarwood.

28
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,560
He was the assistant
wardrobe man on Spartacus.

29
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:39,241
He has some fascinating insights
into the production.

30
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:42,997
Why would you spend $7 to see
a movie that I could watch on TV?

31
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,725
Well, why go to a fine restaurant...

32
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,162
...when you can just stick something
in the microwave?

33
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:52,276
Why go to the park and fly a kite
when you can just pop a pill?

34
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,045
You guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun,
have you? I'm supposed to meet him.

35
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:57,686
Lloyd Braun? What for?

36
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,281
Well, he's using his connections
in the mayor's office...

37
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:02,597
...to get the theatre landmark status.

38
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,758
I thought he screwed up
the Dinkins campaign.

39
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:08,283
Well, he did. After that,
he had a nervous breakdown.

40
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,007
Had to spend a few months
in an institution.

41
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:14,279
- Really?
- Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now.

42
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:16,961
- I've taken him under my wing.
- Oh, then I'm not worried.

43
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:18,958
But he still needs all of our support.

44
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,801
When he gets here,
treat him like he's one of the gang.

45
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,161
Breakdown, huh?

46
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,397
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Lloyd. Hey, buddy.

47
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,364
- How you doing? Hi, Jerry.
- Lloyd.

48
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,882
- George.
- Hello, Lloyd.

49
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,562
- How you doing?
- Well, he's doing fine, George.

50
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,083
- Gum.
- That's an interesting package.

51
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:37,805
Yeah, it's from China.

52
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,195
Go ahead, try a piece.

53
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,165
Tell me that's not the most
delicious gum you've ever tasted.

54
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:47,082
Yes, yes, we shall all try a piece
and tell you how delicious it is.

55
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,876
- George.
- I don't chew gum.

56
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,199
It's different. Where did you get it?

57
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,323
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave it to me.

58
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,842
- I can ask him where he got it.
- No, don't bother.

59
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,486
- It's no problem.
- I don't want it.

60
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,603
Jerry, Lloyd says it's no problem.

61
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,884
He's capable of locating the gum.

62
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:09,003
- All right.
- Boy, this is... This is delicious.

63
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,445
You know what? I think this Ruthie
Cohen gave me the wrong change.

64
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:21,121
Didn't I pay with a 20?
I'm sure I paid with a 20.

65
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:25,166
I think I finally figured out
what the flavour is in this gum.

67
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,477
It's a little lo meiny.

68
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,284
- What kind is that?
- It's Chinese gum.

69
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,962
- Lloyd Braun gave it to me.
- Lloyd Braun. How's he doing?

70
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:37,244
After Dinkins lost the election,
he had a complete nervous breakdown.

71
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,159
They had to lock him up.

72
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,443
That's around the same time
I broke up with Lloyd.

73
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,565
You don't think that I had anything
to do with his breakdown, do you?

74
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:48,117
I remember, when we parted company,
I was babbling incoherently for months.

75
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,039
Yeah, well, I've got news for you.

76
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,880
While I was growing up
all I heard from my mother was:

77
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,436
"Why can't you be more
like that Lloyd Braun?"

78
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:58,201
And in the end, Lloyd Braun
became more like you.

79
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,281
- Right, gotta get going.
- Aren't you coming to Spartacus?

80
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,483
I gotta deliver Christmas
presents to my parents.

81
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:07,117
- I thought they were out of town.
- Why do you think I'm going now?

82
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:12,882
- Georgie.
- Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

83
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,526
Back in the old neighbourhood, huh?

84
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,962
Yeah, yeah, just delivering
some presents to my folks.

85
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,243
Oh, snazzy car.

86
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,201
- LeBaron?
- Yeah, '83.

87
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,959
It used to belong to Jon Voight.

88
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,846
- The actor, right?
- Something like that.

89
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,237
- Mind if I look under the hood?
- No, go ahead, Pop.

90
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,967
- You always knew your cars.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,243
Oh, Deena, Deena.
Deena, look who's here.

92
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,366
- George Costanza, is that you?
- Hey, Deena. Come on, give us a hug.

93
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,246
Oh, my gosh, you look as pretty
as you did back in high school.

94
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,477
Boy, those were some crazy times.

95
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,925
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy,
did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

96
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:53,879
The Alex was built in 1922, during
the golden age of movie palaces.

97
00:04:54,047 --> 00:05:00,600
Minor restorations in
1941, '47, '52, '58, '63...

98
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,601
...and currently to our present
period of time.

99
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,678
- You're really getting into this?
- I am.

100
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:10,396
The icing on the cake would be
that landmark status from the city.

101
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,081
We're hoping Lloyd Braun
can pull a few strings.

102
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,680
Oh, can on Lloyd really do that?

103
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,681
Lloyd Braun can do anything
he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.

104
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,360
You should
say hello to him, Elaine.

105
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,279
What? Lloyd's here?
No, no, I'd rather...

106
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,360
- Hi, Elaine.
- Lloyd. Yes, hello.

107
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,562
Did Kramer tell you?

108
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,446
We reserved some special seats
so we can all sit together.

109
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, well, actually, Lloyd, Jerry and I
have to sit in the front row...

110
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,242
...because...
Because he forgot his glasses.

111
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:46,322
So thanks for getting us the...
We'll see you afterwards.

112
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:47,761
Come on.

113
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,358
That was odd.

114
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,400
Am I crazy
or does Jerry not wear glasses?

115
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,604
You're not crazy.
Jerry does wear glasses.

116
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,997
He just forgot them, that's all.

117
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,845
Not crazy.

118
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:07,284
We're all the way in the front row?
Couldn't we sit in the special seats?

119
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,484
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd
thinking I was leading him on again.

120
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:13,320
Seeing him made me feel
very uncomfortable.

121
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:20,847
No, you don't want
to be uncomfortable.

122
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:25,485
- Poor Lloyd.
- I know. Completely bonkers.

123
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm sorry I can't be so flip
about this kind of thing.

124
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,323
You know, after what
happened to Pop.

125
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,325
Pop? What happened to Pop?

126
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,159
I thought you heard.

127
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,999
He had a nervous breakdown
last year.

128
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,680
That's why I'm taking care of him.

129
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,077
I tell you, they don't build them
like this anymore.

130
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:47,001
He doesn't have
the auto shop anymore?

131
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,078
It was too much for him.

132
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,401
- I gotta go.
- What?

133
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,683
I just remembered
I gotta be someplace.

134
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,963
That's enough, Pop.
Put down the wrench, Pop.

135
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,444
Pop! Pop!

136
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,522
- Great movie, huh?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:29,804
- Sorry you forgot those glasses.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

138
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,721
- How did you like that gum?
- He loved it.

139
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,526
Kramer, you know,
there isn't a light in the ladies room.

140
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,678
Yeah, it's being repaired.

141
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,161
Oh, God.

142
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,798
- You all right?
- I sat too close to the screen.

143
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,722
I just gotta stretch out
in a hot bath.

144
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,117
It was nice see you again, Lloyd.

145
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,806
Officer. Officer, is there some reason
this man has too be using a hose.

146
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,599
I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk.

147
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,645
It's a waste of water.
Couldn't he just use a broom?

148
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,399
Lady, you sold me.

149
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,886
Hey, you with the hose.

150
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,201
Here, put these glasses on.

151
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,927
- What's this for?
- Lloyd's gonna be here any minute.

152
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,204
- So what?
- Well, he thinks you wear those.

153
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
They're from the lost and found
at the Alex.

154
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,396
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna put these on.

155
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,795
Oh, okay.

156
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,004
So he'll just think that the two of you
didn't sit with him on purpose.

157
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,477
Oh, yeah, that's very nice.
Very nice.

158
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,280
Excuse me,
I was in here this morning...

159
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,041
...and I believe I paid you
with a 20-dollar bill...

160
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:49,165
...but you only gave me
change for a 10.

161
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,557
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I think so.

162
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:52,955
And I can prove it.

163
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:54,719
You see, I was doodling
on the bill...

164
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:58,323
...and so if you have a 20 in there
with big lips on it...

165
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,476
...well, that's mine.

166
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,399
Would you mind
opening up the register?

167
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,920
Not unless you buy something.

168
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:07,158
Okay. Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.

169
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,919
Hey, George.

170
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,961
- Thought you didn't chew gum.
- I don't.

171
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,606
Take a look.

172
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:20,885
I know I gave it to you.

173
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,958
George, you mind?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

174
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,484
Fine, fine. Excuse me.

175
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,957
Think I'm gonna forget about this?
I haven't forgotten. I don't forget easily.

176
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:36,363
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.

177
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,836
- Oh, Lloyd.
- Hi, Jerry.

178
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,567
- Got some more of that gum.
- Oh, the gum.

179
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,521
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

180
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,759
- All right.
- Oh, boy.

181
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:47,916
Sit down.

182
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,079
Yeah, now, see, this is what
the holidays are all about.

183
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,886
Three buddies sitting around
chewing gum, huh?

184
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:57,720
Yeah.

185
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,520
So, you know, Lloyd,
he thinks he can get more of this.

186
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,958
Well, Lloyd
is a very industrious fellow.

187
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:07,597
I'm sure he can accomplish anything
he sets his mind to.

188
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,038
Actually, the importer
is right in Chinatown.

189
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:12,402
I'll introduce you.
You can get it get it whenever.

190
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,319
It's not necessary.

191
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:17,081
Hey, Jerry, you know,
Lloyd wants to do you a favour.

192
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:18,999
I know that, Kramer.

193
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,078
- Lf you don't want to...
- Sure, he wants to.

194
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,683
And it's very kind of you.
Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it.

195
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:28,396
- Don't you, Jerry?
- Yes, I do, Kramer.

196
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,683
- So how about that Elaine today?
- Oh, baby.

197
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,407
What is that all about, huh?

198
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,206
She was practically undressing
in front of me at the theatre.

199
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,360
- I didn't see anything.
- You really missed a show, buddy.

200
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,679
Yeah.

201
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:57,558
You're probably wondering
why I wanted to see you again.

202
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:58,962
Well, you know...

203
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,284
It's understandable.

204
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,720
I'm glad you feel that way.

205
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:08,196
Because since my father's
breakdown...

206
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,597
...l've become very sensitive
to the warning signs.

207
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:15,877
- Warning signs?
- Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

208
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,719
What?

209
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,885
What are you talking about?
I'm not the one with the problem.

210
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,607
Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse,
not me.

211
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,839
Yeah, and taking pleasure
in the misfortunes of others.

212
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,766
- All my friends do that.
- George, I'm only trying help.

213
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,246
I'm concerned.

214
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:32,876
George?

215
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,882
- Are you listening to me?
- Do you see that woman?

216
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,640
She stole $20 from me.

217
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:45,241
I might have gotten it back,
but Lloyd Braun interfered.

218
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,796
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

219
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,286
Hey. Hey, you!

220
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:53,235
Get back here!
Don't gallop away. I'm on to you.

221
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,439
So you're saying
she was on a horse?

222
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:02,123
I'm telling you, that cashier
is riding horses on my money.

223
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,925
Well, here's what I propose.

224
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:05,918
Go down to the stables,
snoop around.

225
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:10,638
See if any high-flying cashier has been
throwing $20 bills around with big lips.

226
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,881
- Hey.
- Well, if it isn't Chesty Larue.

227
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:18,323
- What?
- I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun.

228
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,842
He was bragging about
the show you gave him at the Alex.

229
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,046
Oh, God. I lost a button,
so my blouse was wide open.

230
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:26,606
I must've left it at the theatre.

231
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,564
- Maybe it's in the lost and found.
- I know.

232
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,877
I have to go check it out.
It's a beautiful button.

233
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:32,765
It's antique ivory.
It was my mother's.

234
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:36,044
You know, the way you were wolfing
down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.

235
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,679
Mr. Haarwood, what an unexpected
surprise to have you back at the Alex.

236
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:45,362
Well, I'm in a bit of a quandary.
I've misplaced my spectacles.

237
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:48,485
Well, let's look in lost and found,
shall we?

238
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,200
They're half glasses.

239
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,197
- Brown?
- Yes, yes.

240
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:58,279
Yeah, well, if they're not in the box,
I'm sure they'll turn up soon.

241
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,279
Listen, could you keep
an eye on the place?

242
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,085
I wanna go get some paraffin wax...

243
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:05,205
...and bring out the lustre
of this vintage countertop.

244
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,164
Yes, certainly.

245
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,078
Oh, my goodness.

246
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:14,999
What a spanking button.

247
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,440
All right, all right.

248
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,527
Hang on. It's warming up.

249
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,322
Hey, what is your problem?

250
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh, hello. It's you.

251
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,281
Listen, lady, I've got
six minutes left on that meter...

252
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,359
...and I'm not budging until
you admit you stole my $20.

253
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:50,359
You're not so stuff tough when you're
not on your horse, are you, Ruthie?

254
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,040
Your car's on fire.

255
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,286
Merry Christmas.

256
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,039
Fire!

257
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,004
- Your hose! Where's your hose?
- The cop made me disconnect it.

258
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:17,719
What happened to your car, buddy?

259
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,077
The Jon Voight car is no more.

260
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:25,524
Well, don't you sweat it. You can
use my car anytime you want to.

261
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,197
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

262
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,597
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

263
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,326
- Yeah, merry Christmas.
- Whatever.

264
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,920
- All right. I'm here. Where's Braun?
- What? He's not here yet?

265
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,806
Look. I'll go downtown to Chinatown
with him, but that is it.

266
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,685
- I need those glasses.
- Why?

267
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,042
They're Jeffrey Haarwood's.

268
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,882
Here, try this pair.

269
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,962
Wow, these are really...

270
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,760
Hey, gum-buddy. Nice frames.

271
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,487
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah.

272
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,603
Yeah, he's all ready to go.

273
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,804
- Anybody see Elaine today?
- Oh, yeah, she called a little earlier.

274
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,800
She's coming over
to check out lost and found.

275
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,841
Maybe I'll stick around
and see what she's wearing today.

276
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,759
Or not wearing,
if you know what I mean.

277
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,838
Absolutely, let's just stick around.

278
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,804
I'll tell you what,
they're expecting us.

279
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,401
- Let me just grab a hot dog here.
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,276
I'd like a hot dog, please.

281
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,806
Are you out of your mind?

282
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,399
What's the problem here?

283
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,035
This hot dog's been here
since the silent era.

284
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:37,119
- You'd have to be insane to eat it.
- No, no, this man is not insane.

285
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,845
There's nothing wrong
with it or you.

286
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,520
- Kramer...
- No, no, I'll show you.

287
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,885
- One hot dog, please.
- Okay.

288
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,722
Doesn't that smell good, huh?

289
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,878
Here we go. Yeah.

290
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,956
Oh, that's delicious.

291
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,880
This is a perfectly sane food to eat.

292
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,322
Interesting texture.

293
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,364
It's chewy.

294
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:06,196
I gotta get some air.

295
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:26,725
Excuse me. Excuse me.

296
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,003
Weren't you told
to stop using that hose?

297
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,241
- How would you happen to know that?
- Well...

298
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:36,444
You're that lady that was
talking to the cops, aren't you?

299
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:43,119
- Hey, Joe!
- Oh, wait, wait! Stop it!

300
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,964
- Hey, everybody.
- Whoa, Elaine!

301
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:52,120
Once again you've managed
to top yourself.

302
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,886
Come on, Jerry, let's go.
The car is out front.

303
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,319
Lloyd.

304
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,841
Lloyd.

305
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,202
What is Lloyd's problem?

306
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,200
Look, honey, I know you're trying
to get Lloyd to notice you...

307
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,800
...but this is too much.

308
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,636
Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

309
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:26,399
I got sprayed with a hose.

310
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,161
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but the Alex is a family theatre...

311
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,124
...not one of your swing joints.

312
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,879
So you want my father
to pay for this?

313
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,197
Well, you saw him.
He was fiddling with the engine.

314
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,800
God knows what he did there.

315
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,686
And I suppose Lloyd Braun
had something to do with it too?

316
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,998
- Not Lloyd Braun, but the cashier.
- What cashier?

317
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,204
You remember the woman
on the horse? She wanted my spot.

318
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,401
- To park her horse?
- No, she wasn't on the horse.

319
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,361
So your car caught fire...

320
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,519
...because of my father
and the woman on the horse.

321
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:04,520
That's right. And him.

322
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,002
- The man with the flowers?
- Yeah, yeah, the flower guy.

323
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,079
Listen, I know this all sounds
a little crazy, but...

324
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:12,999
I can't believe it.
That's Jerry Seinfeld.

325
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,805
- Who?
- Jerry Seinfeld, my best friend.

326
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,083
He can explain all of this.
Jerry, Jerry!

327
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,477
Over here, Jerry. It's me!

328
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:22,366
Where are you going?
It's... What are you...?

329
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,766
- That was your best friend?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,078
- But he doesn't wear glasses.
- That man was wearing glasses.

331
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,080
Don't you see? He was doing it
to fool Lloyd Braun.

332
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,046
I'll run in and get the gum.

333
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,198
- All right.
- Got any money?

334
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,558
Here.

335
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,719
I'll be back.

336
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,557
Look, Deena, I know you think
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

337
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,400
This is just a series
of bad coincidences.

338
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,717
I don't know, George.
I don't know what to believe.

339
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,723
Believe me, I am not crazy.

340
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,960
Well, I guess it's possible.

341
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,204
Here you go.

342
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,959
- All this?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,005
- A hundred dollars worth.
- I gave you a hundred dollars?

344
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,395
You sure did.

345
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:28,242
- Am I crazy or is that a lot of gum?
- It's a lot of gum!

346
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,563
Mr. Haarwood, I found your glasses.

347
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,206
Oh, splendid.

348
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,756
Welcome to the
Institute for the Preservation...

349
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,885
...of Motion Picture Costumes
and Wardrobes.

350
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,277
The I.P.M.P.C.W.

351
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,197
We prefer to call it the Institute.

352
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,483
- Is that from Henry VIII?
- Yes, yes, it is.

353
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,320
Yeah, well, you know, we're
screening that tonight at the Alex.

354
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,921
You think that I could wear
that to promote the theatre?

355
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:56,079
Well, I'd love to lend it to you,
but I doubt if it would fit a man...

356
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,717
...of your impressive
Raymond Massey-like physique.

357
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,959
The only person who could
really fit into this costume...

358
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:07,484
...would have to be a short, stocky man
of somewhat generous proportion.

359
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,563
You don't say.

360
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,563
You're really helping
me out with this, buddy.

361
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:17,799
- Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,356
You really cashed in
on that favour pretty quick.

363
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:23,485
Remember, you are a king.
You must project a royal bearing.

364
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,115
Oh, I'm going to give you
a royal bearing.

365
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,961
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let me get a pack of gum.

366
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,316
Can I get a pack of gum, please?

367
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,239
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty...

368
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,126
...but we don't accept bills
with lipstick on the president.

369
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,560
What?

370
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:46,166
So I had it all along.
How do you like that?

371
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,125
I guess I owe that cashier
an apology.

372
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,842
Oh, my God.

373
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,882
No, no, Deena,
it's not what you think.

374
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:00,515
This isn't mine.
I got it from the Institute.

375
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:02,837
The Institute!

376
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:14,521
Mr. Haarwood.

377
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,076
Well, you certainly know
how to dress for a premiere.

378
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,396
Well, thank you.

379
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,276
- Where is your friend, King Henry?
- He ran away.

380
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,520
- Hey, Kramer.
- Let me talk to you.

381
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:28,281
You know, that button
looks very familiar.

382
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,483
Yes, it's antique ivory.

383
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,966
I think that's my button.

384
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:33,958
You know, I've been
looking all over for it.

385
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,397
- Did you find it here?
- It was in the lost and found.

386
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,040
- Shall I undo it?
- Yes, of course.

387
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,199
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm a little ticklish.

388
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,039
Tickle, tickle.

389
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,922
We really gotta get
that Elaine a boyfriend.

390
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,884
Oh, tell me about it.
