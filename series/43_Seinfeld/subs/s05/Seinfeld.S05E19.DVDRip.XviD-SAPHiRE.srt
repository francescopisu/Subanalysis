411
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,386
When are they leaving?

412
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,319
In two days.

413
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,494
- It's been so long.
- I know.

414
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,425
Okay.

415
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,133
- It's only two more days.
- Right.

416
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,199
Thursday, 3:00.

417
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,110
- Oh, hi.
- We didn't know you had company.

418
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,144
Yeah. This is Rachel.

419
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,872
- Hi.
- Hello, Rachel.

420
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,313
- We'll come back another time.
- What other time?

421
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,952
- Whenever.
- Where you going?

422
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,850
- We'll drive around for a while.
- You don't have a car.

423
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,014
- We'll take a bus.
- Come on. Stop.

424
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,783
- No, we don't mind.
- I'll get a book.

425
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,326
No, it's okay.
I was just leaving anyway.

426
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,589
Are you sure?
Because we don't wanna-

427
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,130
No, it's okay.

428
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,734
<i>- We'll go see Schindler's List, right?
- Definitely.</i>

429
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,300
Okay.

430
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,006
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

431
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,800
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

432
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,908
Boy, that was some show.

433
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,272
<i>- What show?
- My Fair Lady.</i>

434
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,280
- When did you get tickets to see that?
- Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.

435
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,385
Oh, Elaine? Really?

436
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,646
Well, that sounds interesting.

437
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,689
We saw Regis Philbin
get out of a limousine.

438
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,688
He looks better on TV.

439
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,832
- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry.

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,195
- Yeah?
- It's Jack Klompus.

441
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,996
Oh, hi, Jack.

442
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,839
So when are you coming down
to Florida again?

443
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,033
As soon as is humanly possible.

444
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,339
You know, I still got that pen,
the one that writes upside down.

445
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,574
Yeah. I should have kept it.

446
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,719
- So where's your father?
- Oh, he's right here.

447
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,719
<i>- Yeah?
- Hello, Morty.</i>

448
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,387
Listen, I can't get in the garage.

449
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,620
<i>- What do you mean?
- There is something...</i>

450
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,094
...wrong with the key.
The key doesn't work.

451
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,825
- You gotta jiggle it a little bit.
- I jiggled it.

452
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,162
I jiggled it for 15 minutes.

453
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,828
Tell him to come down here
and get his own packages.

454
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,600
You have nothing better to do
than worry about his boxes?

455
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,641
You gotta pull on the knob
as you turn it.

456
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,540
Get the hell out of here
with your knob!

457
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,112
What does he want from you?

458
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,374
My idiot son could open
that garage door.

459
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,412
What did I do?

460
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,020
Just do it first thing tomorrow.
I need it.

461
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,748
They'll be here first thing
Thursday morning.

462
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,792
Thursday morning?
You know we're leaving at 3:00.

463
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,055
Yeah, you're leaving at 3:00.

464
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,597
- How will you get this done?
- Don't worry about it.

465
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,201
Yeah, how you gonna get
all this done in time?

466
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,404
They were drinking
champagne in a buggy!

467
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,132
- First Kramer, then Elaine?
- Yeah.

468
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,902
- It's a slap in the face.
- What did we ever do to them?

469
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,980
I wanna know what we did to them.

470
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,640
What are they, too good for us?
A raincoat salesman.

471
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,946
- I could buy and sell him, like that.
- The hell with them!

472
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,613
The thing that bothers me the most
is the lying.

473
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,025
Well, let's forget about it.

474
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,856
We're going on a beautiful vacation.

475
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,427
Vacation?

476
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,590
Your mother and I are planning
on taking a cruise.

477
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,761
But I can't find any
of my vacation clothes.

478
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,372
They were in the attic.

479
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,472
The attic?

480
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,075
You haven't worn any
of those clothes for years.

481
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,213
How can I go on a cruise
without my cabana-wear?

482
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,350
I love those clothes.

483
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,382
A mouse! I saw a mouse!

484
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,354
It's the remote.

485
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,656
Where the hell are my clothes?
I love those clothes.

486
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,396
Lousy, moth-ridden crap.

487
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,768
I'm not crazy about used clothes.
I mean, they call it vintage...

488
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,534
...you know, to take your mind
off what it really is, nasty-wear.

489
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,912
Oh, it's clean, you know.
People wear underwear.

490
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,240
Yeah, well, they don't
wear iron underwear.

491
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,316
And that's what it's gonna take
to get me in those clothes.

492
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,716
I'll move into an apartment
after a strange person moves out.

493
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,584
Why would I wanna move
into somebody's pants?

494
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,453
There is no vintage underwear,
of course.

495
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,186
But it's not because a guy
couldn't sell his underwear.

496
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,195
It's because men
wear their underwear...

497
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,994
...until it absolutely disintegrates.

498
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:08,332
Men hang onto underwear
until each individual...

499
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,805
...underwear molecule
is so strained...

500
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,467
...it can barely retain
the properties of a solid.

501
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,738
It actually becomes
underwear vapor.

502
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,416
We don't even throw it out.
We just open a window...

503
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,677
...and it goes out
like dandelion spores.

504
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,720
That's how men throw out underwear.
We go- Then it's gone.

505
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,653
That's it. It's just...

506
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,893
- Hey, Jerry.
- So how was the movie?

507
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,757
Oh, really good. Really good.

508
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,296
- Didn't three hours go by like that?
- Like that.

509
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,766
What about the end, with the list?

510
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,568
Yeah, that was some list.

511
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,105
What'd you think
of the black and white?

512
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,333
The black and white?

513
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,704
The whole movie
was in black and white.

514
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,907
Oh, yeah, I didn't even realize.

515
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,685
You don't think about it.
There's so much going on.

516
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,789
Yeah. Yeah. I tell you,
I could see it again.

517
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,658
So Klompus has the key,
but the jerk couldn't open it up.

518
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,324
All you gotta do is jiggle it. You just
get it in there, jiggle it, jiggle it.

519
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,197
Look, I find this whole thing
very uninteresting.

520
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,068
- When you get the coats, come in.
- Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm on your side.

521
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,708
Hey. What, again?

522
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,071
I'm trying to buy some
of the clothes back.

523
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,179
Hey, wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

524
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,111
My mother made
all this extra paella.

525
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,978
Paella? Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,985
Apparently, the Seinfelds
are too good for us.

527
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,622
I shouldn't say anything bad
about your partner.

528
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,726
No, no. We're not really partners.
I only get 25 percent.

529
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,793
Twenty-five percent?
It was your idea.

530
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,797
- Yeah, I know.
- You're doing all the legwork.

531
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,958
- That's right.
- He's ripping you off.

532
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,537
- You're right. He's ripping me off.
- You should be getting more.

533
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,971
- He's ripping me off.
- Don't let him take advantage of you.

534
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,047
Oh, it's you.

535
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,740
You're the one who sold me
the moth-ridden cabana crap.

536
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,922
You know, I've been thinking...

537
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,216
...why is Kramer getting 25 percent?

538
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,053
Well, he told you about the place.

539
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,058
So what?
Why is that worth 25 percent?

540
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,925
It's a finder's fee.
You know what a finder's fee is?

541
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,066
You find something, you get a fee.

542
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,361
A finder's fee is 10 percent,
no more.

543
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,060
Well, it's too late now.

544
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,430
Those are my coats.
I saved them, I stored them.

545
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,337
I've been waiting years
for this payoff.

546
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,910
Well, you're not gonna say anything.

547
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,603
Hey.

548
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,116
- I've been thinking about something.
- Yeah, so have I-

549
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,946
- I don't think the deal is fair.
- You don't think it's fair?

550
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,748
No, no. I found the place.
I set the whole thing up.

551
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,118
- I'm doing all the legwork.
- What legwork?

552
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,988
- There's legwork.
- If anything, you're getting too much.

553
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,357
- Too much?
- That's right. They're my coats.

554
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,896
Okay, look, I want 35 percent.

555
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,533
I'm thinking more like 15.

556
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,135
- No way I'm taking 15.
- Well, you're not getting 35!

557
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,135
All right, let's compromise.

558
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,534
- Twenty-five percent.
- Okay, it's a deal.

559
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,711
Moths are the scourge of my business.
All it takes is one moth to lay eggs.

560
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,475
Know what happens to the larvae?
They hatch everywhere.

561
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,050
Well, I'm sorry.

562
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,619
Here's your money back.
And I'll take the clothes.

563
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,450
This will hardly put a dent
in my fumigation bill.

564
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,889
- So where are the clothes?
- I burned them.

565
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,996
That's good.

566
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,890
Now, I know they're
your parents, Jerry...

567
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,660
...and they're very nice people.

568
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,966
But don't you think it's odd...

569
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,973
...that a 35-year-old man
is going to these lengths...

570
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,010
...to see that someone else's parents
are enjoying themselves?

571
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,511
I mean, don't you
find that abnormal?

572
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,377
It is a tad askew.

573
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,054
I mean, they're your parents,
and you don't do anything.

574
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,519
Why's this stranger doing it?

575
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,157
I've hardly been out with them.

576
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,623
See? See?
And I can't even say anything...

577
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,456
...you know, because
all he's really doing is being nice...

578
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,258
...but nobody's this nice.
This is, like...

579
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:32,027
- ...certifiably nice.
- You're right. He's insane.

580
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,263
Yes, he's insane.
That's what I think.

581
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,538
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

582
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,438
I don't know what to do.

583
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,474
Oh, God. So how was the movie?

584
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,707
From what I saw, it was pretty good.

585
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,578
What do you mean,
"from what you saw"?

586
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,381
Well, I didn't actually get
to see the whole movie.

587
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,047
Yeah, why not?

588
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,953
I was kind of making out.

589
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,269
<i>You were making out
during Schindler's List?</i>

590
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,869
I couldn't help it.

591
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,904
We hadn't been alone in a long time.
It got the better of me.

592
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,373
<i>- During Schindler's List?
- We're both living with our parents.</i>

593
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,240
Did anybody see you
or say anything?

594
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,439
Oh, I don't think so.
I saw Newman, but he didn't see me.

595
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,420
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

596
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,657
Hello, Newman.

597
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,032
Jerry's not here.

598
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,760
Having a nice trip?

599
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,272
Wonderful. We went to
the theater last night.

600
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,170
Oh, the theater.

601
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,106
- Because I was wondering-
- Wondering what?

602
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,679
<i>Why I didn't see you
at Schindler's List with Jerry.</i>

603
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,077
Well, we already saw it.

604
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,845
Oh, well, it's a good thing
for Jerry that you didn't go.

605
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,180
- Why is that?
- Well, he really seemed to have...

606
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,518
...his hands full,
if you know what I mean?

607
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,193
I'm afraid I don't.

608
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,295
Him and his buxom little friend,
Rachel...

609
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,556
...were going at it pretty good
in the balcony.

610
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,723
- What?
- Do I have to spell it out for you?

611
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,530
He was moving on her
like the stormtroopers into Poland.

612
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,700
<i>Jerry was necking
during Schindler's List?</i>

613
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,103
Yes.

614
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,575
And a more offensive spectacle
I cannot recall.

615
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,341
Anyway, I just really came up
to get some detergent.

616
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,417
- Jerry sends his laundry out.
- Oh, right.

617
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,987
Well, it was nice seeing you folks.
Oh, by the way...

618
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,421
...you didn't hear this from me.
Ta-ta.

619
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,765
Hi.

620
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,404
- What? What did I do?
- How could you?

621
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,842
- How could I what?
- You were making out...

622
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,845
<i>...during Schindler's List?</i>

623
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,547
What?

624
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,151
- No.
- Don't lie, Jerry.

625
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,978
Newman.

626
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,324
- How could you do such a thing?
- I couldn't help it.

627
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,123
We hadn't been alone together
in a long time.

628
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,732
We started up a little
during the coming attractions...

629
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,131
...and the next thing we knew
the war was over.

630
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,000
<i>- Hello.
- Jerry.</i>

631
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,144
- It's Jack Klompus.
- Hang on a second.

632
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,406
Dad, it's Klompus.

633
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,516
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Morty?</i>

634
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,787
Listen. That key doesn't work.

635
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,549
- It's no good.
- You didn't get in?

636
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,091
Oh, I got in.
I had to break the window with a rock.

637
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,526
And then I got my hand
all cut up reaching in.

638
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,894
- You broke the window?
- He broke the window?

639
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,127
You wanted those damn boxes,
didn't you?

640
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,534
He should be on his hands
and knees thanking you.

641
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,174
<i>- Did you send them?
- Yeah.</i>

642
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,539
They'll be there
tomorrow afternoon, 2:00.

643
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,236
Tomorrow afternoon?

644
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,813
- Tomorrow afternoon?
- Tomorrow afternoon?

645
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,814
I told you to send them express.

646
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,386
It was $10 cheaper
in the afternoon than the morning.

647
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,386
I figured, what the hell's
the difference?

648
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,049
- What did you do about the window?
- I gotta fix your window now?

649
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,922
All right, all right. Goodbye.

650
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,392
I don't think we'll make that flight.

651
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,261
What do you mean
you won't make it?

652
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,868
We have to make the flight.
We're with a charter group.

653
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,334
If we don't, the trip is off.

654
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,700
What's the difference?
We'll go some place else.

655
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,739
Someplace else?
What about Paris?

656
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,242
You don't understand.
I've come this far. I can't stop now.

657
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,213
I can't believe that you're doing all this
just to sell some stupid raincoats.

658
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,783
You don't understand.

659
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,352
Fashion is cyclical.
This thing could come back.

660
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,182
I think you're out of your mind.

661
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:51,093
I just don't understand
how all those clothes can disappear.

662
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,663
- Moths?
- Moths ate three boxes?

663
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,130
Well, you know what happens
when larvae hatch.

664
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,791
They're everywhere.

665
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,800
You know, I was thinking today.

666
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,668
I never liked
those Seinfelds anyway.

667
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,605
He's an idiot altogether.

668
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,806
- Oh, there's Kramer.
- Hello!

669
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,710
Hello!

670
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,416
Hey.

671
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,955
- Good evening.
- Hope you're hungry.

672
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,351
Paella.

673
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,993
- Here, let me take your coat.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, buddy.

674
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,426
- Hey.
- That shirt.

675
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,257
- Where did you get that shirt?
- What?

676
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,797
That's my cabana shirt.

677
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,957
You stole my shirt,
you son of a bitch!

678
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,899
George, your friends up in the attic,
stealing my clothes!

679
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,836
Give me that back.
Give me that. Give me.

680
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,967
I bought it from Rudy.

681
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,442
Rudy! That skunk!

682
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,047
- I knew he didn't burn those clothes!
- Who's Rudy?

683
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,514
- What clothes?
- I sold your clothes yesterday.

684
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,913
You sold my clothes?

685
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,214
What do you mean,
you sold my clothes?

686
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,086
- I didn't think you wore them anymore.
- It's cruise-wear!

687
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,192
Kramer.

688
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,623
- I love that shirt.
- Oh, yeah.

689
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,662
That's because it's mine!

690
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,824
You look just like Frank...

691
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,401
...on our honeymoon.

692
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,333
Well, thank you.

693
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,235
- Who's this Rudy?
- Rudy's the guy...

694
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,773
...buying Morty's raincoats.

695
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,808
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.

696
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,378
The whole deal's
going down tomorrow.

697
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,175
- Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
- Missing his plane?

698
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,477
- Wasn't that a charter flight?
- Yeah.

699
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,485
What happens to charter tickets
when you don't use them?

700
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,486
Well, I suppose they're wasted.

701
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,818
Yes, I suppose they are.

702
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,927
Tomorrow I'm going straight down
to this Rudy and get my clothes.

703
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,723
- A mouse!
- Egad! A mouse!

704
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,162
In the bedroom!

705
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,941
- You want the tickets?
- Yes.

706
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,081
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

707
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,616
I get a free trip to Paris.
I go in the Big Brothers' Hall of Fame.

708
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,013
I mail my own postcards.

709
00:35:56,187 --> 00:36:00,317
- You know I'm paying for these tickets.
- It's all right. I got lunch.

710
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,158
You should've gone
to the Costanzas' for dinner.

711
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,497
The paella was magnificent.

712
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,362
Have you ever had
really good paella?

713
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,370
- Not really.
- It's an orgiastic feast for the senses...

714
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,408
...a wanton festival of sights,
sounds and colors and...

715
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,446
Dad, you sure we're at
the right carousel?

716
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,605
- This is it.
- So how much are we gonna make?

717
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,616
Take it easy. I've been through
a million of these negotiations.

718
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,083
Two thousand? Three thousand?

719
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,552
That's giving it away.
This is a one-of-a-kind item.

720
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,181
- More? More than 3000?
- Just watch me do my thing.

721
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,355
- Say, Dad, isn't that one of yours?
- Look at this.

722
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,192
Look how this idiot packed it.

723
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,391
He didn't tape it.
He just flipped the flaps.

724
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,196
Wait. Hold it.

725
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,537
Kramer, you missed a couple.

726
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,039
<i>Bonjour, welcome to
the Gateway to Paris charter flight.</i>

727
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,802
Dad, isn't that your charter group?

728
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,738
Honesty. Hard work.

729
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,380
These are the values
that I was raised with.

730
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,074
The most important thing, Joey...

731
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,153
...is to be able to look yourself
in the mirror before you sleep.

732
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,153
Hey, I got news for you, four-eyes...

733
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,157
...there's no way you're staying
with us in Paris.

734
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,758
You burned them?
Those clothes are not yours to burn.

735
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,629
- Who are you, anyways?
- I'm the father.

736
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,397
- He said his father was dead.
- He said I was dead?

737
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,564
That's right.
Squeezed an extra $25 out of me.

738
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,309
That's what my life
is worth to him, $25?

739
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,571
- Hey, Frank!
- Oh, hey.

740
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,648
I want you to know that
I'm retracting our dinner invitation.

741
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,751
You don't have to retract it.
We never went.

742
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,149
I'm retracting that
it was ever offered.

743
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,084
I retract your retraction.

744
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,555
What are you, trying to unload
some junk of yours?

745
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,320
Will you excuse me, please?
We're conducting business here.

746
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,960
Keep them. I'm not interested.

747
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,860
- I thought we had a deal?
- That's another one of my shirts!

748
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,160
Not buying any more clothes
from anyone off the street.

749
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,633
The street?
I'm in the raincoat business 35 years.

750
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:57,240
- Maybe they have moths, like his stuff.
- My clothes don't have moths!

751
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,968
Because of his moths,
you're not buying my raincoats?

752
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,602
- That's right.
- I'm all ticklish.

753
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,679
<i>Flight 433 now boarding
for Miami at gate 18-A.</i>

754
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,520
<i>- Flight 433 now boarding.
- Okay. Let's go.</i>

755
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,662
It was so nice of you to come
to the airport to see us off.

756
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,898
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

757
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,829
- No!
- No!

758
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,229
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

759
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,893
- Take care.
- Okay, Jer.

760
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,164
- Bye-bye, Elaine.
- Bye-bye.

761
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,068
We'll call you when we get home.

762
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,941
Thank you.

763
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,704
I think she meant me, but...

764
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,912
Make sure Kramer uses good tape
to send back the raincoats.

765
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,915
- Okay.
- Bye.

766
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,418
- Bye.
- Aaron?

767
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,488
Aaron, are you okay?

768
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
I could've done more.

769
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,323
I could've done so much more.

770
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,596
- You did enough.
- No.

771
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,629
I could've called the travel agency...

772
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,631
...got them on
another flight to Paris.

773
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,997
- I could've got them out!
- You tried, Aaron.

774
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,038
- It was too expensive.
- This watch.

775
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,436
This watch could've paid
for their whole trip.

776
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,407
This ring.

777
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,173
This ring is one more dinner
I could've taken them out to.

778
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,107
Water.

779
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,583
- They need some water.
- Why?

780
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,619
They'll get dehydrated on the plane!

781
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,087
Get the Seinfelds some water!

782
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,823
Please!

783
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,652
Please!

784
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,299
Hi, Mr. Goldstein. Is Rachel home?

785
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,872
I'm afraid Rachel is not going
to see you tonight...

786
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,736
...or any other night for that matter.

787
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,809
- Why? What did I do?
- You know very well.

788
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,606
I heard about your behavior
at the movies the other night.

789
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,306
It was disgraceful.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

790
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,814
I will not allow
my daughter to be involved...

791
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,511
...with someone of such weak
moral fiber.

792
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,816
Fortunately, my postman happened
to witness the entire incident.

793
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,460
A heavyset fellow. I believe
he lives in your building.

794
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,823
- Now, if you don't mind...
- Rachel.

795
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,588
- Rachel.
- Good night.

796
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,495
So my parents get home,
they open the door...

797
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,832
...my father flicks the light on, and
the whole place is cleaned out.

798
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,065
- Everything.
- Get out.

799
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,300
- How did that happen?
- The broken window.

800
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,241
Klompus never fixed it.
They just walked right in.

801
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,506
Boy, they could use a vacation.

802
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,277
They're taking one. The travel agent's
trying to set something up for them.

803
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,750
So how about that Aaron?

804
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,685
You know what drove me crazy
about him?

805
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,020
Did you ever notice he stood
too close to you when he talked?

806
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,293
No, I hadn't noticed.

807
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,060
Pair of bear claws, please.

808
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,602
- Hi, Newman.
- Hello, Jerry.

809
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,208
<i>I happened to catch you coming out
of Schindler's List the other night.</i>

810
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,367
Oh, were you there?

811
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,510
Yes, I was.

812
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,147
- It's a powerful film.
- Yeah.

813
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,944
- Shocking brutality, don't you think?
- Shocking.

814
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,781
- Yeah, well, that was nothing.
- Jerry! Jerry!

815
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,220
Where the hell is your father?

816
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,868
This is the best thing we ever did.

817
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,300
I hope those exterminators
know what they're doing.

818
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,873
Forget about them.
Let's just try and relax.

819
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,535
Personal distance is
a very important thing.

820
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,906
There's a new personal distance,
ATM distance.

821
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,607
When someone's using an ATM,
you wanna be about 6 feet back.

822
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,719
Don't you? Because people get
edgy around that ATM, don't they?

823
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,084
They got their money out,
their eyes are darting all around.

824
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,418
The other place I wanna be
6 feet away is a urinal.

825
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,686
You want some distance there too.

826
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,729
ATMs and urinals. I guess whenever
someone's taking valuables...

827
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,232
...out of their pants, you wanna give
them as much room as possible.
