1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,004
The thing about birthday parties...

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,467
...is that the first and last party
you have are quite similar.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,177
You just kind of sit there.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,263
You're the least excited person
at the party.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,141
You don't even realize
that there is a party.

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,851
You don't know what's going on.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,729
Both birthday parties,
people have to help you...

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,899
...blow out the candles. You don't
even know why you're doing it.

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,443
What is this ritual?
What is going on?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,531
It's also the only two birthday parties
where other people have to gather...

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,075
...your friends together for you.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,245
Sometimes they're not your friends.
They make the judgment.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,832
They bring them in, and they tell you,
"These are your friends.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,127
Tell them, 'Thank you for coming
to my birthday party. "'

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,175
These are great. Just great.

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,429
Really great. Really, really great.
Don't you think so, Elaine?

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,099
Yeah. Really great.

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,394
A coffee table book
about coffee tables.

19
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,813
How did you come up
with this idea?

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,606
It was there.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,651
Look at this one. It's saying,
"I'm a coffee table.

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,280
Put some coffee on me. The hotter
the better. That's what I'm here for."

23
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,616
You know, actually,
I've got some work I've got to do.

24
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,744
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs...

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,706
...so the book itself
becomes a coffee table?

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,541
That is a great idea.

27
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,293
Really, really great.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,133
And that coffee table is saying,
"Put some coffee on me."

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,553
I'd like to put some coffee on her.
Hot, scalding coffee...

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,015
...right in her face. I swear, this is
like working with a contestant...

31
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,601
<i>...from The Price Is Right.</i>

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,438
Yeah, that's real interesting.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,024
Listen, tell me
if you think this is funny.

34
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,569
"Men definitely hit the remote
more than women.

35
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:55,741
Men don't care what's on TV.
Men only care what else is on TV.

36
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,869
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel...

37
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,746
...because men hunt
and women nest."

38
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,664
Yeah, it's funny. I don't know.

39
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,001
You don't know?
Come on, that's gold.

40
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:10,172
- Well, I don't know about gold.
- Oh, that's gold, baby.

41
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:15,177
- "Baby"? Are you doing George now?
- I was saying " baby" before George.

42
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,429
Don't ask me
any more questions...

43
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,932
...about jokes.
It puts pressure on me.

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,850
Leonard Christian's gonna be there.

45
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,227
Yeah? Who's he?

46
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,855
<i>A writer from Entertainment Weekly.
I would like to have a good show.</i>

47
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,526
<i>- Danke schön, my little dumplings.
- Hi.</i>

48
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,945
- Hey, how about that Toby?
- Yeah, how about her?

49
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,490
She's a package full of energy.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,952
- She's a package full of something.
- And that something is life.

51
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,330
You got to meet her.
She's brimming with positivity.

52
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,458
- Oh, please.
- Hey.

53
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,460
- Are you performing tomorrow?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,962
Great. I'm gonna bring Toby.

55
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,797
You better laugh.
I'm being reviewed.

56
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,633
- Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
- She's a great laugher.

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,553
Yeah. She's a great laugher, Jerry.

58
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,514
"Really, really great."

59
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,225
Want to sit with George?
He's coming with Robin.

60
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,853
- Is that the waitress from the club?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,981
- Is she bringing her kid too?
- She's got a kid?

62
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
You should see George
get along with this kid.

63
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,612
What are you doing under there?
Stop that.

64
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,489
Don't eat that. That's not food.

65
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,410
- He's sucking down Equal packets.
- Do you think 25 kids is too much?

66
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,246
Twenty-five kids
for his birthday party?

67
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,500
Don't put your tongue on the floor.
He's putting his tongue on the floor.

68
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,587
Here, here.
Have some more sugar packets.

69
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,422
So, what about entertainment?

70
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,008
- Should I get Barney?
- No Barney.

71
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,760
- Maybe a clown.
- How about Bozo?

72
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,721
Who's Bozo?

73
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,266
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown.
That's who Bozo is.

74
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,352
When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown
was the clown, bar none.

75
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,354
- George.
- With the orange hair...

76
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,024
- ...the big clown shirt with the ruffles.
- George.

77
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,902
- A TV show, he had cartoons.
- George!

78
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,863
Forget Bozo, George.
Bozo's out.

79
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,949
He's finished. It's over for Bozo.

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,161
When I was a kid,
we didn't have these parties...

81
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,622
...with catered food
and entertainment.

82
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,624
I remember
my seventh birthday party.

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,751
Blow out the candles!
Blow out the candles!

84
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,753
I said blow out the damn candles!

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,965
- Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
- Blow out the candles!

86
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,637
Well, this time,
you can blow out the candles.

87
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,224
No, I have asthma. Ben. Ben!

88
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,145
Hi.

89
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,898
- Hi, Toby.
- How are you doing today?

90
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,484
Fine.

91
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,491
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm great. Just great.

92
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,909
Really great.

93
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,664
- Hey, did you hear about Bob Rosen?
- No.

94
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,750
He's going to Knopf.
He's going to be a vice president.

95
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,168
Knopf? Really?

96
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,713
Boy, that means there's
an opening here for...

97
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,300
...senior editor.
Has Lippman hired anyone?

98
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,178
No. I hear he wants
to promote someone in-house.

99
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,015
- Really?
- Maybe it'll be you.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,435
- Well-
- You really deserve it.

101
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,313
- Well-
- I mean, you have experience...

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,441
...seniority, Lippman really respects
your opinion.

103
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,069
Well...

104
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,156
- Hey, it could be you.
- No.

105
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,201
- No, really.
- Really? You think so?

106
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,788
- Sure.
- Boy, wouldn't that be exciting?

107
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:35,502
- Stranger things have happened.
- Me, a senior editor. I'd like that.

108
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,629
You shouldn't get your hopes up.

109
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,883
Well, it's a possibility.
Like you said...

110
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,304
...stranger things have happened.
Thank you, Elaine. Thank you.

111
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,561
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey.

112
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,479
Can I have a club soda?

113
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,898
- Going on tonight?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,274
- You?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,526
- You know, Leonard Christian's here.
- I know.

116
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,530
Can I ask you something?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,743
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

118
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,745
Take a look.
Do they seem a little bigger?

119
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,371
I don't know. I don't know.

120
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,874
Is it possible for nostrils to expand?

121
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,585
- Is this a bit?
- Hey, I don't do bits.

122
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,754
I'm a prop comic.

123
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,591
Damn it. I can't find my water gun.
I can't go on without my water gun.

124
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,510
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey.

125
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,222
- Well, here's Toby. Jerry.
- This is so exciting.

126
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,099
Look. I have goose bumps. Touch.

127
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,684
Touch them.

128
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,104
- Hey.
- I've never been...

129
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,899
- ...to a comedy club before.
- Really?

130
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,777
Many restaurants are serving
brewed decaf now too.

131
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,032
- You are so funny.
- You'll have a good time, I swear.

132
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,328
He swears, like he thinks
I don't believe him. I believe you.

133
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,413
- He's so funny.
- What about me?

134
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,123
What about you?

135
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,585
I'm only kidding. You're funny too.

136
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,962
I love to laugh.

137
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,047
- Good.
- So you up next?

138
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,132
Yeah. Why don't you guys
get a good table.

139
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,468
We don't want some jerk
sitting in front of us.

140
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,762
It'll be like, " Hey, big-head,
can you move?

141
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,890
I didn't pay a cover charge
to stare at your bald spot."

142
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,977
- So you have a good show.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,397
Have a great show. Hey, we'll
make sure it's a great show.

144
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,732
- Okay. Good. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,946
He's so great. This is so great.
I'm so excited.

146
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,117
Men definitely hit the remote button
more than women.

147
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,246
- Really, really. That is so true.
- Yes, I- Yeah.

148
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,748
Men don't care what's on TV.

149
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,251
Men only care what else is on TV.

150
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,504
Yes. Right on, right on.

151
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,257
See, women-

152
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:49,011
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel.

153
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,139
That is so true. Yes, yes.

154
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,350
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

155
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,817
Yeah, anyway- Yeah, all right.

156
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,029
So anyway...
What was I talking about?

157
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,785
- Hey.
- Hey. What's the deal?

158
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,830
I invite you down here,
I have an important show...

159
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,500
- ...and she heckles me?
- She didn't mean anything.

160
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,587
- What's the matter? Is she crazy?
- She's just enthusiastic, that's all.

161
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,548
- Hey, what is wrong with you?
- Me?

162
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,551
- Nothing's wrong with me.
- You boo me?

163
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,222
You hiss? You didn't stop blathering
throughout the whole set.

164
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,558
Come on. I thought you're a pro.
That's part of the show.

165
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,061
No. Not part of the show.

166
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,396
Booing and hissing
are not part of the show.

167
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,067
You boo puppets.
You hiss villains in silent movies.

168
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,402
That's the way I express myself.

169
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,696
How will you make it
if you can't take it?

170
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,908
- I can take it.
- Let's go.

171
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,786
Hey, man, good set.

172
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,753
- Bozo?
- No.

173
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,256
- B-O-Z-O.
- Sorry. I-

174
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,425
You've never heard
of Bozo the Clown?

175
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,927
No.

176
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,556
- How could you not know?
- I don't know. I just don't.

177
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,226
How can you call yourself a clown
and not know who Bozo is?

178
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:24,231
Hey, what are you hassling me for?
This is just a gig. It's not my life.

179
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,275
I don't know who Bozo is.
Is he a clown?

180
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,110
What, are you kidding me?

181
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,279
- Well, what is he?
- Yes, he's a clown.

182
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,699
All right. So, what's the big deal?
There's millions of clowns.

183
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,619
- All right, just forget it.
- Forget-? Me? You should forget it.

184
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,998
You're living in the past, man.
You're hung up on some clown...

185
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,792
- ...from the '60s, man.
- All right.

186
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,546
Very good, very good. All right,
go fold your balloon animals, Eric.

187
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,091
Eric. What kind of name
is that for a clown, huh?

188
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,845
Excuse me. You must be George.

189
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,557
I'm Robin's mother.
You seem like...

190
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:03,520
- ...such a lovely young man.
- Well, I do what I can.

191
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,314
Hi, Ma. How's everything?

192
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,651
This is just a wonderful party.

193
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,695
The burgers should be ready
in a minute.

194
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,614
Great, great.

195
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,992
What's that smell?

196
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,369
Smoke?

197
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,205
Smoke.

198
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,125
Everybody, I think I smell
some smoke back here.

199
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,836
Fire! Get out of here!

200
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,838
Get out of my way!

201
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,762
- It was an inferno in there!
- There he is. That's him!

202
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,433
- That's the coward that left us to die.
- Let go.

203
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,695
I was trying to lead the way.

204
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:58,158
We needed a leader,
someone to lead the way to safety.

205
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,453
But you yelled, "Get out of my way."

206
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,747
Because...

207
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,374
Because...

208
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,252
...as the leader, if I die...

209
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,547
...then all hope is lost.

210
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,299
Who would lead? The clown?

211
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,512
Instead of castigating me,
you should be thanking me.

212
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,057
What kind of topsy-turvy world
do we live in where heroes...

213
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,477
...are cast as villains,
brave men as cowards?

214
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,063
But I saw you push the women
and children...

215
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,274
...out of the way in a mad panic.

216
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,151
I saw you knock them down.

217
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,780
And when you ran out,
you left everyone behind.

218
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,617
Seemingly. Seemingly.
To the untrained eye...

219
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,495
...I can fully understand
how you got that impression.

220
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,917
What looked like pushing,
what looked like knocking down...

221
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,879
...was a safety precaution.
In a fire...

222
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,340
...you stay close to the ground.
Am I right? Well-

223
00:11:55,507 --> 00:12:00,304
And when I ran out that door,
I was not leaving anyone behind.

224
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,183
Quite the contrary.
I risked my life...

225
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,269
...making sure that exit was clear.

226
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,898
Any other questions?

227
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,442
How do you live with yourself?

228
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,235
It's not easy.

229
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,908
So she doesn't want
to see me anymore.

230
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,623
Did you knock her over too
or just the kids?

231
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,919
No, her too.

232
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,796
And her mother.

233
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,132
- Really? Her mother?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,511
I may have stepped
on her arm too.

235
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,056
You probably couldn't see
because of the smoke.

236
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,474
Yeah.

237
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,559
But it was somebody's arm.

238
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,772
So you feel "women and children first"
in this day and age...

239
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,107
...is somewhat
of an antiquated notion.

240
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,401
To some degree, yeah.

241
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:01,114
So basically, it's every man, woman,
child and invalid for themselves.

242
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,576
- In a manner of speaking.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,411
- Well, it's honest.
- Yeah.

244
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,249
She should be commending me
for treating everyone like equals.

245
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,877
Perhaps when she's released
from the burn centre...

246
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,963
...she'll see things differently.

247
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,133
Perhaps.

248
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,679
So, what was the fire,
just some greasy hamburgers?

249
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:28,475
Yeah. Eric the clown
put it out with his big shoe.

250
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,984
- By the way, did you see this?
- What's that?

251
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,028
The Leonard Christian
article about my show.

252
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,116
Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled.
I bet you it's because of the article.

253
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,911
He really does a number on you.
"Seinfeld froze like a deer...

254
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,623
...in the headlights in the face
of incessant heckling."

255
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,710
I should've let her have it.
I held back because of Kramer.

256
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,378
Know what you should do?

257
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,214
- Go to her office and heckle her.
- Right.

258
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,135
All the comedians say, "What if I came
to your work and heckled you?"

259
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,513
- Yeah, that'd be something.
- I'm not kidding. You should do it.

260
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,558
Wouldn't that be the ultimate
comedian's revenge?

261
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:13,228
- I've always had a fantasy about that.
- Well, go ahead. Do it.

262
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,564
- Why can't I?
- No reason.

263
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,817
You know what?
I think I'm gonna do that.

264
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,904
She came down to where I work.
I'll go down to where she works.

265
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,949
- This is unprecedented.
- There's no precedent, baby.

266
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,621
What, you're using
my " babies" now?

267
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,003
Hey, nice shoes.
Do you wear sandals to work?

268
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,089
It's nice to walk into a room
and get the aroma of feet.

269
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,133
Real conducive
to the work atmosphere.

270
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm sure your coworkers like it.

271
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,095
"Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office."

272
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,349
"Great idea.
We can check on her bunions."

273
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,727
You know, I have work to do here.
I'm very busy.

274
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,565
Is this disruptive? You find it hard
to work with someone interrupting?

275
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,277
- How'd you like it if I called security?
- Security?

276
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,156
I don't know how you'll make it
in this business if you can't take it.

277
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,699
You got to be tough.

278
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,454
You know- All right. That's it.

279
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,123
- Get out of my way.
- What's going on?

280
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,000
What's happening here? Toby.

281
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,961
Toby!

282
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,631
- My pinkie toe.
- Toby!

283
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,179
What did you go out there
to heckle her for?

284
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,390
Because she came down the club
and heckled me.

285
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,267
I gave her a taste
of her own medicine.

286
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,312
Oh, yeah! You gave her a taste
of medicine, all right.

287
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,983
- I didn't want her to have an accident.
- What accident?

288
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,361
After he heckled Toby,
she ran out of the building...

289
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,780
...and a street sweeper
ran over her foot...

290
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,824
...and severed her pinkie toe.

291
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,119
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah. Then after the ambulance left...

292
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,204
...I found the toe.

293
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:58,500
I put it in a Cracker Jack box with ice
and took off for the hospital.

294
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,295
- You ran?
- No. I jumped on the bus.

295
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,006
I told the driver,
"I got a toe here, buddy. Step on it."

296
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,342
- Holy cow!
- Yeah, yeah.

297
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,263
Then all of a sudden,
this guy pulls out a gun.

298
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,183
Well, I knew any delay's
gonna cost her her pinkie toe...

299
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,352
...so I got up, and I started walking
towards him.

300
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,355
He says, "Where do you think
you're going, Cracker Jack?"

301
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,275
I says, "Well, I got a prize
for you, buddy."

302
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,780
- Knocked him out cold.
- How could you do that?

303
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,034
Then everybody is screaming
because the driver's passed out...

304
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,787
...because of all the commotion.
The bus is out of control.

305
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,750
So I grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...

306
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,711
...get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.

307
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,174
- You're Batman.
- Yeah. I am Batman.

308
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:50,344
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.

309
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,387
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand...

310
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,265
...and I kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?

311
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,268
Then I managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...

312
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,562
...with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.

313
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,649
You kept making all the stops?

314
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,656
Well, people kept ringing the bell!

315
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,329
Well, what about the toe?
What happened to the toe?

316
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,206
Well, I am happy to say...

317
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,960
...the little guy's back in place
at the end of the line.

318
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,382
You did all this for a pinkie toe?

319
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,385
Well, it's a valuable appendage.

320
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:38,600
So Kramer found the toe,
and they reattached it.

321
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,270
- Really?
- Yeah. Poor kid.

322
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,438
- What an ordeal.
- And you know...

323
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,025
...how extremely sensitive she is.
She's gonna need our full support.

324
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,486
- Yeah, right.
- Look who's here.

325
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,613
- Toby.
- Hey, it's Toby.

326
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,616
Hi. How are you?
How are you feeling?

327
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,244
- I'll be okay.
- Are you sure?

328
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,830
- I think so.
- Toby, what can I do?

329
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:03,041
- Can I get you something?
- No, thank you.

330
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,460
Toby, please let us help.
We're family.

331
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,130
Well, I could use a cup of coffee.

332
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,842
- She got the promotion?
- Yep.

333
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,136
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

334
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,264
Because of her pinkie toe,
that's why.

335
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:21,476
Because Lippman felt so sorry for her,
he didn't want to hurt her feelings.

336
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,479
- Too bad.
- Sure, the pinkie toe is cute...

337
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,316
...but I mean, what is it? It's useless.

338
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:32,112
It does nothing. It's got that little nail
that is just impossible to cut.

339
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,989
- Why do we need it?
- That's the one...

340
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,158
...that goes "wee, wee, wee"
all the way home.

341
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,912
- You just shut the-
- Elaine, did you hear the news?

342
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,664
- Toby got promoted.
- Yes, I heard, Kramer.

343
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,043
- I work there, remember?
- You know what she told me?

344
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,171
Her first order of business
is to put my coffee table book...

345
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,757
...into the bookstores
as soon as possible.

346
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,510
- Oh, wonderful.
- Throughout this whole thing...

347
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,847
- ...she always kept smiling.
- Of course. She's deranged.

348
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,728
I went down to the magazine,
pleaded with him to see me again.

349
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,606
He agreed to come down tonight
and write another article.

350
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,192
I heard you went down
to somebody's office...

351
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,277
- ...and heckled them.
- Damn right.

352
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,030
- We've been lap dogs long enough.
- How could you do that?

353
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,823
Everybody's talking about it.

354
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,535
It's about time one of us
drew a line in the sand.

355
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,163
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.

356
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,041
You opened the door for all of us.

357
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,377
I can't wait
until somebody heckles me.

358
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,796
- Well, it won't be long.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,674
- ...please welcome Jerry Seinfeld.
- Got to go.

360
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,136
Robin? Robin.

361
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,932
- George, what is it? I'm working.
- Robin, listen to me.

362
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,226
The most amazing thing
has happened.

363
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,062
Kramer has opened my eyes.

364
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,564
I think I've changed.

365
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,483
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

366
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,569
I mean, Bozo the Clown.

367
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,489
I mean, does he really need
"the Clown" in his title?

368
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,741
As clown. Bozo the Clown.

369
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,287
Are we gonna confuse him with Bozo
the district attorney?

370
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:06,582
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.

371
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,837
You'll see. Things will be different now
if you'll just give me one more chance.

372
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,174
Listen, I got to think about this.

373
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,845
- All right, but I'm serious about this.
- All right. Hand it over, man.

374
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

375
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,268
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

376
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,686
Get out of the way!

377
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,654
- George.
- What?

378
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,867
- This is Ronnie Kaye.
- The prop comic?

379
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,370
Hi. I didn't-

380
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,790
I didn't recognize you.
What, did you-? You get a haircut?

381
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,084
Nostrils.

382
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,629
George?

383
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,964
Could I have a word?

384
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:08,602
I was in a hotel, and the back of a door
in the hotel, they have that fire map.

385
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,522
I'm flattered they think
I'll stand in a burning hotel room...

386
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,190
...memorizing directions.

387
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,319
I'll go left by the stair,
right by the candy machine.

388
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,823
I'd probably get lost, have to go back
to the room, check the map again.

389
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,538
They always tell you, whatever you do
in a hotel fire, do not panic.

390
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,749
Hey, I've got four minutes to live.
I've never panicked in my life.

391
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,584
It's my option.

392
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,462
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.

393
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,048
They saved you
swinging from the shower curtain...

394
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,134
...naked with the ice bucket
on your head. What happened?

395
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,096
Well, I panicked.
That's understandable.
