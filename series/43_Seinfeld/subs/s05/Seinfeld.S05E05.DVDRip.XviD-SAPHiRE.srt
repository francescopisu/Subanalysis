1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,962
At a hospital, the treatment
is to lie in a bed.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,716
Whatever's wrong with
a human being, lie down.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,094
Doctor never says, "Well, your
condition isn't as bad as we thought.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,890
We want you to kind of lean against
a doorjamb for seven to 10 days.

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,892
See how that feels."

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,394
Always a bed. Unless you
go to the emergency room...

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,147
...then it's a chair. You've been shot,
stabbed, run over:

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,732
"Have a seat."

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,029
There's always an interesting cultural,
ethnic mix to the hospital staff.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,989
It's like a local news team in there.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,076
The doctor's the anchorman.
He's got white hair, he's in charge.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,245
The nurse is the feature reporter,
you know.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,249
You listen to her, but it's always,
"And now, back to your doctor."

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,501
The orderlies come in
with food and bedpans.

15
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,878
That's like your sports and weather.

16
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,220
Then the baby's head comes out,
and I'm screaming.

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,514
My brother, who's videotaping,
turns green.

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,808
His eyes roll up in his head,
and he blacks out.

19
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,685
He drops the camera,
the camera breaks.

20
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,688
And then the placenta
comes flying out.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,527
- And then a doctor says-
- Hey, thanks. That's enough.

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:12,531
Will you look at that kid. Sucking
away like there's no tomorrow.

23
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,617
Suck, suck, suck.

24
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,452
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,873
- Look at that, Jerry, look at that.
- Yeah, I looked. I saw it.

26
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,418
- Does this make you uncomfortable?
- No, no.

27
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,086
Uncomfortable? Not at all.

28
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,298
My friend's wife's breasts are out.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,091
Look at him.

30
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,385
- So how long do they do this?
- Year or two.

31
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,721
No break?

32
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,683
- After that comes the weaning.
- After sucking comes weaning?

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,852
- First sucking, then weaning.
- You gotta wean.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,770
- Gotta wean.
- Must wean.

35
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,653
- What about that spot I got, huh?
- Yeah. I saw the spot.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,238
You open the door to the car...

37
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,575
...you walk right into the hospital.
You can't beat that spot.

38
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,454
I am on a roll. Yeah.

39
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,581
I'm just willing these
great parking spots.

40
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,374
George.

41
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,462
Maybe the baby would
like to see the spot.

42
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,673
A positive, uplifting message
to start his life out with, huh?

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,969
You can still get a great spot
in this city if you apply yourself.

44
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,804
Where's Kramer?
Shouldn't he be here?

45
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,349
- Did you give him the room number?
- Yeah, 1397.

46
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,101
1937.

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,313
1937, 1937.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,857
Excuse me. Do you know
where the elevator is?

49
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,986
Yeah, it's right around
the corner there. 1937.

50
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,707
Oh, God!

51
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,585
It's a pig-man.

52
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,547
A pig-man!

53
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,968
So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have
something we wanna ask you.

54
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,887
You gotta look. I pulled
it in perfectly equidistant...

55
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,140
- ...from the car in front and behind.
- Would you shut up, George?

56
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,977
I'm taking a cab home.
I can't take this anymore.

57
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,479
You were saying, Stan.
I'm sorry about this.

58
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,690
Myra and I would like
you and Elaine...

59
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,067
...to be the godparents of Steven.

60
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,654
- Me? A godfather?
- Yes.

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,408
Never go against the family, Elaine.

62
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,244
What?

63
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,581
Hey, I just saw a pig-man.
A pig-man.

64
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,667
He was sleeping, and then
he woke up and he looked at me...

65
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,004
...and he made
this horrible sound, this:

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,050
Kramer, what are you talking about?

67
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,762
I'm talking about a pig-man. I walked
in the wrong room, and there he was.

68
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,683
- A pig-man?
- A pig-man. Half pig, half man.

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,185
That's great, Kramer.

70
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,771
Anyway, tell us what's involved
in being a godparent.

71
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,024
Elaine, never ask me
about my business.

72
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,319
Godfather?

73
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,530
The most important thing
is you help with the bris.

74
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,741
- The bris?
- A bris?

75
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,285
- You mean, circumcision?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,538
I would advise against that.

77
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,957
Kramer, it's a tradition.

78
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,377
So was sacrificing virgins
to appease the gods...

79
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,298
- ...but we don't do that anymore.
- Well, maybe we should.

80
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,383
Hey...

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,178
...why are all those people
milling around my car?

82
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,598
- I don't know.
- Maybe they're admiring your spot.

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,310
- They're looking up.
- Hey, there's a guy up on the roof.

84
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,022
That's the guy I told
where the elevator was.

85
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,277
Oh, God, I hope he doesn't jump-
Oh, my God!

86
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,823
My car!

87
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,743
My car!

88
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,999
A mohel? What the hell is a mohel?

89
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,253
A mohel is the person that
performs a circumcision.

90
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,797
Well, where am I gonna find
a mohel?

91
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,341
Motels, models...

92
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,386
How do you find a mohel?

93
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,264
Finding a mohel's easy.
Any idiot can find a mohel.

94
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,100
I have to hold the baby
while they do it.

95
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,019
That's a tough job.
How would you like that?

96
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,105
Hey, Jerry, you ever seen one?

97
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,358
- Oh, you mean, that wasn't...?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,653
- No, you?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,656
What'd you think?

100
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,994
It had no face, no personality.

101
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,459
It was like a Martian.

102
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,838
- But, hey, you know, that's me.
- Hey.

103
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,215
Well, I got the estimate.

104
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,010
It'll cost more to repair the roof
than the car is worth.

105
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,846
I'm going over and seeing
that hospital administrator today.

106
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,640
Someone is gonna pay for this,
and it's not gonna be me!

107
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,643
- Oh, you're screwed.
- I know.

108
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,815
Swan dives from 20 floors up,
lands right on top.

109
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,401
What, do I got a bull's-eye
up there?

110
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,196
He couldn't move over
two feet, huh?

111
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,200
Land on the sidewalk,
it's city property.

112
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,994
Well, I have to interview a mohel.

113
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,413
How about our little Elaine, huh?

114
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,082
Attended the finest schools
on the eastern seaboard...

115
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,045
...equestrian competitions,
debutante balls. Look at her now.

116
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,839
Interviewing mohels.

117
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,634
Yeah!

118
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,221
- What's the matter?
- You all right?

119
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,016
Don't ever question my instincts,
because my instincts are honed.

120
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,685
- Look at that. Look, look.
- What now?

121
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,688
"Hospital receives grant
to conduct DNA research.

122
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,359
Government funds genetic research
at area hospital. " Yeah, so?

123
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,445
Pig-man, baby, pig-man.

124
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,074
If I have to hear about this pig-man
one more time-

125
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,785
Hey, I'm telling you,
the pig-man is alive.

126
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,372
The government's been experimenting
with pig-men since the '50s.

127
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,958
Just because the hospital's
conducting DNA research...

128
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,252
...doesn't mean they're
creating mutant pig-men.

129
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,422
Jerry, will you wake up to reality?
It's a military thing.

130
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,510
They're probably creating
a whole army of pig warriors.

131
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,933
I'll tell you something.
I wish there were pig-men.

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,145
Get a few pig-men walking around,
suddenly I'm looking a lot better.

133
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,608
If someone wanted to fix me up, they
could say, "At least he's no pig-man."

134
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,570
Believe me, there'd be plenty
of women going for these pig-men.

135
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,198
Whatever the deformity, there's
always some group attracted to it.

136
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,285
"That little tail really turns me on."

137
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,412
That's just about enough.

138
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,248
- This doesn't interest you?
- Oh, no, it's fascinating...

139
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,833
...but could you do me a favour?

140
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,501
Could you tape...

141
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,963
...the rest of the " pig-men and the
women who love them" discussion?

142
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,883
And I'll listen to it
the next time I'm here.

143
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,759
I gotta go find a mohel.

144
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,305
You know, you should call that off,
Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.

145
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:57,686
Perhaps one day when the pig-men
roam free, it will be stopped, Kramer.

146
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,273
Until then, off with their heads.

147
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,987
- Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
- It's a myth.

148
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,031
Besides, it makes sex
more pleasurable.

149
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,367
Yeah. So how does that help me?

150
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,037
- George, you ever see one?
- Yeah, my roommate in college.

151
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,122
Yeah, what'd you think?

152
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,625
I got used to it.

153
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,546
All right, I wanna see the pig-man.
Show me the pig-man.

154
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,341
Don't worry, I'll show you.
And you'll never be the same.

155
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,551
Maybe he's just a guy
with a nose like this:

156
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,222
A lot of people have a nose like this.
They're not necessarily pig-men.

157
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,641
Believe me, Jerry,
somewhere in this hospital...

158
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,352
...the anguished oink of pig-man
cries out for help.

159
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,813
Yeah, well, if I hear
an anguished oink, I'm out of here.

160
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,649
I don't see any pig-men.

161
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,236
I see human, human, human.

162
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,612
- Wait a second.
- What?

163
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,906
Oh, it's George.

164
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,701
The administrator's on the third floor.
I'll meet you at the car.

165
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,205
Wait, George. You got room
in the car for the pig-man, huh?

166
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,582
The pig-man can take the bus.

167
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,086
George, if the pig-man had a car,
he would give you a ride.

168
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,006
How do you know? What if
the pig-man had a two-seater?

169
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,551
Be realistic, George.

170
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,432
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up,
we'll squeeze him in.

171
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,268
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,437
- Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
- Thank you.

173
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,024
It's been a very trying couple of days
around the hospital.

174
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,861
Doctors, patients, everyone...

175
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,072
...just grief-stricken over
this unfortunate occurrence.

176
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,116
Well, I join them in their grief.

177
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:39,454
Horrible thing. Flew right
past the children's wing.

178
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,750
All the sick children in the playroom,
looking out the window...

179
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,295
...just traumatized by the incident.

180
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,090
Apparently they thought he was flying.
You know how children are.

181
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,468
"Oh, look, a man is flying.
A man is flying!"

182
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,013
And then splat.

183
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,724
That's where I come in.

184
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,059
On "splat."

185
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,980
You see, Mrs. Sweedler- Or is it
Hospital Administrator Sweedler?

186
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,525
- Mrs. Sweedler is fine.
- Mrs. Sweedler. Thank you very much.

187
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:13,989
You see, this tragedy
has affected me in a very...

188
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,699
A very personal way.

189
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:19,453
- How is that?
- Yes, well, you see...

190
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,580
...the deceased...

191
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,832
...landed on my car.

192
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:29,713
The splat, as it were, actually
occurred on the roof of my car.

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,258
Now, of course,
I can't help but feel that...

194
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,387
...had it been a convertible, this whole
tragedy might have been averted.

195
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,641
But I've never really been
the kind of guy to buy a convertible...

196
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,102
...what with the baldness
and everything.

197
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,190
Well, I have known bald men
who owned convertibles.

198
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,983
They wore a hat.

199
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,863
Yes, but then everything's all
pulled down, and it's- Anyway.

200
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,283
The damage, unfortunately...

201
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,036
...has marred an otherwise
fine automobile...

202
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,997
...rendering it virtually undrivable.

203
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,458
Yes, well, that is a shame.

204
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,504
Yes. A shame.
That is exactly how I would put it.

205
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:15,133
Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all
due discretion and sensitivity...

206
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,720
...and taking in the whole scope
of the situation...

207
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,306
...I just can't help but think...

208
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,644
...that the hospital is somehow
responsible for compensating...

209
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:31,942
...the other still-living victim of this
horrendous, horrendous tragedy.

210
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,403
- Mr. Costanza.
- Yes.

211
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,156
A man plummeted tragically
to his ultimate demise...

212
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,577
- Yes.
- ...and you greedily, callously...

213
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,954
...want to profit from it?

214
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,373
Well, profit...

215
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,712
I think you'll see from the estimate
that I'm not really profiting that much.

216
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,339
It might be a little high, but...

217
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,385
Get out. Get out now.
Get out of my office!

218
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,015
- Should I just leave-?
- Get out!

219
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,518
This is it.

220
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,612
Wait, excuse me.

221
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,823
What happened to the guy
that was in there before?

222
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,952
- I don't know what you're talking-
- No, you know. He had this:

223
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,288
- He was...
- No.

224
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,123
This doesn't look familiar to you?

225
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,669
- Sir-
- Look, I know what's going on.

226
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,339
The oink, oink.

227
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,633
Yes, if you'll excuse me,
I have some patients-

228
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,134
Listen, you little quack.

229
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,930
There was a half man, half pig in that
room over there. Now, where is he?

230
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,640
- Where is he?!
- Half what?

231
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,684
You know what I mean!
Pork. Sausage.

232
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,229
"That's all, folks."

233
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,816
I think he's been released.

234
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,736
Good.

235
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,322
- He's lying!
- All right, enough of this.

236
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,617
- I gotta go find George.
- All right, you go ahead.

237
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,410
Kramer.

238
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,293
- Where's the mohel?
- He'll be here.

239
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,337
- He's late already.
- Relax.

240
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,173
You'd think you were
getting whacked.

241
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,301
I don't know why he asked me
to be godfather.

242
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,929
We're not close. Because
we're on the softball team...

243
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,266
...I'm pitcher, he's catcher, he thinks
we have a special relationship?

244
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,977
I thought pitchers and catchers
had a special rapport.

245
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,856
Maybe in hardball, with all the signals,
but I'm just lobbing it in.

246
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,232
We don't have conferences.

247
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,943
He doesn't come out to the mound
and encourage me.

248
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,697
What about me? I just watched
a few games with her in the stands.

249
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,992
Don't they have friends? They're
level-jumping on our friendship.

250
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,202
Yes, it is level-jumping.

251
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,710
So...

252
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,336
...you been to a bris before?

253
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,047
No.

254
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,425
I've been to a few of them.

255
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:06,346
If you start to get woozy later,
which is quite common...

256
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,224
...stay close to me.
I'll get you through it.

257
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,019
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.

258
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,023
We're not talking about a manicure.

259
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,275
Imagine, this is gonna
be his first memory...

260
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,570
...of his parents just standing there
while some stranger...

261
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:26,408
...cuts off a piece of his manhood
and then serves a catered lunch.

262
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,911
- Myra?
- She'll be okay.

263
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,039
- Kramer, what's the matter with you?
- Me?

264
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,249
- Oh, that's the mohel.
- He's here.

265
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,919
It's about time.

266
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,337
- Hi.
- Hello.

267
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,214
- Hello, I'm the mohel.
- Oh, hello.

268
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,549
It's very nice to meet you all.

269
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,927
What was that? Jeez,
it scared the hell out of me!

270
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,347
I mean, my God,
I almost had a heart attack!

271
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,058
Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway...

272
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,937
...we're here to perform
the mitzvah of the bris.

273
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,524
Is the baby gonna cry like that?
Is that how he cries...

274
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,402
...with that loud, sustained, squealing
cry? That could pose a problem.

275
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,279
Do have any control over your child?

276
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,366
This would be the time to exercise it,
when baby is crying...

277
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:12,037
...in that high-pitched squealing tone
that can drive you insane!

278
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,417
- Did you find the place all right?
- Did I find it all right?

279
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,461
Could you send me to
a more dangerous area?

280
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,463
I'm dreading walking back
to the subway...

281
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,841
...someone shouldn't smack me
and steal my bag.

282
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,469
Because I'll be lying there, and people
will spit on me and empty my pockets.

283
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:32,140
I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum,
a dog, a mutt, a mongrel, an animal!

284
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,768
God forbid anybody should
help me or call an ambulance.

285
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,063
That's too much trouble, to pick
up a phone and press a few buttons.

286
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,232
What's the point?

287
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,069
Oh, yeah.

288
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,405
Darling, you see where
that glass is?

289
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,156
See how the glass
is near the edge?

290
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,325
You've got the whole table
to put the glass.

291
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:55,414
Why you chose the absolute edge so
half the glass is hanging off the table.

292
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,917
You breathe, and it falls over. Then
you've got broken glass on the carpet.

293
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,547
Embedded in the carpet fibres,
deep in the shag, broken glass.

294
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,841
Bits of broken glass
you can never get up.

295
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,342
Can't get it up with a vacuum.

296
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,678
Even on your knees
with a magnifying glass...

297
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,472
...you'll never get all the pieces.
You think you got it.

298
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,433
Two years later, you're barefoot...

299
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,685
...you step on broken glass
and kill yourself!

300
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,355
Is that what you want? I don't think
that's what you want. Do you?

301
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,155
He's very highly recommended,
so...

302
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,365
You're holding the baby?

303
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,659
- No, no.
- Hello. Who's holding the baby?

304
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,537
- Who's holding the baby?!
- Jerry is. Jerry, do you wanna...?

305
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,164
Yeah. I'm holding the baby.

306
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,792
- Okay, go.
- I'm going. All right, I am. I'm going.

307
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,711
- Don't push me.
- Okay, you sit there.

308
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,922
Now I need the baby.
Bring me the baby.

309
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,216
I need the baby!

310
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,845
- No, I'm not gonna let them.
- What are you doing? Come back!

311
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,809
People, people. Compose yourself.
This is a bris!

312
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,479
We're performing a bris here,
not a burlesque show.

313
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:05,150
This is not a school play. This is not
a baggy-pants farce. This is a bris!

314
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,069
A sacred, ancient ceremony...

315
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,405
...symbolizing the covenant
between God and Abraham.

316
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,491
Or something.

317
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,328
No, don't touch anything.
Don't touch a thing.

318
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,790
I could have been a kosher butcher
like my brother.

319
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,210
The money's good.
It's got a union with benefits.

320
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,003
And cows don't have families.

321
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,257
You make a mistake with a cow,
you move on with your life.

322
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,426
Anyway.

323
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,936
- Hurry up, George. Step on it!
- All right, all right.

324
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,105
That damn mohel!
He circumcised my finger.

325
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,275
- The mohel circumcised my finger.
- You flinched.

326
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,027
Flinched? I did not flinch.
George, did I flinch?

327
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,197
Oh, how would he know?
He blacked out. He fainted.

328
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,116
It was very traumatic.

329
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,369
Last thing I remember was you
flinching. Then everything went black.

330
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,872
Who's got tissues?
I need more tissues.

331
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,957
Look at this thing.
It's my phone finger!

332
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,169
- Careful. You're getting blood all over.
- What about the baby?

333
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,130
The baby's fine. They took him
to the hospital as a precaution.

334
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,007
But look at me.
I'm the one who's hurt!

335
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,968
Will you stop it? You're just
gonna need a few stitches.

336
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,137
A few stitches?
I've never had stitches.

337
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,472
I'll be deformed. I can't live with that.

338
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,516
Goes against my personality.
It's not me.

339
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,145
Hey, look at that.
Boy, are you lucky!

340
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,314
Another great spot
in front of the hospital.

341
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,233
In an emergency yet!
How lucky are you, huh?

342
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,029
Is that unbelievable?
How unbelievable is that, huh?

343
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,448
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.

344
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,870
- I've never seen a mohel like that.
- That was a one-in-a-million mohel.

345
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,497
- I said I'm sorry.
- Look at this.

346
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,626
- You'll be okay. I'll see you later, huh?
- Where is he going?

347
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,754
I'm gonna look for a bathroom.

348
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,091
Well, if it isn't Shaky the Mohel.

349
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,011
Nice circumcision, but it's not
supposed to be a finger.

350
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,972
Circumcision was perfect.
That was your fault. You flinched!

351
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,934
Oh, who made you a mohel? You
get your degree from a matchbook?

352
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,186
You see? He flinched again.

353
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,021
Nice. You picked a hell of a mohel!

354
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,815
One more peep, and I'll slice you
like a smoked sturgeon.

355
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,860
- Oh, don't threaten me, butcher boy.
- Butcher boy?

356
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,654
Yeah, what was this?

357
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,656
What was this?
What was this, huh?

358
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,116
Careful, Jerry,
the mohel's got a knife!

359
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,285
Hey, what's going on out here?

360
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,538
You should be ashamed of yourself,
both of you.

361
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,541
- Blood.
- Oh, how's the baby?

362
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,669
- There's nothing wrong with the baby.
- The circumcision went fine.

363
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,089
Thank God the flincher
didn't harm the baby.

364
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,675
I'll get you for this.
This is my business, my life!

365
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,969
No one ruins it for me, no one!

366
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,762
Here's my card.

367
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,348
Get out of my way!

368
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,112
I can't do it.

369
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,908
Look what they did to my boy.
They massacred my boy.

370
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:05,289
You really do the worst Godfather
I've ever heard. You're not even close.

371
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,750
Oh, that's the flicks.

372
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,878
It's a '76 Chevy Impala.

373
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,714
They stole it right in front
of the hospital.

374
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,925
I saw the guy drive off in it.

375
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:20,721
Well, he's about 5 feet tall...

376
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,723
...hairless...

377
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,225
...pink complexion.

378
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,811
Looks like a pig.

379
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,897
Yeah, all right, thank you.
Thank you.

380
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,149
Yeah.

381
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,278
So any word from the pig-man?

382
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,363
- No.
- No.

383
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,575
And he's not a pig-man, is he?

384
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:46,121
No, he's not. He's just
a fat little mental patient.

385
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,916
Myra. Stan.

386
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,126
- Don't touch him.
- What's the matter?

387
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,421
You're out, Jerry. Out as godfather.
You too, Elaine. You're both out.

388
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,258
- But I didn't do any-
- No buts. We've made up our minds.

389
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:03,055
We want Kramer. He showed us
how much he cares about Steven.

390
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:09,019
Don't ever go against the family,
Jerry.

391
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,652
Godfather.

392
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,321
- Godfather.
- Yes.

393
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,881
To me, what's really amazing, that for
every job that there is in the world...

394
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,925
...there's someone willing to do it.

395
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,845
Someone goes, " I will stand in
the tunnel breathing exhaust...

396
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,848
...watching the cars go by,
making sure everything's okay."

397
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:50,060
Someone goes, " I will work behind
the elephant with the big shovel."

398
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,563
Doctors go, "Yes, I will
confine myself...

399
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,858
...to one particularly objectionable
part of the human body...

400
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,404
...all day, every day. I will do it."

401
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:04,700
I think people that are unemployed
are not really unable to find work...

402
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,743
...they're just easily disgusted.

403
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,038
"Yes, I'm starving, and my family
has no clothing or shelter...

404
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,749
...but I'm not cleaning that up."
