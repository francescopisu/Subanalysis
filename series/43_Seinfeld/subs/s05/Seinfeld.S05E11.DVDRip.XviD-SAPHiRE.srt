1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,796
Doctor is a prestigious occupation...

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,867
...but it's one of the only jobs...

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,009
...where you have to have your
diploma right up there on the wall.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,235
It makes them seem
so insecure, doesn't it?

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,142
"I really am a doctor, you know.

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,510
If you think I'm not,
just check it out."

7
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,878
I don't know why they need
these little bits...

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,682
...of psychological
leverage over us.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,417
"Go in that room, take your pants off,
wait 15 minutes...

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,255
...then I'll give you my opinion."

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,794
After that, anybody with pants on...

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,229
...seems like they know
what they're talking about.

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,360
In any difference of opinion,
pants always beats no pants.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,502
Can I say one word to you?

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,169
Lobster.

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,179
The lobster here is unbelievable.

17
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,651
A little expensive.

18
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,056
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Yes, well, you know...

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,419
...I'm not thinking about the price.

20
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,824
You know, you're the only woman
I've never thought about the price.

21
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,658
Get the lobster. I beg you to get it.

22
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,357
- Go for it. Go for the lobster.
- George...

23
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,162
George...

24
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,463
...I think we have to talk.

25
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,539
I think we have a problem.

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,740
We do?

27
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,745
We can't keep seeing each other.

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,407
Why?

29
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,077
Because it's over.

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,111
It's my parents, George.

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,850
The differences in our religion...

32
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,053
George...

33
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,993
...can you ever forgive me?

34
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,961
Have you decided yet?

35
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,630
Yes. I'll have the lobster.

36
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,704
You know, I'm starting to think that
maybe lobster isn't the way to go.

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,215
- What? He asked you out?
- We started to talk, I told him I jog...

38
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,514
- ...and he put his hand on my heart.
- On your heart?

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,123
- Jerry, the man is a doctor.
- Doctor. He's a podiatrist.

40
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,783
So? Same thing.

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,261
Anyone can get into podiatry school.
George got into podiatry school.

42
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,295
- Really?
- Sure.

43
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,961
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

44
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,067
- Are you gonna be stopping by later?
- Yes, I'll be stopping.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,073
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- See you later.

46
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,908
Well, we can't all be
dating podiatrists.

47
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,318
- It's over.
- What?

48
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,922
- How'd you get in?
- Kramer.

49
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,559
- What's that?
- Lobster.

50
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,993
Looks like a swan.

51
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,557
- She says we can't go out anymore.
- Why?

52
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,169
Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox.

53
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,938
Her parents won't let her date
anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox!

54
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,710
Latvian Orthodox?

55
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,641
It is lobster.

56
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,611
She's limiting herself
to Latvian Orthodox?

57
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,217
- That's too bad.
- I know.

58
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,217
This was the only woman
I never lied to.

59
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,550
Well, that's not entirely true.

60
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,282
Oh, whatever.

61
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,021
- This is delicious.
- Succulent.

62
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,793
She knew I didn't have a job.
She knew I lived at home.

63
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,095
Didn't seem to bother her.

64
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,534
I think I could have married
this woman.

65
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,570
Why don't you just ask her parents?

66
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,903
I can't. I met them. They're devout.

67
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,479
You know, in the cab
on the way over here, I...

68
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,310
I actually thought about converting.

69
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,918
- To Latvian Orthodox?
- Why not? What do I care?

70
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,787
You know, it's not like
changing toothpaste.

71
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,291
I think it would be romantic.

72
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,623
- Really?
- Yeah. It's like Edward VIII...

73
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,531
...abdicating the throne
to marry Mrs. Simpson.

74
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,233
Like King Edward.

75
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,872
- Like King Edward, Jerry.
- Yeah, well...

76
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,105
...King Edward didn't live in Queens
with Frank and Estelle Costanza.

77
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,181
You know what?
I could probably do this.

78
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,014
- What's the difference?
- George, I was just kidding around.

79
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,554
I wouldn't even tell her.
I could surprise her.

80
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,921
- George, I wasn't serious.
- How hard could it be?

81
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,461
You make a little contribution,
you have a ceremony.

82
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,259
I am gonna think about this.

83
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,596
I am really gonna think about this.

84
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,106
- I guess this one is my fault.
- Oh, yeah.

85
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,416
That was nice. Have you always
been such a good kisser?

86
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,879
I don't know. Not always.

87
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,386
No?

88
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,389
No, I... I had to work at it.

89
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,357
As a kid, while kids were out playing,
I'd be in my room practicing kissing.

90
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,093
It was worth it.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,228
I'll be right back.

92
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,673
- Where are you going?
- To wash my hands.

93
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,607
- They're sticky from the orange.
- Meet you back here?

94
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,975
- Right there.
- Okay.

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,038
<i>Fungicide?</i>

96
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,300
<i>Fungus?</i>

97
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,306
Fungicide.

98
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,474
- I mean, what could she have?
- I don't know.

99
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,948
- Fungus.
- Exactly.

100
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,151
- So, what'd you say?
- I said I was coming down...

101
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,348
...with the flu and I had to go home.

102
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,993
What were you doing
opening her medicine cabinet?

103
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:07,030
I didn't open it. It was open.
I just nudged it a little.

104
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,993
- You were snooping.
- I was not snooping.

105
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,069
I did not break the seal.
There was no breaking and entering.

106
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,298
- I wouldn't do that.
- I would.

107
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,640
I always open medicine cabinets.

108
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,879
Well, I trust people not to do that.

109
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,743
Big mistake.

110
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,587
Why don't you ask
that doctor what it is.

111
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,815
Now he's a doctor?
Before he was a podiatrist.

112
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,516
But that's what podiatrists do.
They deal in fungus.

113
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,256
They're knee-deep in fungus.
This guy knows fungus.

114
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,499
I am not going to ask him
about funguses.

115
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,393
Fungi.

116
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,233
- What?
- Fungi.

117
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:59,009
Why do you want to accept
the Latvian Orthodox faith?

118
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,687
In this age of uncertainty
and confusion...

119
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,393
...a man begins to ask himself
certain questions.

120
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,498
How can one even begin
to put into words something so...

121
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,668
Enigmatic?

122
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,935
- Vast?
- No, not vast.

123
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,372
Well, whatever it is,
basically you like the religion.

124
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,239
- Yes.
- Is there one aspect of the faith...

125
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,713
...you find particularly attractive?

126
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,045
I think the hats.

127
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,825
The hat conveys that solemn
religious look you want in a faith.

128
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,489
Very pious.

129
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,660
Are you familiar
with Orthodox theology?

130
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:55,800
Well, perhaps not to the extent
that you are, but...

131
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,973
But I know the basic plot, yeah.

132
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,742
- Plot?
- Yes, you know, the flood...

133
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,351
...and the lepers
and the commandments and all that.

134
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,784
Well, it's obvious
you are sincere in your desire.

135
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,990
Oh, yes, I am, Father.
Incredibly sincere.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,684
So...

137
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,523
...am I in?

138
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,692
The first step would be
to familiarize yourself...

139
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,702
...with these texts.

140
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,172
You see, Father, I'm incredibly
anxious to become a member.

141
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,042
Don't you offer any kind
of an express conversion?

142
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,944
A quick change?

143
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,509
Yes?

144
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh, I'm sorry. Father, there's a man
waiting in the chapel.

145
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,351
Well, you may attend to it, Sister.

146
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,495
This is George Costanza.
He is interested in joining the Church.

147
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,230
Are you? Well, that's wonderful.

148
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,595
- Well, good luck to you.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,939
Nice nun.

150
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,107
No, no. Sister Roberta is not a nun.

151
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,904
She is what we call a novice.

152
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,207
She won't be taking her final vows
until next Thursday.

153
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,209
May I help you?

154
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,878
Yeah. I'm here to pick up my friend,
George Costanza.

155
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,483
- Well, he's in with the Father.
- Oh, yeah.

156
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,756
- I'm Sister Roberta.
- Oh, Kramer, yeah. It's a pleasure.

157
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,892
Mine.

158
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,335
I can't believe how easy it is.
I'm virtually Orthodox.

159
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,668
All I have to do is read a few books,
memorize a few prayers...

160
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,433
...and I'm in the club.

161
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,340
- That's all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it.

162
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,347
By Christmas Day,
I will be Brother Costanza.

163
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:49,077
And what is Brother Costanza
planning on telling Mother Costanza?

164
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,286
Brother Costanza will be taking
the vow of silence.

165
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,163
- Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,228
Oh, a Slinky.

167
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,696
- Sister Roberta gave it to me.
- Why'd she give you that?

168
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,338
Well, I think she liked me.

169
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,439
- What do you mean, she liked you?
- Liked me.

170
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,644
Kramer, they like everybody.
They're friendly people.

171
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,550
I think I picked up on a vibe.

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,351
- You picked up on a vibe from a nun.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,192
Jerry, I'm telling you,
I have this power...

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,658
...and I have no control over it.

175
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,391
Yeah. All right.

176
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,660
That's my phone.

177
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,597
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

178
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,261
Just wanted to stop by and see
how you were feeling.

179
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,304
A little better.

180
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,805
Okay. If you need anything,
let me know.

181
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,310
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

182
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,005
- Bye.
- Bye.

183
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,816
Story.

184
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,986
She's subletting Carol's place
for a month.

185
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,885
- Yeah. She likes you.
- Yeah. But there's a problem.

186
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,028
I found a tube of a fungicide
in her medicine cabinet.

187
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,524
- So?
- So I don't know why she's using it.

188
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,895
How do you even know it's hers?
Maybe it belonged to Carol.

189
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,264
- Did you see a name on the tube?
- I didn't look.

190
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,236
Well, take a look.
It might not even belong to her.

191
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,569
People always leave things
in medicine cabinets.

192
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,540
I got this old bottle
of cough medicine.

193
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,506
I still have Brylcreem.

194
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

195
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,755
- Could I use your bathroom?
- My bathroom?

196
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,457
- You sure you don't mind?
- Oh, of course not.

197
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,035
People ask me medical questions
all the time.

198
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,002
Well, I mean, the question
isn't even for me, actually.

199
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,472
- It's for a friend.
- Elaine, I'm used to it.

200
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,501
- I'm a doctor.
- Well...

201
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,907
...podiatrist.

202
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,086
No, no. I'm just saying, you didn't
really go to medical school.

203
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,745
You went to podiatry school...

204
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,758
...which I'm sure is very grueling
in its own way.

205
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,557
I went to podiatry school
because I like feet.

206
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,530
I chose to work with feet.

207
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:21,038
- I like feet too. I'm just saying-
- Saying what?

208
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,008
- How you doing in there?
- Fine. All done.

209
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,273
- Just looking for the soap.
- No soap?

210
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,576
No, I don't see it.

211
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,543
Here you go.

212
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,085
George?
What are you doing in there?

213
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,386
What? Nothing.

214
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,554
- You've been in there an hour.
- You don't feel well?

215
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,063
- I'm fine.
- I want to know...

216
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,032
- ...what you're doing in there.
- Nothing.

217
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,137
- George, open the door.
- No.

218
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,102
- Georgie.
- No!

219
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,135
- Hey.
- Good evening.

220
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,779
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

221
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,916
...but I found another toy
I thought you might like.

222
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,186
Okay. Latvius was the son
of which apostle?

223
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,919
And I'll need that
in the form of a question.

224
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,428
I don't know. I can't believe
they're making me take this test.

225
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,773
- Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
- No.

226
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,944
All right, the next time you see him,
show him this.

227
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,443
- You took her medicine.
- Well, not on purpose. I was-

228
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,481
I was hoping there'd be
a name on the tube.

229
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,951
- When are you seeing him again?
- I don't know. We got into this thing...

230
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,852
...about how podiatrists
aren't real doctors.

231
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,287
How could you say that?

232
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,927
That's your fault.
You just got me thinking.

233
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,894
I was merely speaking
extemporaneously.

234
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,399
I've got nothing against the foot.
I'm pro-foot.

235
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,128
Me too.

236
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,105
- Do you think I should apologize?
- Yes. He's a doctor.

237
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,605
Wait a second.

238
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,349
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

239
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,641
"Matthew. Luke.

240
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,785
Paul."

241
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,023
What, you're cheating
on your conversion test?

242
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,688
- I told you.
- What?

243
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,454
- I told you she liked me.
- Who?

244
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,120
- Sister Roberta.
- How do you know?

245
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,391
She told me.
She said she's never had a man...

246
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,660
...stir up all these feelings
inside of her.

247
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,896
She's questioning her faith.
She's thinking of leaving the Church.

248
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,969
All this power!

249
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,804
Look what I'm doing.
I'm dangerous, Jerry.

250
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,505
I'm very, very dangerous!

251
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,050
I must say, George,
I was somewhat surprised...

252
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,661
...at the results
of your conversion test.

253
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:03,128
I don't recall having seen
such an impressive performance.

254
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:08,097
You truly must be filled
with the spirit of the Lord.

255
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,499
Oh, I'm full of it, Father.

256
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,773
Yes? Yes?

257
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,212
Yes, yes, I see.

258
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,547
I'm sorry. Something has come up.

259
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,046
Oh, sure. I understand.

260
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,183
- Hey.
- Yeah.

261
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,163
- You wanted to see me, Father?
- Yes.

262
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,766
Please sit down.

263
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,261
Sister Roberta came
to see me yesterday-

264
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,430
I know what this is about, Father.
I didn't do anything.

265
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,338
I just spoke to her innocently
for just a few minutes.

266
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,375
It's just that I...

267
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,309
I have this power.

268
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,241
Yes.

269
00:15:55,087 --> 00:16:00,525
It is a Latvian word which means
"the lure of the animal."

270
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,220
I don't understand.

271
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,727
Women are drawn to you.

272
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,163
They would give anything
to be possessed by you.

273
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,735
Help me, Father. Help me!

274
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,428
Yes, yes. I will help you.

275
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,800
Now, listen very carefully.

276
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,876
I want you to buy
10 cloves of garlic...

277
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,639
...three quarts of vinegar...

278
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,282
...6 ounces...

279
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,382
What is that stench? I got it.

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,551
- Hey.
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

281
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,289
<i>- It stinks. What are you doing?
- I've got the kavorca.</i>

282
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,457
<i>- The kavorca? What is that?
- The lure of the animal.</i>

283
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,194
- I'm dangerous.
- What is this thing around your neck?

284
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,704
The priests, they're helping me.
I just bathed in vinegar.

285
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,335
You know, you're funkifying
the whole building.

286
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,445
Keep away, Jerry. Just keep away.

287
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,549
Kramer! Kramer!

288
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,586
George Costanza?

289
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,018
Estelle's son?

290
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,516
Latvian Orthodox?

291
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,991
- Why are you doing this?
- For a woman.

292
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,187
A woman?
What, are you out of your mind?

293
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,663
Why can't you do anything
like a normal person?

294
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:20,066
Wait. Is this the group that goes
around mutilating squirrels?

295
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,397
No, it's a regular religion.

296
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,544
I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be
too late to get out of this.

297
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,805
- I don't want to get out of it!
- But, George...

298
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,610
...you don't know what you're saying.
You're under their control.

299
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,447
- What, they brainwashed you?
- No. No.

300
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,522
You're not performing any rituals
in this house!

301
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,056
Go back to the psychiatrist.
I beg you.

302
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,854
And stay away from those squirrels.

303
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,666
- Oh, hi.
- How you doing, Jerry?

304
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,961
- Good. What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

305
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,265
I hardly slept last night
with all the scratching.

306
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,566
Bonkers was going crazy.

307
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,408
- Bonkers?
- My cat.

308
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,173
He's got this weird
sort of skin condition.

309
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,816
It's some type of fungus.
I couldn't find his medicine.

310
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,010
- Oh, it's your cat!
- What?

311
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,220
Nothing.

312
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,721
- Are you ready, my son?
- Yes, "faddah."

313
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,059
- What did you say?
- What?

314
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,995
I thought you said "faddah."

315
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,135
I said "faddah. " I...

316
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,139
I meant "Father."
Just a little bit nervous.

317
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,803
Of course.

318
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,382
How you doing?

319
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,547
Get away from me, you creep.

320
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,023
Yes. Yes, it worked!

321
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,186
Sister Roberta.
I still got time to catch her.

322
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,643
I gotta get there.

323
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,422
Congratulations, George.

324
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,801
Welcome to the faith.

325
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,099
Sister Roberta, would you please
offer the final benediction?

326
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,341
I can't.

327
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,539
I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful religion...

328
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,240
...but I am not worthy of it.

329
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,842
I've found something else.

330
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,825
Him.

331
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,968
You know, because I love the foot.
I'm a big fan of the foot.

332
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,164
Well, it's my fault.
I got a little defensive.

333
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,435
And that pinkie toe. Come on!

334
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,409
How adorable is the pinkie toe?

335
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,946
It's my favorite toe.

336
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,481
Let's face it. You get a bunion,
where you going?

337
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,883
- You're not going to the ear guy.
- No, you're not.

338
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,463
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

339
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,493
- Where's the bathroom?
- It's right down here to the left.

340
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,202
I will meet you right back here?

341
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,839
Elaine, it's her cat.
Her cat has the fungus.

342
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,375
So I need the tube back.

343
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,306
<i>Fungicide?</i>

344
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,313
<i>Fungus?</i>

345
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,421
Something's wrong.
I don't feel the same lure.

346
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,793
You don't?

347
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,258
What have I-?

348
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,364
I must return to the Church.

349
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,591
By the way, you really need
to take a bath. You stink.

350
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,101
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

351
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,035
Once you put medicine
in your cabinet...

352
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,176
...you're never using it again.
Medicine you use is on the sink.

353
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:22,040
It's not really a medicine cabinet.
It's really like an ointment museum.

354
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,081
It's like, "Here's a salve from 1983...

355
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,742
...some cream from the '70s."
But you want to keep it private.

356
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,889
A medicine cabinet is a place
that reveals our weaknesses...

357
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,049
...and can throw off the balance
between people that are going out.

358
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,695
Somebody peeks in there,
"Oh, I see Mr. Perfect needs...

359
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,956
...tough actin' Tinactin.

360
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,730
Well, I guess I'll be calling the shots
in this relationship from now on."

361
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,312
- You did that for me?
- Well, I didn't do it for my mother.

362
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,320
- I'm really flattered.
- Yeah.

363
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,822
But I just don't feel ready
to make a commitment yet.

364
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,926
Maybe when I get back from Latvia.

365
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,524
Latvia?

366
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,864
Yes. I'm going to stay
with some relatives there for a year.

367
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,834
Isn't it great?

368
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,636
Enjoy. Enjoy.

369
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,777
Oh, George. You are so sweet.

370
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,311
Don't ever change.

371
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,117
I'd like a doggy bag for this, please.
