1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,628
Aren't mannequins kind of an insult
to your imagination?

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,630
You couldn't visualize a sweater...

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,503
...so we'll show you on this
life-size, snotty puppet.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,009
When they're finished
they become crash-test dummies.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,908
The end of the line
for a mannequin.

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,747
"Whatever happened to Bob?"

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,077
"Have you seen that
new Volvo commercial?

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,350
He's got a bull's -eye
right in his face."

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,988
Mannequins are only used
for car accidents and fashion...

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,628
...two situations that it's impossible
for us to imagine ourselves:

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,627
Well-dressed or getting killed.

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,066
I'm sure some
pro-mannequin organization...

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,963
...doesn't like
the term " mannequin."

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,799
"Hey, they're not mannequins.
They're the life-deprived."

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,202
- That was really good.
- Yeah. Are you full?

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,439
Oh, no. I've had just enough.

17
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,244
Ah, here we go. Apple pie.

18
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,411
Best apple pie in the city.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,493
Delicious.

20
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,491
I'm not waiting for you.

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,164
Take some.

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,727
- No, thanks.
- You're not gonna have any?

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,097
- No.
- Do you not like apple pie?

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,766
- No. It's not that.
- Well, at least taste it.

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,169
No.

26
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,811
- You won't even taste it?
- No.

27
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,915
Come on, try it.

28
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,775
A little taste.

29
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,888
Come on.

30
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,916
She wouldn't so much as taste it.

31
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,554
- Did she say why?
- No.

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,925
She just kept shaking
her head like this:

33
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,232
- Maybe she's diabetic.
- No.

34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,633
She carries Entenmanns doughnuts
in her purse.

35
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,603
Maybe you said something
that offended her.

36
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,437
I told her we should have moving
walkways all over city.

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,847
- Like at the airport?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,449
- That's a great idea.
- Tell me about it.

39
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,587
- We could be zipping everywhere.
- They could at least try it.

40
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,551
- They never try.
- What's the harm?

41
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,122
No harm!

42
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,659
I'm sorry. There's no reason
for her not to taste that pie.

43
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,489
- Who wouldn't taste the pie?
- Audrey.

44
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,255
Dump her.

45
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,864
I never broke up with anyone
for not tasting pie.

46
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,530
I once broke up with someone
for not offering me pie.

47
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,940
- You did?
- He could be eating a hero...

48
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,702
...he wouldn't offer me anything.
It's a sickness.

49
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,436
Well, I can't walk anywhere now.

50
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,276
I'm just gonna be wishing
there were walkways.

51
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,518
- What are you doing?
- I got a pebble.

52
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,551
I never heard of that
happening to a woman.

53
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,386
What the hell does that mean?

54
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,285
Hey. Oh, hey, Elaine.

55
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,052
- What?
- Go like this:

56
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,890
- What? Why?
- Do it, do it.

57
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,190
- Like this:
- Like...

58
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,331
- ...like this?
- Oh, yeah!

59
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,936
It's you!

60
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,666
- What's me?
- There's a clothing store downtown.

61
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,708
They got a mannequin in there
that looks exactly like Elaine.

62
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,742
- Get out!
- It's uncanny!

63
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,178
It's like they chopped off your arms
and legs, dipped you in plastic...

64
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,318
...screwed you all back together,
and stuck you on a pedestal.

65
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,714
It's really quite exquisite.

66
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,684
- What's the name of the store?
- Rinitze.

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,384
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,524
May I help you?

69
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,234
It's this itch. I was watching TV
without my shirt on...

70
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,064
...and my couch cushion
didn't have any fabric on it.

71
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,838
Wait a minute. Rinitze. Don't they
have some really cool suits in there?

72
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,566
Real boss.

73
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,711
- I'm going down there.
- I'll go with you.

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,007
I gotta get a new suit. I got a second
interview with MacKenzie.

75
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,549
I think I'm really close.
They're taking me to lunch on Friday.

76
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,946
- Aren't you gonna need this?
- Keep it.

77
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,255
It looks exactly like me.

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,190
It's like some pod landed from
another planet and took your body.

79
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,633
Don't fall asleep, Elaine.

80
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,634
What's going on?
How do you think this happened?

81
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,777
Whoa, look at this.

82
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,839
This is a beautiful suit, huh?

83
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,713
You think that could be a coincidence,
George? Is that possible?

84
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,284
You are perfect for that suit.

85
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,118
You think so?

86
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,786
Excuse me.
Where did this come from?

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,427
I don't know.

88
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,426
You really think this looks
okay on me?

89
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,464
Fabulous. Perfect fit.
And it's the last one we have.

90
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:32,095
I'm sorry. You can't tell me
where the mannequin came from?

91
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,763
I told you. I don't know.

92
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:41,473
Well, is there somebody around here
I could talk to who would know?

93
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,346
Why?

94
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,485
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin
looks exactly like me.

95
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,947
Did you just roll your eyes at him?

96
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,019
If anybody should be
rolling their eyes...

97
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,684
...it is me at him about you.

98
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,529
I think maybe
you're flattering yourself.

99
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,670
That mannequin is wearing
a $1200 Gaultier dress.

100
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,507
What are you saying, that I'm not
good enough for this hideous dress?

101
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,801
Listen, Natasha...

102
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,013
I wouldn't be caught dead...

103
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,116
...wearing your crummy
little Eurotrash rags.

104
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,912
I'll meet you outside.

105
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,587
- What is her problem?
- What can you do?

106
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,093
Is this the price tag?

107
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,493
- Yes.
- Yes, hello. Party's over.

108
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,930
I'll tell you a little secret.
We're having an unadvertised sale...

109
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,764
...starting Friday.
That suit will be half-price.

110
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,429
You think you could put it
aside and hold it for me?

111
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,268
I'm afraid I couldn't do that.

112
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,968
It wouldn't be fair
to the other customers.

113
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,306
Oh, yes, of course.

114
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,073
And we have to be fair.

115
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,120
So...

116
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,125
...I found out who supplies
the mannequins and I called him up.

117
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,028
- How did they get your face?
- I don't know, they wouldn't tell me.

118
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,501
Jerry?

119
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,594
Hello?

120
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,370
Excuse me.

121
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,103
I noticed you offered her
a piece of your pie.

122
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,803
That's right.

123
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,210
- And you waved it away.
- Right.

124
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,615
- Did you give her a reason?
- Yes.

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,617
- I was full.
- You were full.

126
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,314
So you gave a reason.
You didn't just shake your head.

127
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,052
- No. I'm not a psycho.
- Exactly.

128
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,824
You're not a psycho.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,063
You've been very helpful. Thank you
very much. Allow me to leave the tip.

130
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,402
Well, I think we've proven
who the psycho is.

131
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,908
We certainly have.

132
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,142
Hey, Elaine, scratch my back.

133
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,977
- No way.
- One lap around.

134
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,017
- No.
- It'll be a funky adventure.

135
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,450
- Kramer, forget it.
- Jerry, how about you?

136
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,523
I think you know my policy.

137
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,125
I'm going home to spatula.

138
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,423
I thought George
was meeting us here.

139
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,624
No. He's going downtown
to guard the suit.

140
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,002
He's guarding a suit?

141
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,373
Do you need some
help with that itch?

142
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,941
Madam, I pray
you're not toying with me.

143
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,643
- Turn around.
- Oh, all right.

144
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,132
- It fits you perfectly.
- You think so?

145
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,636
What is this? Can't I leave
this place for a second?

146
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,815
Can I help you?

147
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,986
I'm buying this suit.

148
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,326
- No. This suit is not for sale.
- Excuse me, do you work here?

149
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,495
No.

150
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,732
Then what the hell
business is it of yours?

151
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,426
I'm doing you a favor.

152
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,366
They're having
an unadvertised sale.

153
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,666
This suit will be
half-price starting Monday.

154
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,368
- Really? This Monday?
- Yes. Take off those pants.

155
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,241
Actually, the unadvertised sale
starts on Friday.

156
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,649
Friday? Thanks.

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,178
You know, for an unadvertised sale,
you're doing a lot of yapping about it.

158
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,263
I can't believe
your father owns this place.

159
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,939
So how are the desserts here?

160
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,542
Everything is delicious.

161
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,409
- You've tasted them?
- I think almost all of them.

162
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,079
Oh, I see they have apple pie.

163
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,054
- You've had the apple pie?
- Many times.

164
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,090
Audrey, I gotta be honest with you.

165
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,666
I'm a very curious guy.
It's my nature. I need to know things.

166
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,430
Not tasting the apple pie
the other day, I can't get past it.

167
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,403
You obviously like pies.

168
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,874
You carry doughnuts in your bag.
You're not averse to pastry.

169
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,740
Surely you could see how such
a thing would prey on my mind.

170
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,075
- Can we drop this?
- Why can't I know?

171
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,512
- Oh, Poppie.
- Sweetheart, hello.

172
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,145
Poppie, this is Jerry.

173
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,284
- Welcome.
- Hello, Poppie.

174
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,090
Don't fill up on the bread.

175
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,127
I'm making you
a very special dinner.

176
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,196
Very special.

177
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,734
The pies.

178
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,633
I'm going to the bathroom.
You know.

179
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,012
Ah, Jerry!

180
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,387
Tonight you're in for a real treat.

181
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,182
I'm personally gonna
prepare the dinner...

182
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,417
...for you and my Audrey.

183
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,444
Jerry, are you okay?

184
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,513
Is anything wrong?

185
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,376
No. Nothing.

186
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,346
You look like you've seen a ghost.

187
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,164
I'll see you tomorrow.

188
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,632
Hey.

189
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,374
- These are for you, Olive.
- Thank you.

190
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,218
Here it is.

191
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,389
Oh, wait till you taste this.

192
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,158
Poppie, this is perfect.

193
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,332
Well?

194
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,371
Jerry, have some.

195
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,472
You're not gonna taste it?

196
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,675
Jerry.

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,294
So she thought I did it
to get back at her.

198
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,760
Why didn't you just tell her?

199
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,832
It's not the kind of thing
you wanna hear about your father.

200
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,962
When he came out of that bathroom,
and he was kneading that dough...

201
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,463
...it was a wild scene.

202
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,403
How could he not have washed?

203
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,601
Even if you're not gonna soap up...

204
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,778
...at least pretend, for my benefit.
Turn the water on. Do something.

205
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,517
Yeah, just like I do.

206
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,919
You know, a chef who doesn't wash
is like a cop who steals.

207
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,526
It's a cry for help.
He wants to get caught.

208
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,458
I think Poppie's got some problems.

209
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,190
There's a whole other thing
going on with Poppie.

210
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,958
- So how did you leave it?
- We haven't spoken.

211
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,505
Hey. Hey, George.
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

212
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,368
I got Olive.

213
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,803
- Olive?
- My lady friend down at Monk's.

214
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,542
You guys ought to see the way
she works her nails across my back.

215
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,146
She's a maestro- The crisscross...

216
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,485
...the figure eight,
strumming the old banjo...

217
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,651
...and this wild, savage free-for-all...

218
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,660
...where anything can happen.

219
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,356
I gotta get downtown
and buy that suit.

220
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,970
- Store opens in 20 minutes.
- Is that Elaine mannequin still there?

221
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,004
Yeah. The last time I saw her...

222
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,509
...she was naked.

223
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,207
Yeah. And Poppie's got problems.

224
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,020
Where is it? Where is it?

225
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,720
Well, look at this.

226
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,523
This doesn't belong here.

227
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,696
Someone has made
a terrible mistake.

228
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,131
You bastard!

229
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,236
- You hid the suit.
- Hid?

230
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,433
I have no idea
how this suit got misplaced.

231
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,405
Nevertheless, I do believe
I shall purchase it.

232
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,879
I hope you rot in that suit.

233
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,281
I'll get you for this. I don't know how,
but I'm gonna get you.

234
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,547
- You are gonna pay.
- Oh, I'll pay.

235
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,849
Half-price.

236
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,620
<i>Arrivederci, my fellow 40-short.</i>

237
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,598
I made a list of people who might
have made the mannequin.

238
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,861
You know, possible suspects.

239
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,369
- Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
- Okay.

240
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,704
All right, well, there's this blind guy
at a party I was at...

241
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,870
...and he felt my face
for a really long time...

242
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,844
...to see what I looked like.

243
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,484
He almost put
his finger up my nose.

244
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,950
- What else you got?
- Okay.

245
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,850
I won't tell you the rest of the list.

246
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,888
Because I didn't think
the blind guy did it?

247
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,787
Because you have an attitude.

248
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,196
Oh, Georgie.

249
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,665
- Nice duds.
- You're telling me.

250
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,976
So, what do you think?

251
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,944
- Did you hear something?
- Yeah, like a swoosh.

252
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,446
Yeah.

253
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,250
It must be the fabric.

254
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,820
It's rubbing between your thighs
when you walk.

255
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,720
That's what's making
that swooshy sound.

256
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,859
I didn't hear it on the way over
because of the street noise.

257
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,936
This is no good!

258
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,543
I gotta meet these guys
from MacKenzie for lunch!

259
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,606
So what? What would they care?

260
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,942
This MacKenzie guy,
he's a bit of a nut.

261
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,382
He fired the last guy because
his nose whistled when he breathed.

262
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,318
So you're not gonna get the job
because your pants make noise?

263
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,651
Let's say it's between me
and one other guy.

264
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,624
He's got a quiet suit,
and I'm whooshing all over the place!

265
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,627
Who do you think he's gonna hire?

266
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,062
All these interviews
are making you nuts.

267
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,565
Jerry, I saw your girlfriend
was in here before.

268
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,466
- Audrey?
- Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.

269
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,507
- Was it apple?
- What else?

270
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,008
This woman is bending
my mind into a pretzel.

271
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,909
Do I know you?

272
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,145
No, you don't.

273
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,149
Yeah.

274
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,483
You were wearing a G-string
and one of those bras with points.

275
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,389
The mannequin!

276
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,260
Oh, I gotta see this thing.

277
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,206
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.

278
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,044
You think you can pose me
however you want?

279
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,647
That's my ass in your window.

280
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,218
It's our mannequin.
We can do whatever we want.

281
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,412
No. You take that mannequin
down right now...

282
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,988
...or I am pressing charges.
Yes. This is my attorney.

283
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,252
Yeah? What law am I breaking?

284
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,730
I believe there is some
legal precedent...

285
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,196
<i>...Winchell v. Mahoney.
The Charlie McCarthy hearings.</i>

286
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,599
- Are you taking this down?
- I'm getting the manager.

287
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,969
- Jerry, get the car.
- What are you doing?

288
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,301
- Just get the car.
- As your legal counsel...

289
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,671
...I must advise against this.

290
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,421
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
a hankering for some Doublemint gum.

291
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm dropping you off at work, right?

292
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,950
Where are you going?

293
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,457
Poppie's.

294
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,199
Thanks for meeting me
down here, George.

295
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,734
My office is out of control. Phones
ringing, people running in and out.

296
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,069
Did you hear something?

297
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,176
No, I didn't hear anything.

298
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,910
That's strange.

299
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,909
It's quieter down here.

300
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,018
We can concentrate without
people whooshing around.

301
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,488
That sound again.

302
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,184
Sure you didn't hear anything?

303
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,363
No, can't say as I did.

304
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,625
Kind of like a...

305
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,427
...rustling.

306
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,433
Could be the leaves.

307
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,739
That's right. Poppie's on 77th.

308
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,505
Okay. We'll see you at 8.
Bye-bye.

309
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,909
Hello.

310
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,515
- What are you doing here?
- So how was the pie?

311
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,847
- What pie?
- The apple pie...

312
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,488
...you had today at Monk's.

313
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,691
- I'm very busy here.
- Pretty good, wasn't it?

314
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,885
I told you you should've tasted it.

315
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,729
You better not let
Poppie see you.

316
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,990
All right, I'm looking for Poppie.

317
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,031
- Who are you?
- Board of Health.

318
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,669
- We've had complaints.
- Oh, about the, uh...

319
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,337
- You Poppie?
- I'm Poppie.

320
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,176
Think you better come with me.

321
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,504
What's the problem?

322
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,508
What do they want from Poppie?

323
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,946
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.

324
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,624
You thought I'd care
about your pants whooshing?

325
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,989
I heard the last guy got fired
because his nose whistled.

326
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,258
No. He got fired because
he wasn't a team player.

327
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,665
That's something we don't joke
about at MacKenzie.

328
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,002
We're a team here.
We don't tolerate dissent.

329
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,767
You wanna go your own way,
you're in the wrong place.

330
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,212
No problem there.

331
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,747
Conformity's an obsession with me.

332
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,717
Chocolate cream pie,
compliments of the house.

333
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,045
Hope you saved room for dessert.

334
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,351
The chef said that
he made it special for you.

335
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,563
Best pie I've ever tasted.

336
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,394
Take a bite, George.

337
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,131
Take a bite.

338
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,433
It's delicious.

339
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,133
I insist.

340
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,109
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.

341
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,283
- So you didn't get the job?
- No.

342
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,216
But I was the only one at the table
that didn't get violently ill.

343
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,355
Kramer, you can't keep
avoiding her like this.

344
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,325
- You have to say something.
- What?

345
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,931
- Tell her you lost your itch.
- What happened to it?

346
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
I lost it two days ago.

347
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,899
I've been faking it
so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.

348
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,801
You should tell her.

349
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,537
I'll let her down easy.

350
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,643
All right.

351
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,847
Well. Hi, Olive.

352
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,813
No, no. No more of that.

353
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,012
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What?

354
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,147
Well, there's someone else.

355
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,985
- Someone else?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,683
Who is she?

357
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,658
Her.

358
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,032
- Her?
- Yeah. There she is.

359
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,326
- That's my gal.
- You're a liar.

360
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,800
I've seen her before.
She's not your girlfriend.

361
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,598
Now, Olive, look, I'm sorry.

362
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,071
Why is she wearing her underwear?

363
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,107
Well, it's a style.

364
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,376
Jerry, give me the keys.

365
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:26,714
Well, I guess we're gonna go
for a drive now. She really loves that.

366
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,477
You ever solve the riddle of the pie?

367
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,046
No, that's one for the ages.

368
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,681
But I think they're gonna put
Poppie away for a long, long time.

369
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,996
You're not gonna believe this.

370
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,657
I just got a letter
from a friend of mine in Chicago...

371
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,965
...who was shopping, and she saw
a mannequin that looked just like me.

372
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,073
What if there are more?
Where are they coming from?

373
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,147
Ricky, we've been getting
a tremendous response...

374
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,942
...to your TR-6 mannequin.

375
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,584
TR-6?

376
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,516
I prefer to think of her as...

377
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,888
...Elaine.
