1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,004
With a serial killer,
it's safest to be a neighbor.

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,175
They never kill the neighbor.
The neighbor survives to do...

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,175
...the interview afterwards, right?
"He was kind of quiet."

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,575
These neighbors,
they're never disturbed...

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,181
...by the sounds of murdering.
Just stereo.

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,181
Chain saws, people screaming, fine.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,684
Just keep the music down.

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,250
And women who fall in love
with the killer.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:28,224
They write to him in prison. Here's
a woman that's hard to disappoint.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,258
She's only upset
when she finds out...

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,591
...he's stopped killing people.
And she goes:

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,394
"You know, sometimes I feel like I don't
even know who you are anymore."

13
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,007
<i>No. Eight years
isn't such a long streak.</i>

14
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,443
- It isn't?
- No. I haven't vomited in 13 years.

15
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,877
- Get out.
- Not since June 29th, 1980.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,850
You remember the date?

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,926
Yes. Because my previous vomit
was also June 29th, 1972.

18
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,622
That's why during the '80 vomit
I was yelling to George:

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:10,201
"Can you believe it?
I'm vomiting on June 29th again."

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,401
When Joel told me he hadn't
thrown up in eight years...

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,599
<i>- ... I was wondering if he was normal.
- No, Elaine, he's normal.</i>

22
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,437
Your boyfriend is normal.
He just has the same name...

23
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,944
...as one of the worst serial killers
in history.

24
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,946
Oh, Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,746
- Hi.
- Hey.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,889
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,388
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. What's his name?

28
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,457
- Joel.
- Joel what?

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,092
Rifkin.

30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,455
- Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
- Yeah. It's just a coincidence...

31
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,464
- ...obviously.
- Guess you better...

32
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,296
...keep on his good side.

33
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,103
Very funny. That's very funny.

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,401
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him if I were you.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,737
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that. Enough.

36
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,608
If you smell anything
decaying in his car's trunk-

37
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,079
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about.

38
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,980
He's a gentleman. He's good-looking,
he's a good shaver.

39
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,920
And he hasn't thrown up in eight years,
so just shut up about him. Shut up!

40
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,858
The whole city is talking
about this monster, Joel Rifkin.

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,861
And I am dating a Joel Rifkin.

42
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:17,935
- But you like your Joel Rifkin.
- Yeah. I wish he had a different name.

43
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,765
Ask him to change it.

44
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,601
You can't ask a person
to change their name.

45
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,107
- Why not?
- Would you change yours?

46
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,336
If someone asked me nicely.

47
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,512
I'm Claude Seinfeld.

48
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,617
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?

49
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,151
Yeah, 18 strangles.

50
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,448
You know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?

51
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,649
Because he was adopted.

52
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,785
Just like Son of Sam was adopted.

53
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,864
So apparently, adoption leads
to serial killing.

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,304
Joel and I have an extra ticket
to the Giants game.

55
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,963
- I'll go.
- Okay.

56
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,240
- I'll leave a ticket for you at will call.
- Yeah!

57
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,139
Should I have asked George?

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,648
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?

59
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,650
- Karen?
- Risotto.

60
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,853
I feel full after the risotto.

61
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,719
- Oh, the risotto broad.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,986
He's got a good thing with her.
I'm doubling with them tonight.

63
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,556
- You don't like double dates.
- George does.

64
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,031
He feels it's a good
personality showcase.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,194
He likes a date to see him
with a friend...

66
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,896
...so she gets a window
into his non-date personality.

67
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,833
I've looked through that window and
screamed at him to shut the blinds.

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,877
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.

69
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,847
- And you're taking...?
- Jodi, the masseuse.

70
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,213
- Hey, did you get a massage yet?
- No.

71
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,618
How many times do I have to go out
with her before I get a massage?

72
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,518
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She
doesn't want to give them on dates.

73
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,061
Yeah, I know. She just wants
to have sex.

74
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,630
So what?

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,360
It's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.

76
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,434
I like carrots, but I'm in Idaho,
I want a potato.

77
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,369
So I go into this clothing store,
and the saleswoman is wearing this...

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,070
...low-cut thing.

79
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,410
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?

80
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,281
When you put on a top like that,
what's your thought process?

81
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,648
What's going on in your mind?"

82
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,585
That is so funny.

83
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,959
- You listening to this?
- Yeah, I heard you.

84
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,722
Boy, my neck is killing me.

85
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,634
It's right in this spot.
Very tender over here.

86
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,600
So, what did she say?

87
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,968
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.

88
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,741
You just said you said it.

89
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,539
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.

90
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,410
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.

91
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,279
I've never seen you like this.

92
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,080
It's like somebody's
pulling on wires back here.

93
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,320
It's like, you never see
a really attractive woman...

94
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,155
...getting a traffic ticket.

95
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,821
How can you say that?
My sister got a ticket last week.

96
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,763
Are you saying she's not attractive?

97
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,000
Obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.

98
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,765
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,000
- Can we go?
- So soon?

100
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,611
- Yeah. Good seeing you again, Karen.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,873
- Nice meeting you, Karen.
- Yeah, I'll call about that massage.

102
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,640
- Yeah.
- Let's do this again soon.

103
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,683
Yeah.

104
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,316
- I strained my neck last night.
- Really, how?

105
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,019
I tried brushing my teeth
by holding the brush...

106
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,825
...and moving my head
from side to side.

107
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,990
It didn't work.

108
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,065
So, what's the deal
with your friend George?

109
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,671
No deal. Why?

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,105
What was all that " attractive women
not getting tickets" nonsense?

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,643
Well, he was just showcasing
his non-date personality.

112
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,342
How can you hang out with him?

113
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,974
Yeah, sometimes
it really makes me tense.

114
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,313
Did you see
the way that he was eating?

115
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,481
Yeah, he's disgusting.

116
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,926
I have to tell you,
I really don't like him.

117
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,098
- Yeah, me either.
- It's just I hate that type.

118
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,165
He's a bad seed.

119
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,502
Now, you, however, you, I like.

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,374
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

121
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,683
- So, what do you think?
- Really enjoyed it.

122
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,715
- Jodi's nice.
- She's very nice.

123
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,651
Let's discuss this later.

124
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,347
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.

125
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,289
- I was personable, don't you think?
- You were extremely personable.

126
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,398
Because I thought I picked up
a little something.

127
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,229
I'm very good at this.
Did you pick up anything?

128
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:49,067
- I didn't pick up anything.
- The second time I sent noodles back...

129
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,873
...I thought she made a face.

130
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,769
I didn't see a face.

131
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,742
I thought I saw a face.

132
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,783
- What is the difference?
- No difference. I could care less.

133
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,888
- She's Jerry's girlfriend.
- George, instead of talking about this...

134
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,183
...we could be... You know.

135
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,988
So you think she liked me?

136
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,069
- What are you doing?
- Massaging your neck.

137
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,569
Of course. Massaging.

138
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,737
Boning up on football?

139
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,417
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?

140
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:36,316
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.

141
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,314
What a cool name, Deion.

142
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,017
If I were gonna change my name,
I'd go with Deion.

143
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,997
Deion Benes?

144
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,926
Well, as a woman,
it makes no sense.

145
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,935
But I mean...
Well, let's say I was you.

146
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,333
And I decided I was gonna
change my name-

147
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,872
For no real reason whatsoever.

148
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,666
Deion Rifkin.

149
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,539
That is so cool.

150
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,384
Deion Rifkin?

151
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,051
Well, maybe you're not
the Deion type.

152
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,817
Okay, then let's see, let's see,
what do we got? Oh, oh, oh, O.J.

153
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,759
O.J. Rifkin. Oh, you don't even use
a name. It's just initials.

154
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,127
Oh, please, please, change your name
to O.J. It would be so great.

155
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,666
Elaine, what is going on?

156
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,475
- She stayed over?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,971
- Sex wasn't so good?
- No. Sex was fabulous.

158
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,516
- So?
- I want the massage.

159
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,686
- Did you ask her?
- I put her hands there.

160
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,585
She just pulls it away immediately.
She's not into it.

161
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,350
- Why not?
- I guess because it's her job.

162
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,088
It's very frustrating.

163
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,192
So we had a good time,
the four of us.

164
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,995
- Yeah.
- We all got along.

165
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,660
- Everyone seemed very pleasant.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,397
- What did Jodi say?
- She had a good time.

167
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,508
- Is that it?
- Pretty much.

168
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,844
She say anything about...?

169
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,346
- What?
- No, no. It's all right. Great.

170
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,882
She had a good time.

171
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,080
Yeah.

172
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,586
- You hesitated.
- I was blowing on the coffee.

173
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,553
She didn't like me.

174
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,557
It's not like you'll be spending
a lot of time with her.

175
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,129
So she doesn't like me?

176
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,356
No.

177
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,570
- She said that?
- Yes.

178
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,905
- She told you she doesn't like me?
- Yes.

179
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,743
- What were her exact-?
- "I don't like him."

180
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,615
Why didn't she like me?

181
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,115
- Not everybody likes everybody.
- I wasn't nice?

182
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,653
- You were very nice.
- I bent over backwards for that woman!

183
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,258
- Was it what I said about her sister?
- It has nothing to do with her.

184
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,396
I don't even know her sister!
But if she's getting tickets...

185
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,794
...she's not that good-looking!

186
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,663
You vomited in 1987.

187
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,735
Oh, no. That was the dry heaves.

188
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,770
- Jodi.
- Hi, Jerry.

189
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,241
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

190
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,938
- I was giving Kramer a massage.
- Kramer.

191
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,008
Gotta run, I have an appointment.

192
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,983
- Let me take your table.
- That's okay.

193
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,621
Please. I love to help people.

194
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,350
This is what I do.
Come on, I'm going this way.

195
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,153
I'll see you tonight.

196
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,126
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn.

197
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,293
Who told you to get a massage?
I haven't gotten one from her!

198
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,929
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing, buddy.

199
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,109
No one hails a cab like me.

200
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,176
My hailing technique is unmatched.

201
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,438
See, I get the wrist going
side to side and:

202
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,447
Cabs are crashing into themselves
to just pick me up.

203
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,711
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.

204
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,548
Feminists aside,
I know women like the door-holding.

205
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,284
Here we are. Alrighty. Good. Okay.

206
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,018
Let's get together again soon.

207
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,390
- Say hello to your sister.
- You've never met.

208
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,660
Whatever. If I wasn't involved right
now, I wouldn't mind being set up.

209
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,998
Something tells me
she's a knockout!

210
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,196
But first, she sets
the mood perfectly...

211
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:19,400
...with this New Age music
played over ocean sounds.

212
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,739
Then she lays you out on this table.

213
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:27,877
And she proceeds to rub oil
over your entire body.

214
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,989
And she rubs long and deep.

215
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,683
Jerry, she rubs with love.

216
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,489
Every muscle she touches
just oozes...

217
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,366
...beneath those silky, soft fingers.

218
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,369
You can scarcely
contain yourself, buddy.

219
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,565
- So you had a good time, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,040
- Enjoyed yourself?
- Very much.

221
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,374
All right, now, you listen,
and you listen good!

222
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,248
- What?
- The massages are out!

223
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,577
- What-?
- They're out!

224
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,687
- Why?
- If I can't get one, you're not!

225
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,984
Wait a minute. I need my massages.
Can't you see I'm burned out?

226
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:15,563
- I'm sorry, Kramer.
- Why, why? Look, I paid for her!

227
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,133
Don't you ever
talk about her like that!

228
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,002
- Yeah, but why?!
- Final!

229
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,137
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Giants Stadium.</i>

230
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,747
- Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
- Yeah.

231
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,818
- Why, is that weird?
- No, it's normal.

232
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,457
You're very normal.
You're totally normal.

233
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,457
- Who's this?
- That's my mother.

234
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,823
Oh, yeah. I see the resemblance.

235
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,933
- No, there's no resemblance.
- Yeah, there is. Right here-

236
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,332
Elaine, I was adopted.

237
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,141
Oh, that's nice.

238
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,438
Oh, the game's about to start.
I wonder where your friend Kramer is.

239
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,680
Yeah, a ticket for Kramer?

240
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,781
- Here it is. I need some ID.
- Oh, yeah.

241
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,586
- You know, I forgot my wallet.
- Well, I can't give it to you then.

242
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,593
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm afraid not.

243
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,171
Come on, just look at me.
Now tell me I'm not Kramer.

244
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,667
- I'm sorry. I need proof.
- Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow...

245
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,311
...and I'll show you the ID.

246
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,379
I got nothing to do all day.

247
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,014
Neither do I.

248
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,049
But without ID...

249
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,279
...I need confirmation
from the person who left the ticket.

250
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,719
Where's a phone?

251
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,654
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.</i>

252
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,568
<i>Would Joel Rifkin
report to the stadium office.</i>

253
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,966
<i>Joel Rifkin, telephone.</i>

254
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,106
Who would be calling me here?

255
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,804
He's not the murderer.

256
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,182
Oh, God.

257
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,251
- What's the matter with you?
- Jerry, I need another massage.

258
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,859
You just had one.
What do you need another one for?

259
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,725
Because of the Giant game.
I told you, it went overtime.

260
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,390
You know those seats.
They're very unforgiving.

261
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,433
- Oh, please.
- And then the game-winning field goal...

262
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:37,735
...went over the net and into the crowd,
and I dove over three rows.

263
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,173
My back, it's killing me.

264
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,045
It's killing me, Jerry!

265
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,910
- Well, did you get the ball?
- Oh, I got the ball.

266
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,281
I never caught a foul ball
at a baseball game.

267
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,046
Well, it's quite a thrill.

268
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,250
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody does it like she does.

269
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,588
- She's the best.
- Tonight's the night.

270
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,197
I'm getting one. No ifs, ands or buts.

271
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,563
- Well, what about my massage?
- Ask Newman.

272
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,740
So I lugged that table,
that big, heavy massage table...

273
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,673
...all the way down to the cab!

274
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,271
- You ever see one of those things?
- Of course.

275
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,783
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you haven't.

276
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,249
You know. Not everybody's seen
a massage table.

277
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,114
You think I've never
had a massage?

278
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,758
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you.
I don't get it.

279
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,122
George, frankly, I'm getting
a little tired of hearing about her.

280
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,456
I wanna know what I did
to this woman.

281
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,460
You got a little thing for her?

282
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,999
No, no. She's going out
with a friend of mine.

283
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,637
It's only courteous
to try and like each other.

284
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,569
What's the difference?
Who cares if she doesn't like you.

285
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,835
Does everybody in the world
have to like you?

286
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,447
Yes. Yes. Everybody has to like me.
I must be liked.

287
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:57,419
Of course I support your decision
to change your name.

288
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,326
After the Giant game, I realized
that this problem isn't going away.

289
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,529
Well, listen,
I just want you to know...

290
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,132
...that I was more than willing
to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.

291
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,997
Sure.

292
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,474
- Okay, you got your list?
- Yeah, yeah. Ten names.

293
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,042
- Great.
- Okay, and if somebody objects...

294
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,711
- ...you can just veto it.
- Okay.

295
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,042
Okay, you start.
What's your first choice?

296
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,810
- Stuart.
- No. Second choice.

297
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,477
Stuart's no good?

298
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,491
I have never met a normal guy
named Stuart.

299
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,553
Okay. My second choice is Todd.

300
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,528
Todd.

301
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,461
No. Veto.

302
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,364
All right.

303
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,337
Hey, I think you're gonna like
my third choice.

304
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,634
- Oh, great.
- Alex.

305
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,407
I gotta tell you, I have
a bad association with the name Alex.

306
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:01,049
- Bad association?
- In college, I sat next to an Alex...

307
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,347
...in art history.
He always drank coffee...

308
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,013
...and after every sip, he would go:

309
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,028
I mean, every two seconds:

310
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,290
And he would take, like, 40 sips,
and after every one:

311
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,197
I had to drop the class.

312
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,764
- Hey.
- Hi.

313
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,272
I was running late,
and I didn't have a chance...

314
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,502
...to drop off my stuff
before I came over.

315
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,543
Oh, no problem. That's fine.

316
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,113
What's with this music?

317
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,841
It's New Age music.

318
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,214
Sounds of the forest.

319
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,855
I find it soothing.

320
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,726
Look at this. What do you know?
A massage table.

321
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,618
This is great.

322
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,594
- What are you doing?
- Just checking it out.

323
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,132
Look at how this thing is made.

324
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,771
Can I tell you something?
That's a hell of a piece of equipment.

325
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:59,535
- Actually, I should get a new one.
- Nonsense. This one's fine.

326
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,541
- So where do you wanna go?
- Go? Why go anywhere?

327
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,110
That feels good.

328
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,153
Yeah, that's...

329
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,585
That's good.

330
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,328
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice.

331
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,561
No. No, this isn't good.
I can't do this.

332
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,398
Why? What's wrong?

333
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,064
- I can't.
- No. Yes, you can.

334
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,472
- No, I can't.
- Yes. Come on, I know...

335
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,134
...it's something you wanna do.

336
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,283
You know what?

337
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,121
I should go talk to her.

338
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,352
Nothing confrontational.
Just two adults sitting down...

339
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,959
...trying to clear the air.

340
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,785
I know if I could spend
some time alone with her...

341
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,695
- I've got to. I've got to.
- You're going now?

342
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,629
Well, I think I can still catch her.

343
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,666
All right, George, I have had
just about enough of this.

344
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,170
- What are you talking about?
- I am talking about you and Jodi.

345
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,310
You're completely
obsessed with her.

346
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,435
I know. I know.

347
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,975
Who is more important to you,
her or me?

348
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,608
I like you, she doesn't.
Who you gonna pick?

349
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm sorry, Karen. I care for you...

350
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,928
...but I can't stand
when someone doesn't like me.

351
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,191
- Well, now I hate you!
- That, I'm used to.

352
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,563
- Ned?
- What is wrong with Ned?

353
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:39,067
Ned's a guy who buys
irregular underwear. Next.

354
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,674
- Ellis.
- Ellis? You might as well go with Alex.

355
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,752
- It's the same thing.
- Ellis and Alex aren't even close.

356
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,251
- Next!
- Oh, what's the point?

357
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,483
- Now, no, come on!
- Okay. Okay.

358
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,889
Remy.

359
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,424
Remy Rifkin?

360
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,263
Should I get a beret?

361
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,032
Oh, Stuart's a lot better.

362
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,007
Little Stuart Rifkin
likes to go shopping with his mother.

363
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,904
What do you mean, no?

364
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,707
No means no.

365
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,010
Who you kidding?
You come to my apartment...

366
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:25,589
...with your table and your little oils.
I'm not supposed to expect anything?

367
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,016
You're a massage teaser.

368
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,696
Listen, I massage who I want
when I want.

369
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,992
I don't submit to forcible massage.

370
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,739
- I'm getting out of here.
- Fine, go.

371
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,610
Jerry, could you excuse us
for a few minutes, please?

372
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,450
- What for?
- We need to talk.

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,923
- You need to talk?
- We have nothing to talk about.

374
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,823
Look, it's no secret
what's going on between us.

375
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,058
She doesn't like me.
Now, Jerry, if you don't mind...

376
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,226
George, anything you have to say
to her, you can say in front of me.

377
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,765
Jerry...

378
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,003
...this woman hates me so much...

379
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,613
...I'm starting to like her.

380
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,852
- What?
- She just dislikes me so much...

381
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,249
...it's irresistible.

382
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,789
- I can see that.
- I'm getting out of here.

383
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,252
- Don't call me.
- Don't worry.

384
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,097
A woman that hates me this much
comes along once in a lifetime.

385
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,663
You're a lucky guy.

386
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,702
I gotta go after her.

387
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,308
George.

388
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,136
I wouldn't push for the massage.

389
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,979
Jodi!

390
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,058
Swedes are big massagers. They like
Swedish meatballs, Swedish massage.

391
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,164
They like having meat in their hands,
these people.

392
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,563
But it's weird.
They have a high suicide rate.

393
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,726
They're always rubbing
each other's necks.

394
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,168
For a neutral country,
they seem kind of tense.

395
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,506
I don't like the idea of
a professional massage.

396
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,237
I don't want people touching me
that don't wanna have sex with me.

397
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,177
You get me all loosened up,
juices flowing, then:

398
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,615
"That's it. Okay, you're done."

399
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,981
Like having chocolate
rubbed over your face.

400
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:41,387
You wanna go, "Excuse me.
I think you missed a spot."
