1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,363
I love these nature shows.

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,104
And it's amazing
how you can always relate.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,798
You're watching the
African dung beetle and going:

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,410
"Boy, his life is a lot like mine."

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,747
You always root for whichever animal
is the star of the show.

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,509
Like, if it's the antelope,
and a lion's chasing it...

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,712
...you go, "Run, antelope, run.
Use your speed. Get away."

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,953
Then next week it's the lion...

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,060
...and then you go, "Get the antelope.
Eat him. Bite his ass!

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,287
Trap him.
Don't let him use his speed."

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,897
Well, did he bring it up
in the meeting?

12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,097
Elaine, see this T-shirt?

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,801
Six years, I've had this T-shirt.
It's my best one.

14
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,141
I call him Golden Boy.

15
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,372
Yeah. I'm on the phone here.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,678
Golden Boy's always the first shirt
I wear out of the laundry. Here.

17
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,151
Touch Golden Boy.

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,551
No, thanks.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll hold.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,285
But, see, look at the collar.
It's fraying.

20
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,986
Golden Boy is slowly dying.

21
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,456
Each wash brings him
one step closer.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,464
That's what makes it
such a tragic figure.

23
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,262
Why don't you just let Golden Boy...

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,405
- ...soak in the sink with some Woolite.
- No.

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,771
The reason he's the iron man...

26
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,000
...is because he goes out
and plays every game.

27
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,338
Wash, spin, rinse, spin.

28
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,777
If you take that away from him,
you break his spirit.

29
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,041
Yeah.

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,515
What? He is?

31
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,917
Oh, that's fantastic. I'm so excited.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,422
Yes, I'm excited. Okay.
Okay, I'll be in soon.

33
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,083
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.
Okay, bye.

34
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,958
- Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer.
- The guy who was in the gulag?

35
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,124
Yeah. Pendant's publishing his new
book and I'm gonna work on it.

36
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,931
Lippman and I are gonna go to the
airport and pick him up in a limousine.

37
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,701
You wanna borrow Golden Boy?

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,942
Do you know what this means?
It's like working with Tolstoy.

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,637
I read an unbelievable thing
about Tolstoy the other day.

40
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,180
<i>Did you know the original title
for War and Peace...</i>

41
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,215
<i>...was War-What is it Good For?</i>

42
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,622
No, I'm not kidding, Elaine. It's true.

43
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,850
His mistress didn't like the title...

44
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,119
<i>...and insisted he change it
to War and Peace.</i>

45
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,197
- But it's a line from that song.
- That's where they got it from.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,525
- Really?
- I'm not joking.

47
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,405
You can't handle the truth.

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,977
What?

49
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,706
I'm working on my Jack Nicholson.

50
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,540
You can't handle the truth.

51
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,216
- What is this, your mail?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,324
I grabbed it on the way out.
I don't want my mother reading it.

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,754
Your alumni magazine.

54
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,293
- Your mother reads your mail?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,160
- What do you mean, like postcards?
- No. Anything.

56
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,100
- She doesn't open.
- She'll open.

57
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,103
You've caught your mother
opening envelopes?

58
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,865
- Yes.
- What does she say?

59
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,168
"I was curious."

60
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,539
- Isn't that against the law?
- Maybe I can get her locked up.

61
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,783
Hey, Jerry, you're in the alumni
magazine. Listen to this:

62
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,943
"Jerry Seinfeld has appeared...

63
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,521
<i>...on David Letterman
and The Tonight Show...</i>

64
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,690
<i>...and he did a pilot
for NBC called Jerry...</i>

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,886
...that was not picked up."

66
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,195
Georgie, how come there's not
anything about you in here?

67
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,700
He can't handle the truth.

68
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,202
All right, this is too much fun.
I gotta get back to work.

69
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,843
You all right?

70
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,448
Yeah.

71
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,050
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

72
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,483
Yeah. Oh, hey, wait, wait.

73
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,389
Maybe you could use this.

74
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,182
Yeah.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,453
It's an electronic organizer.

76
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,124
- What?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,959
- What-?
- Yeah, here.

78
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,657
Yeah. You know...

79
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,168
...for phone numbers, addresses,
keep appointments, everything.

80
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,534
Yeah, it's got an alarm that beeps.

81
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,006
Oh, I can't believe this, Kramer.

82
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,442
I've been wanting to get one of
these things. Are you sure that-?

83
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,574
- Sure you can't use this thing?
- No.

84
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,082
I got all my appointments
right up here.

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,112
- Where'd you get this?
- The bank. I opened a new account.

86
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,626
Hey, did you see that whale thing
on TV last night?

87
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,022
No.

88
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,754
I am such a huge whale fan.

89
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,588
These marine biologists showed...

90
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,564
...how they communicate
with the squeaks and the squeals.

91
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,499
- What a fish.
- It's a mammal.

92
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,400
Whatever. Hey, new tape recorder?

93
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,542
Yeah, I got it from the bank.

94
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,645
Who wants to have some fun?

96
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,381
- I do.
- I do.

97
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,952
Now, are you just saying that,
or do you really wanna have fun?

98
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,520
I really wanna have fun.

99
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,816
I'm just saying
I wanna have some fun.

100
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,086
Right now, there are 600 Titleists...

101
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,722
...that I got from the driving range
in the trunk of my car.

102
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,099
Why don't we drive out
to Rockaway...

103
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,033
...and hit them...

104
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,332
...into the ocean!

105
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,374
Now picture this. We find a nice,
sweet spot between the dunes...

106
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,810
...we take out our drivers,
we tee up, and:

107
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,217
That ball goes sailing up
into the sky...

108
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,843
...holds there for a moment,
and then:

109
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,584
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,162
Let me stop by the cash machine,
and I'll meet you.

111
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,232
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.

112
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,498
- Keep your head down.
- Yeah.

113
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,203
Cash advance? Yes.

114
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,345
No. Balance inquiry?

115
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,002
No.

116
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,548
Receipt? No.

117
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,413
Processing, processing.

118
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,647
I won.

119
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,119
Jerry?

120
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,218
- Yeah.
- It's Diane.

121
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,296
- Diane DeConn from Queens College.
- Oh, Diane.

122
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,126
- How are you?
- Good.

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,097
- Good.
- How long has it been?

124
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,860
Since college.

125
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,305
I've seen you on TV.
You're doing great.

126
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,033
- Yeah, plugging along.
- I got the alumni magazine.

127
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,642
What ever happened to George?

128
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,641
I notice I never see his name
in there.

129
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,404
Well, he's kind of modest.

130
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,040
He was always such a goof-off.
I mean, did he ever get anywhere?

131
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,210
- Sure.
- Yeah? What field?

132
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,721
Marine biology.

133
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,881
George is a marine biologist?

134
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,787
Yeah. Pretty damn good one too.

135
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,056
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,256
- I would never have thought.
- Yeah. He's specializing in whales.

137
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,960
He's working on lowering
the cholesterol level in whales.

138
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,537
All that blubber. It's quite unhealthy.

139
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,470
It's the largest mammal
on Earth, but as George says...

140
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,109
...they don't have to be.

141
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,576
Diane DeConn?

142
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,443
You saw Diane DeConn?

143
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,608
- Something, huh?
- How did she look?

144
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,811
She looked great.

145
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,014
She asked about you.

146
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,090
She asked about me?
What did she say?

147
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,755
"How's George?"

148
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,856
George? She said George?

149
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,363
She remembered my name.

150
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,931
Diane DeConn
remembered my name.

151
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,764
She was the "it" girl.

152
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,442
She asked for your number. I think
she's gonna get in touch with you.

153
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,242
Okay, I'm telling you right now...

154
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,747
...if you're kidding, I'm not gonna
be able to be your friend anymore.

155
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,783
I'm serious about that. You got that?

156
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,285
- I got no problem with that.
- Good.

157
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,323
Because if this is a lie,
if this is a joke...

158
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,121
...if this is your idea of some
cute little game, we're finished.

159
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,390
Expect a call.

160
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,458
Oh, my God, he's not kidding.

161
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,165
Now...

162
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,327
...I should tell you...

163
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,875
...that at this point...

164
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,839
...she's under the impression
that you're a...

165
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,514
- A what?
- A marine biologist.

166
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,718
- A marine biologist?
- Yes.

167
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,660
Why am I a marine biologist?

168
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,231
I may have mentioned it.

169
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,328
But I'm not a marine biologist.

170
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,535
Yes, I know that.

171
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,538
So?

172
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,002
Why, you don't think
it's a good job?

173
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,805
I didn't even know it was a job.

174
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,011
Oh, it's a fascinating field.

175
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,452
Well, what if she calls me?

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,111
What am I supposed to say?

177
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,289
Algae.

178
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,393
Obviously plankton.

179
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,454
I don't know what else
I could tell you.

180
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,123
I just got back from a trip
to the Galápagos Islands.

181
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,632
I was living with turtles.

182
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,466
We have got you
in a very nice hotel.

183
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,699
I don't know how you like to work...

184
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,810
...but I can arrange
for an office if you like.

185
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,572
- I work in hotel. Is better.
- In the hotel.

186
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,012
Away from all your
little petty bickerings...

187
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,276
...and interference.

188
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,944
You know, Tolstoy used to write
in the village square.

189
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,750
The faces inspired him.

190
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,160
He did not need inspiration.

191
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,661
God spoke through his pen.

192
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,626
- That is so true.
- Yes.

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,429
<i>Although, one wonders
if War and Peace would have been...</i>

194
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,301
...as highly acclaimed, had it been
published under its original title...

195
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,068
<i>...War-What is it Good For?</i>

196
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,909
- What?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,741
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress
who insisted...

198
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,406
<i>- ... that he call it War and Peace.
- Elaine, Elaine.</i>

199
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,018
<i>War-What is it Good For?</i>

200
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,587
<i>Absolutely nothing
Say it again</i>

201
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,384
- Elaine.
- It's a song. They took it from Tolstoy.

202
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,527
<i>- No. Elaine.
- War...</i>

203
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,993
<i>- ... What is it Good For?
- It's her sense of humor.</i>

204
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,462
- No, it's not. That is true.
- What is that noise?

205
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,965
- No, it's not.
- That noise!

206
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,434
What is that noise? It's traveling
up my spine, into my brain.

207
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,167
- It's coming from your purse.
- It must be my new organizer.

208
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,776
- That noise.
- Turn it off.

209
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,504
- Right. I think it's this-
- I cannot stand it.

210
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,375
- It's the button at the top.
- Okay.

211
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,484
- Will you turn it off?
- Not the- The one at the top.

212
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,949
Give it to me.

213
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,794
I did it for you.

214
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,901
I don't know why
you had to tell her that.

215
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,596
You put me in a very difficult
position. Marine biologist.

216
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,139
I'm very uncomfortable
with this whole thing.

217
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,834
I would think it's right up your alley.

218
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,536
Well, it's not up my alley.

219
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,307
It's one thing if I make it up,
I know what I'm doing.

220
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,474
I know my alleys.

221
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,947
You got me in the Galápagos Islands
living with the turtles.

222
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,646
I don't know where the hell I am.

223
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,924
You came in the other day
with all that whale stuff...

224
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,651
...the squeaking and the squealing.

225
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,194
Look, why couldn't you
make me an architect?

226
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,026
You know I always wanted to pretend
I was an architect.

227
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,161
Well, I'm supposed
to see her tomorrow.

228
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,272
I'm gonna tell her what's going on.

229
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,533
I mean, maybe she
just likes me for me.

230
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,236
- Hey.
- Hey.

231
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,073
You want these?

232
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,714
I don't want them.

233
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,386
- Why?
- I stink!

234
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,283
I can't play.

235
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,584
The ball is just sitting there, Jerry,
and I can't hit it.

236
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,626
I only hit one really good ball
that went way out there.

237
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,254
- Well, what happened?
- I have no concentration.

238
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,934
- What's wrong with your-?
- Sand. I can't get rid of the sand.

239
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:51,168
Look at this. Look, there's still some
in here. It won't go away.

240
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,404
- Look, I even got sand in the pockets.
- You're getting it all over the floor.

241
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,808
Hello.

242
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,921
Yeah. Yes, it is.

243
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,682
Really?

244
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,889
Could you hold on a second?
Hey, listen to this.

245
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,552
A woman found an electronic
organizer. My name's in it.

246
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,131
- She wants help finding the owner.
- How'd she find it?

247
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,497
She's walking down the street
and it hit her in the head.

248
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,101
So I am walking along...

249
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,802
...minding my own business,
when all of a sudden...

250
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,244
...this thing comes flying
out of nowhere...

251
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,475
...and clonks me
right on the head.

252
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,675
Yeah.

253
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,083
- So they took me to the hospital.
- Yeah.

254
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,691
Yeah. And they put me in this thing
that feels like a coffin...

255
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,020
...for 45 minutes.

256
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,630
You ever been in one of those things?
You could go berserk in there.

257
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,527
- Well, you have insurance.
- I wish.

258
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,100
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

259
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,737
- What is with this thing?
- It never shuts up.

260
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,567
So anyway, you could see
why I would be interested...

261
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,800
- ...in finding this person.
- Absolutely.

262
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,376
You should not have to pay for that.

263
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,810
Stop it. Stop it!

264
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,244
Let me look at this thing.

265
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,613
Somebody told me they thought
they saw it come out of a limousine.

266
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,689
Typical rich people using the world
for their personal garbage can.

267
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,155
Boy, am I lucky your name came up.
I just pushed a button.

268
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,195
I want to know what my name's
doing in this creep's organizer.

269
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,525
- Yeah.
- Who do I know...

270
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,998
...who would have even been
in a limousine yesterday?

271
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,636
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. Great organizer you gave me.

272
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,244
You liked it, huh?

273
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,175
It wouldn't stop beeping in the car...

274
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,713
...so Testikov threw it
out the window.

275
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,179
I transferred everything in there.

276
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,549
I threw out my old book.
I'm lost now, Kramer.

277
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,492
- What? What is it?
- The sand. It's everywhere.

278
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,987
Okay, I'll see you later.

279
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,028
- Oh, there you are.
- There you are.

280
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,428
- So?
- So?

281
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,230
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- What do you have to say for yourself?

282
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,033
Why should I say anything
for myself?

283
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,575
<i>War-What is it Good For?</i>

284
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,778
Who told you?

285
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,779
Yuri Testikov...

286
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,718
...the Russian writer. Hello?

287
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,688
You told Testikov...

288
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,486
...that Tolstoy wanted
to name his book...

289
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,222
<i>...War-What is it Good For?</i>

290
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,231
And do you know what happened?

291
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,697
- Can I take a guess?
- Oh, please.

292
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,343
Oh, I don't know. He threw
your organizer out the window?

293
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,671
What? How do you know that?

294
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,576
- Because I know who has it.
- How did you find it?

295
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,980
The woman who got hit with it found
my name, called me, and we met.

296
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,780
- Where is it? Give it to me.
- I don't have it.

297
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,952
- Why not?
- She's not returning it...

298
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,820
...until she gets the money back
for the hospital bill.

299
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,929
But I didn't do it.
Testikov did it. He should pay for it.

300
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,724
How much is Testikov
getting from Pendant for this book?

301
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,528
- One million.
- Well, that's a start.

302
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,930
Then, of course, with evolution...

303
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,936
...the octopus lost the nostrils...

304
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,008
...and took on the more familiar look
that we know today.

305
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,438
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,047
But if you still look closely,
you can see a little bump...

307
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,308
...where the nose used to be.

308
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,145
But enough about fish.

309
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,254
I can discuss other things,
you know.

310
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,855
Architecture.

311
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,484
- You know what room Testikov's in?
- Yeah...

312
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,959
...308. I'm crazy for doing this.

313
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,826
Well, you want your organizer back,
don't you?

314
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,024
Why are you so interested?

315
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,829
- You wanna take her out?
- When Superman saves someone...

316
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,734
...nobody asks if he's trying
to hit on her.

317
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,808
- Well, you're not Superman.
- Well, you're not Lois Lane.

318
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,773
- You got the tape recorder?
- Yeah. You sure you wanna do this?

319
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,440
I gotta get Testikov on tape.
If this woman ends up...

320
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,247
<i>...in the New England Journal of
Medicine, I'm not gonna pay for it.</i>

321
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,549
Oh, here she comes.

322
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

323
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,121
Elaine, this is Corinne.

324
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,728
- Hello.
- Hi. You got the organizer?

325
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,662
Let's go. We'll meet you in 10
minutes, hopefully with the money.

326
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,068
Your parents must be
so proud of you, George.

327
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,502
Oh, they're busting.

328
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,005
What are those people
doing over there?

329
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,674
What? Come in.
Come in, Miss Benes.

330
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,412
That is, if you can spare a minute
from your busy schedule.

331
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,182
Now do you bring guest
for my entertainment?

332
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,258
Yeah, this is my friend Jerry.

333
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,859
He accompanied me.

334
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,724
Single women in a big city
can be dangerous, so...

335
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:43,857
That's why I wear these sneakers.
In case of any trouble, zip, I'm gone.

336
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,699
Yeah, yeah. The sneakers.
All the Americans with the sneakers.

337
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,034
You're always running
from something.

338
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,938
Yeah, yeah. Well, sit. Stop running.

339
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,509
Two minutes,
I give you latest manuscript.

340
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,382
<i>Oh, Rimsky.</i>

341
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,110
Great, great book,
if I may say so, sir.

342
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,754
I almost read the whole thing.

343
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,718
- What?
- If you can't turn that thing off...

344
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,657
...I'll have to ask you to leave.

345
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,265
- I'm waiting for two people.
- Well, you can wait for them outside.

346
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,025
Yeah, I guess I'd better.

347
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,466
I wouldn't wanna take any attention
away from the hookers.

348
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,299
All right. All right. Out. Out.

349
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,544
Whatever you say, Crowell.

350
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,813
What's going on over here?

351
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,679
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.

352
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,320
Is anyone here a marine biologist?

353
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,452
Here is latest draft.

354
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,564
I see you next week,
same time, same day.

355
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,563
- On time, please.
- Okay.

356
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,964
It was nice meeting you.
You're a real pleasure.

357
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,398
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,001
Oh, by the way, Mr. Testikov...

359
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,437
...do you remember the other day
when we were in the limo and...

360
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,278
...my organizer started making noise,
and you threw it out the window?

361
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes. How can I forget?

362
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,592
Well, would you believe that
it actually hit somebody in the head?

363
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,751
Right in the head.

364
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,092
What is that noise?

365
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,261
That's nothing.

366
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,868
- And anyway-
- What's going on?

367
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,530
- That noise.
- No, no. That's my purse.

368
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,799
- That noise.
- No. Get off my purse.

369
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,966
- It's a recorder!
- No, that's - Radio.

370
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,611
You are spying on me.

371
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,234
- Save the whale.
- You've got to do it.

372
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,370
Save the whale, George.

373
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,096
For me.

374
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,287
<i>So I started to walk into the water.</i>

375
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,462
<i>I won't lie to you, boys.</i>

376
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,459
I was terrified.

377
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,329
But I pressed on. And as I made
my way past the breakers...

378
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,436
...a strange calm came over me.

379
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,630
I don't know if it was
divine intervention...

380
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,900
...but I tell you, Jerry,
at that moment...

381
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,441
...I was a marine biologist.

382
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,239
George, I've just been reading
this thing in the paper.

383
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,113
- It's unbelievable.
- I know. I was just telling the story.

384
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,187
Well, come on, George.
Finish the story.

385
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,855
The sea was angry that day,
my friends.

386
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,397
Like an old man trying
to send back soup in a deli.

387
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,602
I got about 50 feet out,
when suddenly...

388
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,710
...the great beast
appeared before me.

389
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,870
I tell you, he was 10 stories high
if he was a foot.

390
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,945
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

391
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,086
I said, "Easy, big fella."

392
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,286
And then, as I watched
him struggling, I realized...

393
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,723
...that something was obstructing
its breathing.

394
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,023
From where I was standing, I could
see into the eye of the great fish.

395
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,063
- Mammal.
- Whatever.

396
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,400
- What did you do next?
- Well, then...

397
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,437
...from out of nowhere,
a huge tidal wave lifted me...

398
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,667
...tossed me like a cork,
and I found myself on top of him...

399
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,471
...face to face with the blowhole.

400
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,706
I could barely see from the waves
crashing down upon me...

401
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,077
...but I knew something was there.

402
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,879
So I reached my hand in...

403
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,750
...felt around, and pulled out
the obstruction.

404
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,276
What is that, a Titleist?

405
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,483
A hole in one, huh?

406
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,591
- The crowd must have gone wild.
- Oh, yes, yes.

407
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,496
Yes, Jerry. They were all over me.

408
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,727
<i>It was like Rocky I.</i>

409
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,004
Diane came up to me...

410
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,742
...threw her arms around me...

411
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,308
...kissed me.

412
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,442
We both had tears
streaming down our faces.

413
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,549
I never saw anyone so beautiful.

414
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,545
It was at that moment
that I decided to tell her...

415
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,816
...that I was not a marine biologist.

416
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:08,915
What did she say?

417
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,029
Told me to go to hell
and I took the bus home.

418
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,358
All right. Let's go.

419
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,699
- What, are you in a bad mood?
- No.

420
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,962
Got my laundry back.

421
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,667
- Golden Boy?
- He didn't make it.

422
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,310
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

423
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,871
This is Golden Boy's son...

424
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,515
...Baby Blue.

425
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,685
- What's with you?
- This sand.

426
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,752
- It's everywhere.
- Yep.
